Doodoo doot doo, dadada daa,

1,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell are you so happy about, fatass?! [Cartman gets off his bike]"
2,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[coolly] Oh, nothing. No big deal, really."
3,5,4,Stan Marsh,What's no big deal?
4,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, guys, it seems that I am the first one of us to reach manhood after all."
5,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,...What the hell are you talking about?!
6,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, because, unlike you guys, I just got my first pubes! Ayada da daa, yadadadadee! [dances]"
7,5,4,Kenny McCormick,(You got pubes??)
8,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What's ""pubes""?"
9,5,4,Stan Marsh,Pubic hair. He's saying he got his first pubic hair.
10,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,Oh. [to Cartman] No you didn't!
11,5,4,Eric Cartman,Oh yes I did! I'm becoming a man!
12,5,4,Stan Marsh,"He's lying. [turns and walks away. Kenny follows, then Kyle]"
13,5,4,Eric Cartman,You wanna see 'em?
14,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,[turns to look at them] Hell no! [Stan and Kenny turn to look]
15,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[reaches into his pants] Here, check 'em out."
16,5,4,Stan Marsh,"[looks away and hides his eyes] We don't wanna see them, Cartman! [Kyle turns around, Kenny shuts his hood tight]"
17,5,4,Eric Cartman,"There, see?! How do you like them apples! [in his right hand is a clump of pubic hair. The other boys look, with Kyle ready to cover his eyes again] HA!"
18,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,[approaches] Uh what are those? [Stan and Kenny follow]
19,5,4,Eric Cartman,My pubes.
20,5,4,Stan Marsh,What??
21,5,4,Eric Cartman,I got 'em from Scott Tenorman.
22,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,Scott Tenorman? The ninth grader?
23,5,4,Eric Cartman,Yup. He let me have 'em for just ten bucks.  [sing-song] Ha ha ha! I got pubes 'fore you guys did! I got pubes 'fore youuu guys! Ahahahahahahaa ha! [dances a little more]
24,5,4,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you are so goddamned stupid, it's unbelievable."
25,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[moves in between Stan and Kyle and embraces them, one under each arm, and gloats. Kyle looks at Cartman's right hand] Don't be jealous, guys. [Kyle looks at Cartman] This doesn't mean we can't still hang out. [Kyle looks back at Cartman's hand] It just means that I matured faster than you. [Kyle fears for that hair touching him] You'll get your pubes guys, someday."
26,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you don't buy pubes, you grow them yourself!"
27,5,4,Eric Cartman,Uh oo what?
28,5,4,Stan Marsh,"When you get old enough, you grow your own pubic hair that's attached to you, you fuckin' dumbass!"
29,5,4,Eric Cartman,Nuh uh!
30,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yuh huh!
31,5,4,Eric Cartman,[looks at his purchase] But then why would Scott Tenorman sell me his pubes for ten dollars?
32,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Because, retard, you're dumb enough to buy Scott Tenorman's pubes for ten dollars!"
33,5,4,Eric Cartman,You're telling me these pubes are worth nothing.
34,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
35,5,4,Eric Cartman,[walks off in a huff] Huh I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.
36,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"And so I told him, I said ""Here. I'll sell you my pubes for only ten bucks."" And this stupid asshole buys them! [the other two boys laugh]"
37,5,4,Another boy,Oh man! [Cartman makes his way up to the boys]
38,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Speak of the devil! What do you want?
39,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh, yes, I've come to return these pubes that I purchased, please?"
40,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Uh uh, I don't take returns!"
41,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Right, but you see, I didn't realize, when I bought these pubes from you, that you were full of shit! So you can either give me back my ten dollars, or I can go tell my mom on you!"
42,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"You would actually tell your mom that you were stupid enough to pay for my pubes? Huh uh, I don't think so!"
43,5,4,Eric Cartman,Just give me back my money...
44,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Buyer beware, dude!"
45,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Gimme my ten dollars, Scott!"
46,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Hehey, I said no! Now get your fat little butt out of here before I kick your head in! [defeated, Cartman walks away]"
47,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[in costume, with briefcase] Hello, sir, my name is Kris
Kristofferson. I'm with the IRS. I'm here to collect ten dollars that you own in back taxes."
48,5,4,Scott Tenorman,You're not from the IRS! You glued my pubes onto your face!
49,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[thinks a bit] Tax evasion is a very serious offense, sir! I suggest that you..."
50,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Alright alright. I'll trade you my pubes back for the money.
51,5,4,Eric Cartman,"You will? Oh, cool!"
52,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"How much did I charge? Uh, oh yeah. Ten dollars. You got change for a twenty?"
53,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Uh, lessee. [pulls out some money] I only got six dollars and twelve cents."
54,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Oh. well... that's okay. Here. Just... give me the six dollars. [done.] And then I'll... give you the twenty.
55,5,4,Eric Cartman,...Okay.
56,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Now, give me the pubes, and I'll give you back two dollars."
57,5,4,Eric Cartman,Right.
58,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Now, give me the twelve cents, and I'll give you the rest of your change back."
59,5,4,Eric Cartman,Cool.
60,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"And then give me the twenty, and I'll give you the pubes. [walks back in the house with his money back]"
61,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Sweet! [the door closes] Uh. Oh, goddamnit!"
62,5,4,Eric Cartman,"That asshole! That big, smelly, ass-sniffin' asshole! I'm gonna get him!"
63,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, can I give you some advice?"
64,5,4,Eric Cartman,What?!
65,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Just let it go, dude. You only had sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Count all your losses and move on. He's smarter than you."
66,5,4,Eric Cartman,"He is not smarter than me! He just charmed me, that's all! He's a charmer, that Scott Tenorman!! But I'll get him someday!! [the boys reach the box office and buy their tickets]"
67,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,One please.
68,5,4,Stan Marsh,One please.
69,5,4,Kenny McCormick,(One please.)
70,5,4,Eric Cartman,"One please. [with no money, he tries to pay with pubic hair. Nothing happens for a while]"
71,5,4,Clerk,That'll be six dollars.
72,5,4,Eric Cartman,"O-kay, and how much is that in pubes?"
73,5,4,Clerk,We don't take pubes!
74,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Listen, my money is as good as anybody's! Don't you, uh, discriminate against my people by not accepting these pubes."
75,5,4,Clerk,We don't take pubes!! End of story!!
76,5,4,Eric Cartman,Racist! [takes the pubes and runs off]
77,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Scott, Scott! Courtney Love is in South Park! She's all drunk and spreading her legs and showing her poonanner to everybody! You gotta go check it out! I'll watch your house for ya!"
78,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Okay, I'll buy the pubes back! Here!"
79,5,4,Eric Cartman,[stunned] What?
80,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Sixteen dollars! Take it! I-I'll even throw in an extra five! Here! Give me back my pubes!
81,5,4,Eric Cartman,[softly] Wha-? Uh oo [audibly] why do you want then back so much?
82,5,4,Scott Tenorman,No reason.
83,5,4,Eric Cartman,I don't believe you.
84,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Alright alright! The pube fair in Fort Collins.
85,5,4,Eric Cartman,Pube fair?
86,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"They're paying five bucks a hair for pubes! If I leave now, I can catch the last bus!"
87,5,4,Eric Cartman,Five bucks a hair? The- that's like a million dollars!
88,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Hehere, take your money!"
89,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Hoho, I don't think so, Scott! I'm going to Fort Collins myself!"
90,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Oh, you can't do this to me! Nooo!"
91,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Haha, charade you are, Scott! [runs away quickly]"
92,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Have you no heart??
93,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[cuts through the line] Ahaaa, what a stupid asshole! Hahahahaha! [enters the bus]"
94,5,4,Eric Cartman,Hohoho! I won a million dollars!! Whew! Ow!
95,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Hahaaha! Ha. Ha. Heh. Huh, excuse me, sir."
96,5,4,Man in Fort Collins,Yes?
97,5,4,Eric Cartman,Can you tell me where the pube fair is?
98,5,4,Man in Fort Collins,The pube fair?
99,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I have some pubes to sell."
100,5,4,Man in Fort Collins,"There's no such thing, you little smartass! [walks away]"
101,5,4,Eric Cartman,No- no such thing?
102,5,4,Teen boy,"[approaches with a box] Hey, you wouldn't happen to be Eric Karp-man, would you?"
103,5,4,Eric Cartman,I'm Eric Cartman!
104,5,4,Teen boy,"Well, I think this is for you. [hands it to Cartman and walks away. Cartman sets the box down and opens it. He looks in, and a look of shock is on his face. He reaches in and pulls out... more pubic hair]"
105,5,4,Eric Cartman,[screams] Aaah!!!
106,5,4,Eric Cartman,"A hundred and six miles, Scott. I had to ride a hundred and six miles in the back of a pickup truck... to get back here"
107,5,4,Scott Tenorman,You really went? What a 'tard.
108,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright, Scott, you win. I give up."
109,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"You do? Wow, you're not as stupid as I thought."
110,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'll see you around. [walks down the steps and towards the street, but stops] Sure is too bad about my grandma, though..."
111,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Your grandma?
112,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Huh? Oh, it's... it's not really your concern, since uh-... well, my grandma's in the hospital. She's very sick. The doctors say unless I can come up with sixteen dollars for her operation, they're gonna put her down."
113,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Oh. [strokes his chin] Jeez, I-... I didn't realize that."
114,5,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Poor grandma...
115,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Hey, kid... Hold on a second ah, ah, I'll get your money. [through the window, Scott is seen going for the money]"
116,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[evilly, to himself] Heheheheheh. He's such a douche, heheheheheh. [turns around and returns to the house. Scott returns]"
117,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Here you go.
118,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, wow, thanks a lot, Scott! [Scott withholds the money]"
119,5,4,Scott Tenorman,But... just one thing before I give it to you:
120,5,4,Eric Cartman,What?
121,5,4,Scott Tenorman,I just... well... I want you to beg for it.
122,5,4,Eric Cartman,Huh?
123,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Just... get down on your knees and- beg me for the money.
124,5,4,Eric Cartman,Why??
125,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Do you want your grandma to live or not?!
126,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[looks around to make sure no one else is watching, then quickly] Please Scott give me my money."
127,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Nono, get down on your knees. [Cartman begins to get on his knees] Lower your head [Cartman lowers it], and say ""I beg you to give me back my money."""
128,5,4,Eric Cartman,I beg you to give me back my money.
129,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Now say, ""I'm a little piggy."""
130,5,4,Eric Cartman,What?!
131,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Say it!
132,5,4,Eric Cartman,[looks around] I'm a little piggy.
133,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[points to his nose] ""Here's my snout."""
134,5,4,Eric Cartman,[points to his nose] Here's my snout.
135,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"""Oink oink oink."""
136,5,4,Eric Cartman,Oink oink oink.
137,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Now dance, little piggy! Dance and oink for me!"
138,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[looks back angrily for a few seconds, then]
I'm a little piggy; here's my snout.
Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.
[Scott begins to laugh]
I'm a little piggy; here's
- Aalrightalrightalright, now give me back my money!"
139,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"You mean this? [Cartman brightens up] You really care that much about sixteen measly dollars? I mean, what can you buy with sixteen dollars?! My parents give me a fifty dollar-a-week allowance. This pittance means nothing to me. Watch. [holds the bills out and strikes a lighter under them]"
140,5,4,Eric Cartman,What- What are you doing?? [the bills light up and burn from one end to the other. Scott lets the burning bills float away] No!.. wuh...why?
141,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Now you can't bug me for your dumb money! [turns around and enters the house, shutting the door behind him. Cartman then turns and walks towards the street anew. Halfway there, he looks at his mitts, then grows indignant]"
142,5,4,Eric Cartman,[yells] Yaaaarrgh! ...You'll diiiiiiiiiie! ...Damn youuuuuuuuuu!
143,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[descending the stairs] Concerned citizens, I thank you for coming. [walks to the easel] I know that you are all deeply troubled and want to find a quick and painful way to get rid of Scott Tenorman once and for all! [Clyde raises his hand] Yes, Clyde!"
144,5,4,Clyde Donovan,Who's Scott Tenorman?
145,5,4,Kids,Yeah.
146,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Scott Tenorman is an eighth grader who sold Cartman his pubes for ten dollars, and now Cartman's all pissed off."
147,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[correcting Kyle] Sixteen dollars and twelve cents! He is a disease. He is a cold calculating mind, and I will have revenge!"
148,5,4,Butters Stotch,Wuh what are you gonna do?
149,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Did you guys see that movie ""Hannibal""? Where the deformed guy trained giant pigs to eat his enemy alive?? Well, if we find a pony [flips the first page over to reveal a drawing of a pony and takes up the pointer with his left hand], we can train it. Train it... to bite off Scott Tenorman's wiener. [the other kids just stare back, but Cartman continues] It will be painful and humiliating! Everyone will see it happen! And then, Scott Tenorman will forever be known as the kid who had his wiener bitten off by a pony!!! WAHAHAHAHAA!!!"
150,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,What's in it for us?
151,5,4,Eric Cartman,What?
152,5,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, why should we all care about getting Scott Tenorman back for you?"
153,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, right. Why should we care? [slaps the pointer into his right hand] Yes, why should we care? Indeed, eh. Let's just let Scott Tenorman walk away with my sixteen dollars and twelve cents. Hell, let's let all the Scott Tenormans of the world take what's ours and laugh in our faces. Why stand up for yourselves when you can just walk out of here right now and say, ""It's not your problem."" But... years from now, when you're old and have children of your own, what would you give to come back and fight this one day? This one day, when you could have made a difference! Where you could have told Scott Tenorman, ""You may take our pride, but you'll never take my Goddamned sixteen dollars and twelve cents!!"" [flips to the next page, which has written on it ""$16.12"" with double underline] Now who's with me?!! [turns around to find only one other person in the basement]"
154,5,4,Timmy Burch,Timmay!
155,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[slaps his forehead and sighs] Christ. Alright, I guess it's just you and me, Timmy!"
156,5,4,Timmy Burch,"Euuh, livin' a lie, Timmih. [rolls out of the room. Cartman is stunned, then angry]"
157,5,4,Eric Cartman,"There we go. [stands aside] Come and get it. [camera pulls back to reveal a pony nearby] ...Come on, pony, bite the wiener. Bite it. [the pony looks, then approaches] Come on, good pony. That's it! [the pony sniffs the wiener] Now, bite it off! Bite off the wiener! Good pony! [the pony bares its teeth... only to start licking the wiener] Oh no, pony, he'll like that."
158,5,4,Jimbo Kern,[rushing up with Ned after eying Cartman in the corral] Eric! Are you training that pony to please you?!
159,5,4,Eric Cartman,"No, I'm trying to teach it how to bite someone's penis off. [by this time, the pony is sucking on the wiener]"
160,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Oh. Well, does Mr. Denkins know you're usin' his pony? He shoots trespassers on sight, you know."
161,5,4,Eric Cartman,He said it was okay.
162,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Alright, then. [turns to walk away, but remembers something] Wait, why the hell are you trainin' Denkins' pony to bite off someone's penis?"
163,5,4,Eric Cartman,Because [ominously] of Scott Tenorman! I hate him! And I want to make him suffer!
164,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, son, I think you have a pretty stupid plan there."
165,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[noticing the sucking] Not like that, pony! [slaps the wiener out of its mouth]"
166,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Look, if you wanna get revenge on somebody, you've gotta think like a hunter. [the pony reaches for the wiener and starts sucking it again]"
167,5,4,Eric Cartman,Whattayou mean?
168,5,4,Jimbo Kern,Step 1: Find someone's weakness. Step 2: Exploit that weakness.
169,5,4,Eric Cartman,How do I do that?
170,5,4,Jimbo Kern,[pops up] What do you see? [Ned pops up. All three are in camouflage]
171,5,4,Eric Cartman,I see Scott Tenorman. With his ginger red hair and his stupid freckles and his- Goddmnit goddamnit I hate him!!!
172,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"No, young hunter. I mean, what do you see? You must learn all you can about your kill."
173,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Right, right. Let's see... There's posters. Radiohead posters! And he's reading a magazine about Radiohead!"
174,5,4,Jimbo Kern,Oo what's a Radiohead?
175,5,4,Eric Cartman,"You know, that band that sings that song: Well, I'm a creep. I'm a winner..."
176,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,Mmuh what am I doing here?
177,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, Jesus, don't start singing, Ned!"
178,5,4,Eric Cartman,"So, the subject is a big Radiohead fan, huh? Maybe I should come up with a [British accent] li'l ol' scheme [normal] that involves them."
179,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Nice thinking, young hunter."
180,5,4,Eric Cartman,Whoa!
181,5,4,Jimbo Kern,What?
182,5,4,Eric Cartman,I'm looking in Scott's parents' room. Scott's mom's about to take off her bra.
183,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"What?! Give me those! [rips the binoculars away and looks for himself] Holy crow, he's right, Ned! Mrs. Tenorman's lettin' the twins out!"
184,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,Mn let me see.
185,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Radiohead. Yes, of course. [drops down]"
186,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Dear God, they're bigger than I ever imagined!"
187,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,Let me see. Let me see.
188,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Here you go. [allows Ned to look through the binoculars, and Ned begins to masturbate] Wow, those are great. Maybe I should go grab some beers, Ned. Ned, what- a-are you jackin' it?"
189,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,Kinda.
190,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, stop it! [the porch light turns on and Mr. Tenorman walks out the front door. Jimbo and Ned freeze]"
191,5,4,Mr Tenorman,"Hey, what the hell are you doing out there?!"
192,5,4,Jimbo Kern,[hushed] Oh crap!
193,5,4,Mr Tenorman,Who's out there?
194,5,4,Jimbo Kern,"[hushed] Ned, for Christ's sake, stop jackin'!"
195,5,4,Ned Gerblansky,I can't.
196,5,4,Mr Tenorman,"Don't think I don't see you! I know who you are and I'm calling the police! [Jimbo and Ned witness other men rise from the pushes and split. Among them are Randy, in a Groucho Marx outfit; Gerald, dressed as a clown; Stuart, with a paper shopping bag over his head; one man in scuba gear, and one more man]"
197,5,4,A man,"Whoa, I gotta get out of here! [Mr. Tenorman is left wondering why so many men were there.]"
198,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[cheerfully] Oh, hey, Scott. How's it goin'? I was just wondering, do you like the band, uh, Radiohead at all?"
199,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Uh huh.
200,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, really? Oh, 'cause, they're doin' a big interview on MTV, and they're playing it tonight on a big screen downtown. [gloats] Everyone's gonna be there!"
201,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Oh, cool. Um, thanks for tellin' me."
202,5,4,Eric Cartman,"You're welcome, Scott. [turns and walks away]"
203,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Well, it looks like everyone is here. Let's play the video, shall we? [activates the screen and then walks off stage]"
204,5,4,Kurt Loder,"Welcome back to MTV. We're here with the members from Radiohead, probably the hottest band in the world right now. [Cartman joins the crowd and stands next to Scott, his mood changing from happy to mad] Guys, when is the next album coming out?"
205,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[has taped over the band's answers with his own — first as Thom Yorke] That's an interesting question, Kurt. But first I'd just like to say that I really hate this kid named Scott Tenorman. He's stupid. [now as Johnny Greenwood] Yeah, I hate Scott Tenorman too. [Now as Ed O'Brien] I think all the guys in the band hate him, right guys?"
206,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, did you hear that, Scott? [Scott looks down, and ponders Cartman's role]"
207,5,4,Kurt Loder,And will there be a new tour?
208,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[Now as Phil Selway] Well, we would tour, but we just hate that Scott Tenorman kid so much that we don't want to. [Now as Thom Yorke] Yeah. Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! He's not cool!"
209,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Wow, that really sucks for you, Scott. [Scott is gone] Scott? Ha haha ha ha ha! Did you see that? Scott mast have ran home so embarrassed! Ha ha ha ha. And you know what? That wasn't really Radiohead talking! I just dubbed their voices over! HAHAHAHA! [feedback is heard] What a retard! [the kids around him face right] And now everyone saw it! [looks around]"
210,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[off screen] Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's time for the amazing Pube Boy! [moves aside to show an ever bigger TV, which is turned on. Scott has apparently filmed Cartman earlier begging for his money]"
211,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[on screen] '""I'm a little piggy; here's my snout. Oink oink oink, oink oink oink.""' [the kids begin to laugh hard, then harder. The same clip is shown over and over, and Kenny begins to laugh. Soon he can't control himself, and falls over dead. His ghost appears and continues laughing]"
212,5,4,Stan Marsh,"[looks over at Kenny's corpse] Oh my God, he killed Kenny."
213,5,4,Eric Cartman,[seething with anger] That does it! I'm gonna get Scott Tenorman once and for all!!!
214,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Hueah. You think you're so cool, Scott Tenorman? We'll see how cool you feel after this-uh! Yes. Yes! Yes!! [goes into whispers and brings out a protractor and a compass] Then... that... [finishes his plan] Hahaha, hahahaha! Yes! It is the most genius plan ever!! Scott Tenorman is going to wish he never met meee!!! [a truly evil grin appears on his face.]"
215,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Cartman, what do you want?"
216,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Stan, Kyle, thanks for coming. I have it all figured out!"
217,5,4,Stan Marsh,Got what all figured out?
218,5,4,Eric Cartman,How to get Scott Tenorman back!
219,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[rolls his eyes] Oh, Jesus!"
220,5,4,Eric Cartman,"I just finished planning a brilliant [British accent] li'l scheme [normal] that should put Scott in his place for good! And if you help me, I'll give each of you... two... dollars. [holds out two fingers]"
221,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, so what's the plan?"
222,5,4,Eric Cartman,"It's the brilliant combination of my last two plans. Scott Tenorman's favorite band is Radiohead, right?"
223,5,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
224,5,4,Eric Cartman,"So, I realized, 'What if we got Radiohead to come here to South Park?' right? Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — and — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! [camera pulls back to reveal the setup: pony, scarecrow with wiener attached to groin]"
225,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,...What?
226,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Don't you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott's wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! [laughs demonically] Okay, I'll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! [nothing happens for a few seconds]"
227,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You're such a dumbass, Cartman. [he and Stan turn and walk away]"
228,5,4,Eric Cartman,"...Fine, I'll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! [walks over to the pony] Ready, pony? [the pony nods] Bite it! [the pony bites off a piece of the wiener] Yes!! [exults]"

Dear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I'm a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I'm afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won't you please consider it? I don't think he'll make it past... next Tuesday around 5."

236,5,4,Scott Tenorman,What do you want?!
237,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is goin' tuh try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins' ranch."
238,5,4,Scott Tenorman,How do you know?
239,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"'Cause, we're his friends."
240,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Thennn why are you telling me?
241,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,'Cause we hate him.
242,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Oh.
243,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we just thought we'd let you know. See ya."
244,5,4,Scott Tenorman,See ya. [the doorbell rings. Scott walks over to open the door]
245,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[with tickets in hand] Hello, Scott!"
246,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Hey.
247,5,4,Eric Cartman,"I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It's a chili cook-off with rides. [shows him the face of the ticket] Everyone's coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!"
248,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great."
249,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[getting smug] Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won't wanna miss it, Scott.Oh, and here! Here's a coupon good for one free pony ride!"
250,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Wow, a pony ride. Neat."
251,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, it will be very neat, Scott."
252,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?"
253,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] A little penis-biting, perhaps?"
254,5,4,Scott Tenorman,What?
255,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you'll come for sure then, Scott?"
256,5,4,Scott Tenorman,How can I turn it down?
257,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. [Scott turns around and closes the door] Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. [leaves]"
258,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there's a starving pony at Denkins' ranch that's been abandoned."
259,5,4,Mrs Tenorman,Oh dear.
260,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don't know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do."
261,5,4,Mr Tenorman,"[drops his paper. Both parents rise] Well, don't you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter."
262,5,4,Mrs Tenorman,We sure can.
263,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now."
264,5,4,Mrs Tenorman,"[hugs him] Oh, Scott, you're such a loving, caring boy. I'm so proud of you."
265,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"I'm proud of you, too, Mom."
266,5,4,Mrs Tenorman,"Let's go, hon. [heads for the door]"
267,5,4,Mr Tenorman,Let's. [follows her out]
268,5,4,Buddy 1,"What are you doing, Scott?"
269,5,4,Scott Tenorman,What's it look like? I'm making chili. Did you bring the goods?
270,5,4,Buddy 2,[holds out a bag full of hair] We got everyone we could find to chip in. [his friend giggles] There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.
271,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Awesome! [yanks the bag away, opens it, and mixes the pubes into the chili]"
272,5,4,Buddy 1,"Oh, dude!"
273,5,4,Scott Tenorman,The little fat kid thinks he's gonna get revenge tomorrow. We'll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!
274,5,4,Buddy 2,"Yeah! [hi-fives Scott, and the three laugh heartily]"
275,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[steps out of the ticket booth to greet them] Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!"
276,5,4,Stan Marsh,"This is the dumbest thing you've ever done, Cartman."
277,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[smug] Ohoho, it won't be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!"
278,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oho, we will. Trust us. We won't miss this. [looks at Stan, who's smiling]"
279,5,4,Eric Cartman,What's so funny?
280,5,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh nothing, it's just cool how you're gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?"
281,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Not yet, but they will be."
282,5,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, sure. [As Chef arrives, Stan and Kyle leave]"
283,5,4,Chef,"Hello, Eric!"
284,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey, Chef."
285,5,4,Chef,I made some chili to enter into the contest.
286,5,4,Eric Cartman,What contest?
287,5,4,Chef,"This is a chili cook-off, ain't it?"
288,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here."
289,5,4,Chef,It's my special recipe.
290,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[seeing Scott, interrupts. Slowly and sweetly] Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! [Scott holds a small container of chili]"
291,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Oh, I wouldn't miss this for anything."
292,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[overjoyed] Likewise. Well, come on, you've got to see the pony!"
293,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Just a second: don't you- wanna taste my chili first?
294,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, e-yeah, but, there's a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive."
295,5,4,Scott Tenorman,Well I don't want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.
296,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[sighs silently] Alright, Scott, uh. Let's go over to the judging table and we'll try the chili first. [Scott leaves] Goddamnit!"
297,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[setting his plate before Cartman] Alright, I guess we should taste each other's chili, huh?"
298,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[inspecting the dish] Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here's mine. [hands his plate to Scott, who takes it to his end of the table and starts eating]"
299,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Mmm. Ah, I don't know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it."
300,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright. [takes the dish and starts eating. Both boys munch away for a few moments] Hey, this is great! [Stan and Kyle stifle giggles]"
301,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"Eh, it's a special recipe."
302,5,4,Eric Cartman,"[begins to wolf down the food] Gawh, this is really good, Scott!"
303,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"I'm glad you like it so much, because now that you're almost finished, I have some'in' to tell you."
304,5,4,Eric Cartman,"What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? [Everyone at Scott's end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]"
305,5,4,Scott Tenorman,What?!
306,5,4,Eric Cartman,"Yehes, I'm afraid this isn't your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef's. [Chef looks like he's been used] It's delicious, Chef. I hadn't planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. [Stan and Kyle are stunned] I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn't tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. [A shot of Cartman telling Denkins of such a thing. Denkins is armed] I also know that you wouldn't go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. [A shot of Scott talking with his parents] And, I'm afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. [The Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the ""starving"" pony, but upon seeing Mr. Tenorman's lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them, and they go down]"
307,5,4,Mr Denkins,"[looks of horror surround him] Well, they was trespassin' and I was protectin' myself. I, I have my rights."
308,5,4,Scott Tenorman,My... mom and dad are... dead? [A shot of Officer Barbrady taking a report from Denkins]
309,5,4,Eric Cartman,"I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... [A shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away. The pony munches at some grass] After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. [more faces of horror behnd Cartman] Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? [A gleefully evil look comes over Cartman] I call it, ""Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."""
310,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[looks at Cartman for a while, realizing what's just happened] Oh my God! [gagging, he fishes through the plate and finds his mom's wedding ring, still on her finger. He tosses it away] Oh my God!! [vomits off to the side]"
311,5,4,Eric Cartman,[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are way stunned]
312,5,4,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ, dude!"
313,5,4,Scott Tenorman,"[grief-stricken, he buries his face on the table] My mom and dad are dead! [pounds the table] No! NOOO!! [Radiohead arrives and stands behind Scott. Stan notices]"
