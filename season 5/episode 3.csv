1,5,3,Stan Marsh,"What's going on? [he and Kyle have ice cream cones. He has vanilla, Kyle strawberry]"
2,5,3,Butters Stotch,"Uh this feller David Blaine. He's doin' magic tricks. Hey, where'd you get that ice cream?"
3,5,3,David Blaine,"Okay, now hold this card up to the crowd. [Carol takes the card and shows it to the crowd. It is an ace of clubs] Was that the card you picked?"
4,5,3,Carol,"No, I'm sorry. I picked the four of hearts."
5,5,3,David Blaine,Four of hearts? Really? Look again.
6,5,3,Carol,[looks and find the four of hearts in her hand] Daa-ah!
7,5,3,Crowd,Oooohhhh! [applause]

9,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"That's pretty cool, dude!"
10,5,3,Eric Cartman,[walking up] Who's this asshole?
11,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"He's a magician named David Blaine, dude. He kicks ass."
12,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, where'd you guys get that ice cream?"
13,5,3,David Blaine,"Sir, c- could you come over here? [Jimbo walks over] Now, what I want you to do, Mr..."
14,5,3,Jimbo,Kern.
15,5,3,David Blaine,"Mr. Kern, I want you to just... think about a card. Pick any card, and picture it in your mind."
16,5,3,Jimbo,[shuts his eyes and keeps them shut] O-kay.
17,5,3,David Blaine,"Okay, jus... s think about your card. [a few seconds pass] okay, look at me. [Jimbo looks at him] Look at me... Look at me... okay, now reach up your ass."
18,5,3,Jimbo,Huh??
19,5,3,David Blaine,"Go on, reach up your ass."
20,5,3,Jimbo,"[reaches into his ass and digs around] Uh, I don't feel nothin'."
21,5,3,David Blaine,Deeper.
22,5,3,Jimbo,[groans as he goes deeper] Hhud. I don't feel... hello... wait... wait... [pulls out a card and cleans the crap off it]
23,5,3,David Blaine,Was that the card you picked?
24,5,3,Jimbo,[in disbelief] Yes! Oh my God!
25,5,3,Man,O-hoho! [more crowd reaction]
26,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that's cool!"
27,5,3,Stan Marsh,How'd he do that??
28,5,3,David Blaine,"Thank you. I've been traveling from town to town for quite a while. I've started quite a following, mostly because of my levitation tricktwah. Watch. [goes into a meditative state] Watch. [slowly, he rises into the air]"
29,5,3,Crowd,Whoa!!!
30,5,3,Stan Marsh,No way!
31,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Damn. That guy is the coolest guy in the universe!
32,5,3,Blaintologist,"[passing out pamphlets through the crowd] Pamphlet. Pamphlet. Here you go, kids,  take a pamphlet. [Kyle takes one and reads from it]"
33,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"""David Blaine Workshop. Learn all about David Blaine at the Center for Magic."" Dude, we gotta go."
34,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and they probably teach you how to do magic tricks!"
35,5,3,Speaker,"Hello, everyone. My name is Steven and I've been a Blaintologist for about three years. So, when David Blaine performed his miracles out on the street, what moved you the most?"
36,5,3,Stan Marsh,His a-miracles?
37,5,3,Steven,"Oh yes, you see, David Blaine is much more than a magician. He's a scholar, a visionary, a leader."
38,5,3,Eric Cartman,When are we gonna learn magic tricks?
39,5,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
40,5,3,Steven,"Oh, I've got a trick for you to learn: I can show you how to make your true self appear. Let me ask you all something: Do you consider yourselves to be happy?"
41,5,3,Butters Stotch,I don't think I'm very happy. I always fall asleep to the sounds of my own screams.
42,5,3,Steven,"...Right, yeh. Eh, see, the reason that you are unha-"
43,5,3,Butters Stotch,And then I always get woken up in the morning by the sounds of my own screams. Do you think I'm unhappy?
44,5,3,Steven,"Wait, the.. the point is... that you can be happy. You see, your friends and parents have programmed you in a way that makes you feel isolated and alone. How many times have you felt like nobody knows the real... you? [focus on a stunned Kyle] You're not really happy."
45,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[thinking] I'm not really happy.
46,5,3,Steven,Your potential hasn't even been reached.
47,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[thinking] My potential hasn't even been reached.
48,5,3,Steven,"[holds up the book] If you look through David Blaine's incredible book, you'll find a lot of life's answers. Let's read some of the book together, shall we?"
49,5,3,Eric Cartman,Then we get to be in David Blaine's secret club?
50,5,3,Steven,That's right.
51,5,3,Eric Cartman,Cool.
52,5,3,Sheila Broflovski,"Ike, eat your gefilte fish. [Ike pulls away as far as he can]"
53,5,3,Ike Broflovski,No-oo.
54,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes in with Blaine's book] Mom. Mom. I found out all about this great new magician named David Blaine.
55,5,3,Sheila Broflovski,"That's nice, Kyle. Ike, eat!"
56,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"We spent all afternoon learning about how we aren't actually happy. I had no idea how unhappy I was until today. They gave me this cool book to read, and I'm already on chapter four...."
57,5,3,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, it's nice to see you so interested in something, Kyle. Ike, for the love of Abraham, you are gonna eat this."
58,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"So can I go to the Magic Camp, to learn how to become a full member? All the other guys are doin' it, and it's only $69.95."
59,5,3,Sheila Broflovski,"Magic Camp? I don't know, bubbe, ask your father. [Kyle turns and walks out] Ike, you will eat this!"
60,5,3,Barber,Prepare to be cleansed and release the magic inside you.
61,5,3,Butters Stotch,"[Solemnly] I am prepared. [the barber takes the clippers and clips Butters' hair off in one swoop. The hair ends up on the floor in one piece] Hoh, jeez, eh it sure got cold in here."
62,5,3,Barber,Next? [Mr. Garrison appears...]
63,5,3,Steven,"Congratulations, young Blaintologists. From this day, you are clean. [a shot of the new recruits. They all look the same] Now, we have very important work to do! David Blaine is going to put on a big magic show in Denver tomorrow night, where he's going to eat his own head."
64,5,3,Recruits,Wow!
65,5,3,Steven,So it's up to all you new Blaintologists to get as many people there as you can. Whoever gets the most people to come gets a prize! [eight boys gravitate towards each other]
66,5,3,Stan Marsh,"[talking to a boy between him and Cartman] Kyle, I'm starting to think that this is a really bad idea."
67,5,3,Butters Stotch,"Ha-I'm not Kyle, I'm Butters. I thought you were Kyle."
68,5,3,Stan Marsh,"No, I'm Stan."
69,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[behind Butters] You're Stan? Where's Kenny?
70,5,3,Stan Marsh,Who are you?
71,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm Kyle.
72,5,3,Eric Cartman,"[thinking he's indistinguishable] Heheh, guess who I am, guys?"
73,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I think we may have gotten into something bad here."
74,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,[steps back to join Stan] What do you mean? We're learning all kinds of cool stuff.
75,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Look at us, dude. These people are trying to change us somehow. I think it's time we went home."
76,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,But David Blaine is gonna do more miracles in Denver tomorrow.
77,5,3,Stan Marsh,"I don't care! I'm leaving! [walks towards the door, but a man blocks the way] 'Scuse me. [eerie music begins]"
78,5,3,Aide,Where are you going?
79,5,3,Stan Marsh,I'm going home.
80,5,3,Aide,You don't want to go home.
81,5,3,Stan Marsh,You said we're free to leave whenever we want
82,5,3,Aide,You are.
83,5,3,Stan Marsh,Move out of the way.
84,5,3,Aide,I'm not in the way. You are. Are you unhappy with the Church's teachings? Let's just talk about it
85,5,3,Stan Marsh,"I don't wanna talk about it, I jus' wanna leave."
86,5,3,Aide,"Why don't we go into the back room for a second, and talk? Then you can leave."
87,5,3,Stan Marsh,"[begins to back away, intimidated] That's okay, I... I changed my mind. I'm... gonna stay."
88,5,3,Aide,That's great news. [escorts Stan back to the group]
89,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Okay, it's all clear. [exits with Kyle]"
90,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,What are we doing?
91,5,3,Stan Marsh,We're getting out of here. This whole thing has gotten way out of hand.
92,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa whoa, I'm not going anywhere."
93,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kyle, this is stupid!"
94,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not stupid, Stan. For once in my life I feel like I'm part of something."
95,5,3,Stan Marsh,A part of what?! Some gaywad magician's crazy life plan?!
96,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Don't call Mr. Blaine a gaywad! He's a brilliant man.
97,5,3,Stan Marsh,"No, they've just convinced you that he's a brilliant man! Let's go!"
98,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not going anywhere!
99,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Goddamnit, I'm not going with you! I wanna stay here!"
100,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Huh? I thought you wanted to leave.
101,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh wait, who am I again?"
102,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,You're Stan.
103,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh- oh yeah. God- Goddamnnit, hold on a second. [pulls out his hat and puts it on] Okay. Now look, dude, I'm getting out of here, and you're a dumbass if you don't come with me!"
104,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Then I guess... I'm a dumbass. [turns and walks back to his room. Stan turns back to face the hall and watched Kyle walk away]
105,5,3,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, please. You- [looks down and to the left, then looks up] You're my best friend."
106,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, this is what I believe in now, Stan. And if you can't respect that,... then I guess we're not best friends anymore. [opens the door to his room and walks in. Stan looks, then turns towards the exit and walks out]"
107,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello, ma'am. My name is Kyle. And this is Cartman. We'd like to share our interest in David Blaine with you."
108,5,3,Elderly Woman,"Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I'm sorry, but I'm a Catholic."
109,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh it... doesn't matter, ma'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew."
110,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,That's right.
111,5,3,Elderly Woman,So you're not a cult?
112,5,3,Eric Cartman,"[giggles] Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC. He also wrote a book, and we'd like to share it with you."
113,5,3,Elderly Woman,"Well, alright, come on in."
114,5,3,Eric Cartman,Cool. [the woman shows the boys in]
115,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"...And if you look here, you can see how David Blaine performed the miracle of being frozen in ice at Times Square."
116,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Ma'am, have you ever wondered what David Blaine's plan is for you?"
117,5,3,Elderly Woman,"No, not really."
118,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you see, that, that's interesting because... I'm so thankful for David Blaine's book, and, I'm so thankful that he showed me the way to true happiness but, I think about his plan often."
119,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,David Blaine is doing a big performance in Denver tomorrow night. [closes his book] We're sure his magic will entertain and astound you!
120,5,3,Eric Cartman,He's going to eat his own head.
121,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,How many tickets can we put you down for?
122,5,3,Elderly Woman,"Oh, I can't go."
123,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, come on, it'll make you a happy person."
124,5,3,Elderly Woman,I am happy.
125,5,3,Eric Cartman,No you're not.
126,5,3,Elderly Woman,Yes I am.
127,5,3,Eric Cartman,No you're not.
128,5,3,Elderly Woman,I really am.
129,5,3,Eric Cartman,No you're not.
130,5,3,Elderly Woman,But I am.
131,5,3,Eric Cartman,No you're not.
132,5,3,Elderly Woman,"Alright, two tickets"
133,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Great!
134,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,That's 15 people we got to agree to come see David Blaine perform in Denver.
135,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Brother Kyle hmm, but our work is not over. We must still recruit ten more audience members in order to get the prize."
136,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I think if we try Kenny's neighborhood, we might find a- [they reach the corner. Facing them on the opposite corner is Stan, standing by his bike]"
137,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. [turns right and walks down the street. Kyle looks back at Stan for a few seconds, then follows Cartman. Stan turns and walks down the street in the same direction Kyle and Cartman were walking, but stops when a car appears in front of him. He sees some adult Blaintologists inside. The driver starts the car and moves towards Stan, who turns about face and begins to run with his bike. The car looms behind him and he lets go of his bike.]"
138,5,3,Stan Marsh,"HaaAAAA! [the car totals the bike, bumps Stan onto the sidewalk, and peels away.]"
139,5,3,Driver,"You'd better watch yourself next time, abandoner! [Stan looks at the car, scared.]"

194,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Why is that good news?

219,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. I don't think I wanna be a part of this anymore.
220,5,3,Eric Cartman,What?
221,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I think Stan might've been right. Anyway, I think it's going too far. I mean, if I kill myself, it's gonna make my family really sad."
222,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I know what you mean. I don't wanna die either. [points to his groin] I haven't even gotten my pubes yet."
223,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I think we should bail. If we leave the group, maybe other people will get the courage to leave, too."
224,5,3,Eric Cartman,"That co- ugh. [drops to a whisper] That could be difficult, Brother Kyle. But alright, listen: Why don't we sleep on it? If we decide to leave the faction, we can... do it in the morning."
225,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. Okay, you're right. [goes down the ladder to his own bunk, underneath Cartman's, and Cartman turns over to sleep] Oh uh Cartman: thanks. [goes to sleep. Later, he wakes up inside a large domed platform. Reflections of five adult Blaintologists and Cartman can be seen on the glass dome. He sits up and blinks] Cartman? [He tries to move, but encounters the glass. He taps to make sure] What the hell? [Camera pulls back to reveal...]"
226,5,3,Eric Cartman,I told on yoo-ou. I told on yoo-ou.
227,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What have you done, Cartman?!"
228,5,3,Eric Cartman,"This is for your own good, Brother Kyle."
229,5,3,David Blaine,"You must understand, brother Kyle, twah, you know too much about the Church. If you left now, you'd become a danger to our cause."
230,5,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah, and you know what else Kyle said? Um Kyyyle, he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide, that he wouldn't do iiit."
231,5,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[knocking on the dome] Cartman, you fatass tattle-tale!"
232,5,3,Eric Cartman,At least I'm not the boy in the plastic bubble!
233,5,3,David Blaine,"The suicide pact will go as planned. If we die, we all die together. [Cartman and the Blaintologists exit and leave Kyle alone, afraid]"

250,5,3,David Blaine,"[facing the audience, with the Washington Monument in the distance] If the government will not give us tax-exempt status, then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs, twah."
251,5,3,Steven,"Alright, brothers and sisters, gather around. [they do so] It's time to drown ourselves in the Reflecting Pool! [he steps down into the pool] However, the-ah Reflecting Pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought, so to drown ourselves, you will need to lie on your stomach, face down, until you die, as such.
