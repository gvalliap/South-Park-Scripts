0,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"Alright, children, as I'm sure you all remember, today we are going to continue our biology lesson... dissecting an organism."
1,4,15,Class,Yeah! [There are new seating arrangements to note: Wendy now sits to Stan's left. Timmy sits in the back of the class. Pip sits behind Kenny. Two students not seen before join the class]
2,4,15,Bebe Stevens,Woohoo.
3,4,15,New Kid,Woohoo.
4,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"[walks off] Now, what we are going to dissect today is the West Indian manatee. [return with a large dolly stacked with manatee corpses. Stan and Kyle glance at each other] Manatees are mammals that live in the oceans and are often called the gentle clowns of the sea."
5,4,15,Wendy Testaburger,"Uhh, Ms. Choksondik, aren't manatees endangered?"
6,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"They sure are, Wendy, and that's why we must learn what's inside them. [pushes the dolly towards the class and hands the manatees out] Now, we don't have quite enough [one goes to Butters] manatees to go around, so I think we're gonna have to split up into groups of four. [Stan and Annie get manatees]"
7,4,15,Butters Stotch,Hey! Ours is still alive!
8,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"[walks up and looks] Oh, hold on. [walks away. The manatee raises its head. Ms. Choksondik returns with a brick and brings it down hard on the manatee's head twice, killing it and exposing its brain. Butters is stunned. Ms. Choksondik returns to the front of the class] Now, children, our first incision will be along the abdomen."
9,4,15,Stan Marsh,"[holding his knife] I can't do it, dude."
10,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, don't be such a baby! [takes the knife, blinks, then offers it to Kenny] You do it, Kenny."
11,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh uh!)
12,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Come, on, Kenny! I'll give you five bucks to do it!"
13,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(FIVE BUCKS???) [grabs the knife and starts cutting away]
14,4,15,Stan Marsh,Too bad Cartman's missing this. He must be really sick.
15,4,15,Phillip,"Say Terrance, this body appears to have been moved since the murder. Look at the forensic evidence around the torso."
16,4,15,Terrance,I don't see anything.
17,4,15,Phillip,Look closer. [Terrance looks closer] Closer. [Terrance bends down further. Phillip holds Terrance's head down] Hunh-nh.
18,4,15,Terrance,"I still don't see anything, Phillip."
19,4,15,Phillip,Waitwait. Hunh.
20,4,15,Eric Cartman,"I know what's gonna happen, Mom. You wanna know what's gonna happen?"
21,4,15,Phillip,"[grunts softly] Keep looking, Terrance. The forensic evidence is right around here. [grunts long, farts, and cackles. The camera pulls back to reveal Terrance standing on a stool. Phillip looks to see Terrance ready to fart on him. Terrance lets loose...] Ah! [...and Phillip is blown into a nearby wall, then falls on his side] Af!"
22,4,15,Terrance,AAHahahahahahaaa!
23,4,15,Eric Cartman,Whoa! That totally surprised me! [his mom looks at him] I can't believe how the show manages to stay fresh.
24,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Eh yes, sweetie."
25,4,15,Eric Cartman,[sweetly] Mom.can you go make me a toaster pastry chocolate-mix butter ball? [grins]
26,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Oohh, honey, why don't you make it yourself? [his grin vanishes] Mommy's [looks away] expecting [looks back] some company."
27,4,15,Eric Cartman,"God, I have to everything around here!"
28,4,15,Eric Cartman,"I'mo drag home myself, babih. But the- [blinks and looks up. In the living room now with his mom are Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, and Dr. Doctor.] What the hell's going on?"
29,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Uh, sweetie, your friends wanted to have a ""talk"" with you."
30,4,15,Mr Mackey,"Eric, your friends and your family are all... concerned about your weight. M'kay?"
31,4,15,Eric Cartman,[incredulous] What?!
32,4,15,Dr Doctor,We believe that you might have a problem.
33,4,15,Eric Cartman,You're God-damn right I have a problem! Terrance and Phillip is on and I don't have anywhere to sit! Now what the hell is this?!
34,4,15,Mr Garrison,"It's called intervention, Eric."
35,4,15,Liane Cartman,Your friends and I have all chipped in and we're going to send you up to a weight-management retreat.
36,4,15,Eric Cartman,Fat camp?
37,4,15,Dr Doctor,"Yes, fat camp."
38,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Alright, I don't know who the hell put you all up to this, [grabs his creation and drops the plate on the floor] but I am sure as hell not going to any gay-ass fat camp!"
39,4,15,Mr Mackey,"Now, Eric, all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you."
40,4,15,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, except for me. I just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you."
41,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[pleading] Mom, tell them! Tell them I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned! Tell them all those stories about how everyone in your family was big as a child but then grew into their bodies!"
42,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Oh, sweetie, those were all lies. You're just fat. [Cartman is stunned. A piece of Pop Toasties falls on the floor]"
43,4,15,Ms Choksondik,And now we will be removing the spleen. Notice how the manatee's spleen is designed for a qu-
44,4,15,Principal Victoria,"[opens the door and peeks in] Ah, Ms. Choksondik, can we have a quick word with you?"
45,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"[puts down the pointer and goes towards the door] Alright, continue with the removal of the spleen, children. I'll be right back. [opens the door and exits.]"
46,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"[working on his manatee] Aw, dude, check this out. [pulls out the spleen with some scissors]"
47,4,15,Stan Marsh,[off-screen] That's so gross.
48,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Kenny. How much for you to eat this?"
49,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(I'm not eatin' that!)
50,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,I'll give you ten bucks to eat it.
51,4,15,Stan Marsh,I'll throw in five.
52,4,15,Principal Victoria,And so apparently there's been a little mixup. The manatees were meant to go to the Denver Shelter Aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here.
53,4,15,Ms Choksondik,Oh dear.
54,4,15,Butters Stotch,I'll throw in a dollar!
55,4,15,Bebe Stevens,I've got three.
56,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dude. All you gotta do is eat it very fast!"
57,4,15,Stan Marsh,"[off-screen, enticing] forty-one bucks. [Kenny jumps up and starts eating it. The others groan and moan] Eww-ho-hoo! He did it!"
58,4,15,Ms Choksondik,"[returns to the front of the class] Alright, children, now, let's get back in our seats. Uh, we are now going to put the manatees back together. [the kids blink with surprise]"
59,4,15,Liane Cartman,"...And it has basketball courts and tennis courts, and you can call Mommy any time you want. [Cartman has been looking away all this time. She looks at him] Oh, sweetie-kins, don't be mad. I'm sure you're going to have a good time. And when you come back you'll be all healthy and thin. [the station wagon pulls up to the Hopeful Hills REGISTRATION building]"
60,4,15,Male Counselor,Howdy there. I'm one of the weight counselors here. This must be Eric Cartman.
61,4,15,Liane Cartman,Yes. I'm afraid he's a little moody.
62,4,15,Male Counselor,"Oh, we'll change that. [bends down next to the passenger window] Hello, camper. My name is Rick. How are you doing?"
63,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm pissed off!, Rick! How are you?"
64,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"I'm doing great! Why don't you come on out and we'll get yo oriented. [stands up and Cartman exits the car] I'll take care of him from here, ma'am."
65,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Oh. [bows and opens her arms to hug Cartman] Well, goodbye, sweetie."
66,4,15,Eric Cartman,[darkly] Don't touch me! [moves away a bit]
67,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Eric, this is the beginning of a whole new life for you!"
68,4,15,Brunette,[to Cartman's right] Have you got any candy?
69,4,15,Eric Cartman,No.
70,4,15,Taller Boy,[to Cartman's left] My mom says I ain't to eat no candy here. I'm s'psoed to lose weight.
71,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"[walks up to the group enthusiastically] Alright! Everybody's here and that means we can get down to business! Over the next few weeks we're gonna learn that losing weight is [jumps] fun, right gang?"
72,4,15,Taller Boy,Right.
73,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Wait a second. [holds his right hand to his ear] Do you kids hear something? [drops his hand] I could've swore that-
74,4,15,Pink Monster,Raaarrrr!!! [a woman in costume]
75,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Oh no, kids! It's glutinous fat!"
76,4,15,Pink Monster,I'm gonna take over your body and make you slow! [starts hopping around]
77,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Oh! What are we going to do? Wait! I know! I could knock it out! With... Exercise! [holds up an EXERCISE paddle, strikes the monster on the head with it, and tosses it away] And... Proper Diet. [does the same with a PROPER DIET paddle]"
78,4,15,Pink Monster,Oh no! Exercise and proper diet have killed me. [falls over on her side]
79,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"I guess we took care of that bad old fat, didn't we kids?"
80,4,15,Taller Boy,Yeah! [Cartman glares at him]
81,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Well, hold on a second. Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan, [she pops out of the costume] who's another weight counselor! [she jumps out in front of the costume and exults]"
82,4,15,Taller Boy,Heh! It was a lady in a costume!
83,4,15,Eric Cartman,[miffed] Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!
84,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up with Butters] What's the matter?
85,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Kenny's not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. [Clyde and Token come in from the right, Wendy and Bebe come in from the left. Stan comforts Kenny.]"
86,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Uh oh. I guess we shouldn't have made him eat it. [Stan jumps back as Kenny starts vomiting the spleen up. Stan and Kyle watch in shock]
87,4,15,Kids,Eewww.
88,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Well, at least you got it out of your system."
89,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, dude! You can still kinda see the spleen! [Butters looks at him] How much, Kenny?"
90,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(WHAT?!)
91,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,I'll give you five bucks to eat your puke.
92,4,15,Butters Stotch,Huh-I'm in for five!
93,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Oh, you guys!"
94,4,15,Clyde Donovan,I've got three.
95,4,15,Token Black,Six!
96,4,15,Butters Stotch,"Uh-here. Uh-you can scoop it up in my R. Kelly thermos. [Kenny takes it and opens it up, then bends to scoop the vomit up into the thermos]"
97,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"That's 19 bucks, Kenny! [more kids gather]"
98,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(Ungh.) [goes ahead and eats his vomit]
99,4,15,Kids around Kenny,AAAAA!
100,4,15,Kids around Timmy,Waugh.
101,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Kick ass, dude!"
102,4,15,Stan Marsh,"You know, dude, there might be something to this."
103,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.
104,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Doing great kids! Come on! [they resume jogging and the fat kids lumber to the top of the hill panting behind them. Cartman stops and droops]
105,4,15,Eric Cartman,[resumes jogging] This... is... bullcrap!
106,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Well, I sure enjoyed my carrots and protein bar! How about you, gang?"
107,4,15,Eric Cartman,[in withdrawal] I'm starving. This is it. I'm going to die here.
108,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"[cheerfully arrives with a loaded plate] I hope you all left room for dessert. Soybean pudding for everybody! [serves a plate of the stuff to everyone there, starting with Cartman's table]"
109,4,15,Brunet Boy,[to Cartman's left] Are you going to eat your soybean pudding?
110,4,15,Eric Cartman,[shoves his plate to the boy] Take it! I can't eat this crap!
111,4,15,Blonde Girl,[to Cartman's right] Me neither. I have to have sugar or I'm going to die.
112,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[to the girl] Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass."
113,4,15,Brunet Boy,I have some Fudge 'Ems up my ass. You want some?
114,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Psss. Yeah, I'm not falling for that one again!"
115,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we're free. [sees the entrance and races for it. He exits and races through the meadow until he reaches a road.] We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? [an ice cream truck approaches him] An ice cream truck! Hey wait! [races up to the truck. The driver exits the cab] Boy, am I glad to see you!"
116,4,15,Driver,Can I interest you in some ice cream?
117,4,15,Eric Cartman,"You're damn right you can! Two Roller Pops, please!"
118,4,15,Driver,"[goes to the back of the truck, opens the doors, and pulls out one pop.] Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? [points to the inside of the truck. Cartman looks]"
119,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Hunh? [is lifted up] Uuh! [and tossed into the truck. The doors are closed behind him, and he looks up. Before him sit four other kids who have tried to escape]"
120,4,15,Boy 1,"[on bench at left]They tricked us again, huh?"
121,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[stands up] Aw, God-damnit! [turns] LET ME OUT OF HMYA! [pounds on the back doors]"
122,4,15,Driver,"Hang on, we'll be back at camp in a matter of no time. [drives into camp]"
123,4,15,Boy 1,"They always get us. Sometimes it's a ice cream truck, sometimes it's a taco stand. But they always fool us."
124,4,15,Taller Boy,Heh-I can't help it. I'd give anything. Any amount of money for some candy. [Rick and Susan pop into the campers' cabin.]
125,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Hey kids!
126,4,15,Sussan,Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.
127,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can't leave."
128,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,[bends forward sweetly a bit and cocks her head to the left] There is no escape.
129,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"So let's just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT"
130,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[pissed off] Aw, damnit!"
131,4,15,Gerald,That's what being young is all about.
132,4,15,Mr Garrison,[at the same time] But that's not the question.
133,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Thanks for coming, everybody."
134,4,15,Mr Mackey,"Uh what's all this about, Mrs. Cartman? Is Eric having trouble at havin' trouble at his weight-management camp?"
135,4,15,Stan Marsh,We knew he wouldn't make it.
136,4,15,Liane Cartman,"Oh, no. Quite the contrary. Eric showed up and surprised me last night. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you... the new Eric Cartman. [steps to one side as Cartman enters]"
137,4,15,New Cartman,"Hey, dudes!"
138,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! [the others look stunned]
139,4,15,Stan Marsh,I don't believe it.
140,4,15,Liane Cartman,Believe it. He lost 40 pounds at his fat camp. [everyone gathers round Cartman]
141,4,15,Mr Mackey,"Eric, that's fantastic, m'kay?!"
142,4,15,Principal Victoria,Congratulations. How do you feel?
143,4,15,New Cartman,I feel awesome!
144,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,What did they do with all the fat? There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.
145,4,15,New Cartman,"You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I'm totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I'd say I'm [leans a bit to eye Kyle's belly] a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy! [stands erect] Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle."
146,4,15,Liane Cartman,I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate. Who wants some?
147,4,15,Eric Cartman,Memememeee! [the group heads for the kitchen while Stan and Kyle stay behind]
148,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. I don't know if I'm going to like the new Eric Cartman.
149,4,15,Stan Marsh,Did you like the old one?
150,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Good point.
151,4,15,Announcer,"And now back to Jesus and Pals, on South Park Public Access."
152,4,15,Jesus,"[with the new Cartman] Back to our courageous story of a little boy's triumph over obesity. Eric, yea. You found that the Spirit of the Lord inside you gave you strength."
153,4,15,New Cartman,"No. Actually, I found a diet that totally works."
154,4,15,Jesus,"A little boy who overcame the odds. Let's hear it for Eric Cartman! [the studio audience applauds] Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? [Kenny enters with Stan, Kyle, and a dog. Music begins as a spotlight falls on Kenny. The dog turns his ass to Kenny and craps. A musical riff plays as Kenny picks the crap up and the audience groans with disgust. Some of them cover their eyes. Kenny lifts the crap dramatically into the air a wailing female joins the music. Another riff plays as Kenny swallows the crap. A small pedestal appears under him and pushes him up and around. The audience groans some more, Kenny finishes off the crap, and the audience beings to cheer. The new Cartman is pissed]"
155,4,15,New Cartman,"God-damnit, all I got was a little golf clap!"
156,4,15,Jesus,"[hesitant] Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny."
157,4,15,Kenny McCormick,[gracious] (Sure!)
158,4,15,Man 1,Do it again!
159,4,15,Man 2,Do it again!
160,4,15,Man 3,Hey kid! I'll give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon!
161,4,15,New Cartman,This is ridiculous! [picks at his eye]
162,4,15,Jesus,"So. Kenny, how did you discover that you had this... talent?"
163,4,15,Stan Marsh,"We thought of it, Jesus. I mean, Kenny's the one that does it all, but we were the masterminds of the whole thing."
164,4,15,Jesus,"I can't say I approve of this, my children."
165,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,[he and Stan look at Jesus for a moment] Huh? Why not?
166,4,15,Jesus,Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money. He's a prostitute.
167,4,15,Man 4,I'll pay him 50 bucks to eat someone else's vomit.
168,4,15,Man 5,Yeah!
169,4,15,Man 6,Yeah! Go for it!
170,4,15,Stan Marsh,[to Kyle] What's a prostitute?
171,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
172,4,15,Chef,"[behind the sneeze guard, as usual] Hello there, children!"
173,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Chef:"
174,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Chef:"
175,4,15,Kenny McCormick,"Hey, Chef:"
176,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
177,4,15,Chef,"[ponders, then displeased] Dag-nabbit children! How come every time you come in here you gotta be askin' me questions that I shouldn't be answering?! ""Chef, what's the clitoris?"" ""What's a lesbian, Chef?"" ""How come they call it a rimjob, Chef?"" [the boys blink. Stan and Kyle look at each other] For once, can't you just come in here and say, ""Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?""!"
178,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Hi Chef. Nice day, isn't it?"
179,4,15,Chef,[pleased] It sure is! Thank you.
180,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Chef, what's a prostitute?"
181,4,15,Chef,Uh uh! You children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again.
182,4,15,New Cartman,[joins the other boys] Lunchtime! I'm starved!
183,4,15,Chef,Oh my God. Eric?
184,4,15,New Cartman,That's me.
185,4,15,Stan Marsh,Chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is.
186,4,15,Chef,Why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway?!
187,4,15,Stan Marsh,Because Jesus told us that Kenny's a prostitute. Is he?
188,4,15,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. Am I?)
189,4,15,Chef,"Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute."
190,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
191,4,15,Chef,"Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services."
192,4,15,Stan Marsh,Like what?
193,4,15,Chef,Like keeping you company. Understand?
194,4,15,Stan Marsh,No.
195,4,15,Chef,"You see, children, sometimes a man needs to be with a woman. But sometimes, when the lovin' is over, the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk. [begins singing]
But a prostitute is someone who would love you
No matter who you are, or what you look like.
Yes, it's true, children.
[the new Cartman looks at the other boys as he starts sneaking away. They don't notice him. Other kids, Annie, Token, Clyde, Butters, and Bebe, enter the kitchen]
That's not why you pay a prostitute,
no, you don't pay her to stay, you pay her to leave afterwards.
[Principal Victoria arrives and listens]
That's why I pays a lot for prostitutes!
Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. James Taylor."
196,4,15,James Taylor,"[enters next to Chef playing a guitar]
A prostitute is like any other woman
They all trade somethin' for sex and they do it well.
[the new Cartman goes into the supply room and starts packing donuts into his backpack]"
197,4,15,Chef,And that's why I say-
198,4,15,Chef and James Taylor,Prostitutes! Prostitutes! They-
199,4,15,Chef,"Oohhhh [they stop when they see Principal Victoria, who has crossed her arms in anger] ...James Taylor, what the hell are you doin' in here?! Singing' about prostitutes to the children! Get out of here! [James leaves, but Principal Victoria is not satisfied.] ...These children tricked me!"
200,4,15,New Cartman,"[a shadow falls on him] Oh, there you are. Alright, I got the goods. Some candy bars, a few donuts, and some beef gravy."
201,4,15,Eric Cartman,Is anyone starting to suspect anything?
202,4,15,New Cartman,Nobody. Your mom even thinks I'm a skinny you.
203,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Ahawesome! Alright, throw it over!"
204,4,15,New Cartman,Uh uh. One thing. I want a bigger cut.
205,4,15,Eric Cartman,What?!
206,4,15,New Cartman,"I'm the one risking my ass, running around in that stupid town pretending to be you and collecting all the food to bring up here! All you have to do is sit back and sell it to all the fat kids!"
207,4,15,Eric Cartman,Alright alright! Keep your voice down! I'll bump you up to 10%.
208,4,15,New Cartman,Twenty.
209,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[soft gasp] Suck my balls, 20!"
210,4,15,New Cartman,Fine! Then I shall bid you good day! [turns aside to get his bike]
211,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait! Fine, 20! But just remember that your parents think that you're in the drug rehab center next door! You blow your cover and we're both screwed! [the new Cartman looks trapped]"
212,4,15,Student 1,[bursts through the door] You guys! You have to check this tape out!
213,4,15,Student 2,"[on the sofa] Ey, we're trying to study. Finals are tomorrow."
214,4,15,Student 1,"No, dude, check this out! It's a video: this kid, he does all kinds of crazy stuff. [pops the video into the VCR and turns on the TV] Check it out! He jumped into a Porto-Potty at a construction site and stayed there for four days! [the screen shows Kenny standing in a pool of poo under the toilet and looking at the camera]"
215,4,15,Other Students,"Whoa! [the screen shows a construction worker heading for the Porto-Potty. He enters and sits on the toilet, and a long log of poo descends from his nether regions]"
216,4,15,Kenny McCormick,[the poo lands square on his face] (Ow.)

[four spotlights roam the stage] And now here's your host, the kid who will do anything to himself for money, Krrrra—a--a-a-azy Kenny! [Kenny appears and goes to the center of the stage, The spotlights converge on him as music reaches climax] Kenny, through the past weeks we've seen you eat mice, pretend to kill newborn babies to shock their mothers and ...wash your hair with battery acid. The question in all our minds is,  who-haht are you gonna do next? [the audience cheers]"
221,4,15,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, I'm gonna give my grandfather a full-body sensual massage.)"
222,4,15,Announcer,"Whoa-ho ho! You heard him, folks! Kenny is going to give a sensual full-body massage to his own grandfather!"

225,4,15,Audience,Awww! Awgh!
226,4,15,Stan Marsh,Wow! This is Kenny's best show ever!
227,4,15,New Cartman,"This is so juvenile. [bites a licorice stick. He has a box of donuts on his lap, and he and Kyle have licorice sticks]"
228,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell's the matter with you? [takes a donut]"
229,4,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, you've gotten lame since you got skinny. What's up?"
230,4,15,New Cartman,"Eh, nothing. Hey, can I have some of that licorice to- take home?"
231,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Alright campers, good work today. Lights out, and we'll see you tomorrow for more exercise and proper diet. [opens the door, exits, and closes the door]"
232,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"[waiting] All beddy-byes for the night, are they?"
233,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"I don't know what we're doing wrong, Susan. These kids aren't losing the weight."
234,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,We'll just have to give them more time. They'll do it!
235,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,They'll do it.
236,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"They'll do it!! [the counselors leave. Inside the cabin Cartman looks out the window, watching them leave]"
237,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Alright, they're gone! [walks to his bed and pulls out a suitcase from underneath] The Cartman store is open! [the other kids leave their bunks and head for Cartman]"
238,4,15,Blonde Girl,"[first in line, hands him some money] Two donuts and a pack of licorice, please."
239,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[quickly as he hands the goods over] Two donuts and a pack of licorice. [she walks away,and a big, tall boy is next] Well, Tony, the usual? [Tony, with squinty eyes, blinks and Cartman gives him the usual. Tony walks away. Another boy walks up, crying] Why are you crying, Chad?"
240,4,15,Chad,"[sobbing] 'Cause I'm always gonna be fat. I don't wanna eat no sweets, but I can't control myself when they're right in front of me like this. [sobs some more. Cartman moves away a bit] All my life I've been fat. I've beh- I've been to seven camps and I swore to my momma that I'd lose the weight. I want to, but I can't help myself. [breaks down]"
241,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[comforts Chad] Hey, Chad, eh... You know what you need? You need a friend."
242,4,15,Chad,"[wipes away his tears] I'd, I do?"
243,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Yes. [dangles a chocolate in front of him] A chocolate friend. [Chad begins to howl] Mr. Candy Bar doesn't judge you, Chad. Mr. Candy Bar likes you just the way you are. [opens the wrapper to expose the aroma and tempts him] Look at how yummy and sweet he is. [Chad, still sobbing, takes the candy bar and starts eating. Cartman bides his time] ...There you go. That'll just be four dollars. [Chad hands him the money and finishes the candy bar. Cartman just watches] ...There you go."
244,4,15,Announcer,"This week on Pay Per View [a yellow starburst appears with ""PAY PER VIEW"" on it, then another starburst with Kenny standing behind Ms. Crabtree], Krazy Kenny will crawl up into a woman's uterus and [a shot of Kenny inside the uterus] stay there for six hours.

248,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,[stammering] Wow!
249,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,"Now, some people that all you guys do is perform sick and disgusting acts for shock value and money, which makes you whores. But I'd like to prove them wrong. So what I'm gonna do... is I'm gonna offer each of you $50,000 to give me oral sex right now."
250,4,15,Tom Green,I'm in.

258,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,"Ooh, the kid says he'll do it for ten bucks."
259,4,15,Tom Green,Damnit. I'm out.
260,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,Me too. I guess he is the biggest whore.
261,4,15,Howard Stern and Johnny Knoxville,"Alright, let's get going, then. Can we cut the cameras?"
262,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,And we're gonna reach for the sky... [has arms high above his head]
263,4,15,Campers,[follow through] Woo-aagh.
264,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,And down to the ground. [touches the ground with his fingertips]
265,4,15,Campers,[follow through] Woo-ugh.
266,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,And up to the sky... [arms high above his head]
267,4,15,Campers,[follow through] Woo-aagh. [Cartman and the camper to his right perform a quick transaction - Cartman hands him a pastry for a few bucks.]
268,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,And down to the ground. [touches the ground with his fingertips]
269,4,15,Campers,"[follow through] Woo-ugh. [a couple enters the yard with their son, the taller camper Cartman got annoyed with early on. Susan catches up]"
270,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Please, Mr. Sanders. [Rick rises quickly]"
271,4,15,Mr Sanders,No! I have had it!
272,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,What's happening?
273,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Horace's parents want to take him home.
274,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Oh! But he's not ready yet.
275,4,15,Mr Sanders,"Look at what you've done to my boy! You told Horace that he was responsible for his weight! You made him believe that with exercise and proper diet, he could be thin! When we told you it was his genetics!"
276,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,They can lose the weight if they try.
277,4,15,Mr Sanders,Look at these kids! They're not getting any thinner! [a shot of the campers] Your camp is a fraud! You need to accept the fact that most fat people are just genetically fat!
278,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Please, sir, if you give us one more week,..."
279,4,15,Mr Sanders,Your time is up!
280,4,15,Mrs Sanders,"Yeah, your time is up!"
281,4,15,Mr Sanders,And I'm going to call all the other parents to tell them to come claim their kids as well! Your camp is a WASTE ...of time!
282,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony","But, Dad, I..."
283,4,15,Mr Sanders,"What?! [Horace looks at Cartman, who look back concerned]"
284,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony",...Nothin'. [he and his parents turn right and walk away]
285,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"We're in trouble, Rick."
286,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, Ms. Crabtree. Is it comf'table enough?"
287,4,15,Ms Crabtree,HOW LONG HAVE I GOT TO SIT HERE?
288,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Six hours.
289,4,15,Ms Crabtree,"HELL, I'LL DO SIX HOURS FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS YOU'RE PAYING ME!"
290,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Great.
291,4,15,Stan Marsh,[enters and runs to the stage] You guys! It's Kenny! He's been arrested for prostitution in New York!
292,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,For what?
293,4,15,Stan Marsh,For giving Howard Stern a hummer!
294,4,15,Butters Stotch,Who-what's a hummer??
295,4,15,Stan Marsh,I don't know! All I know is Kenny is in jail for at least three months!
296,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Three months?! But the pay-per-view is tomorrow!
297,4,15,Stan Marsh,"I know! [Kyle gets an idea. He and Stan descend the steps to talk to the new Cartman, who stands nearby]"
298,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"[sits next to the new Cartman. Stan sits by Kyle's other side] He worked so hard, come so close. Now we'll never see Kenny crawl up into Ms. Crabtree's uterus."
299,4,15,New Cartman,"You know, maybe we've all learned something here. I mean, we set Kenny up to further and further himself each time, havin' to always outdo himself. Now he's in jail for being a whore. And perhaps, just perhaps, we are to blame. [Kyle looks at him with suspicious anger]"
300,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"...Alright, that does it! [rises and backs up a bit] This has been bothering the hell out of me! [reaches for the new Cartman's cap and pulls it off, revealing a puffy head of hair. Stan registers shock] I knew it! You're not Cartman at all!"
301,4,15,New Cartman,Uh oh.
302,4,15,Announcer,"Well, we've seen him do just about every disgusting thing in the book, and today live on pay-per-view, Krazy Kenny is going to crawl into a woman's uterus for six hours! [the audience jumps and applauds] Well, Ms. Crabtree, your cervix has been dilated, your womb equipped with oxygen- How do you feel?"
303,4,15,Ms Crabtree,I feel great! I haven't had this much attention paid to my coot since I was 16!
304,4,15,Audience,"[jumping, cheering] Hooray!"
305,4,15,Announcer,"Well, let's bring out the man of the hour, you know him as the-"
306,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't worry, dude. You're gonna do great."
307,4,15,New Kenny,[pulls the hood off his face] No way! I'm not doing this!
308,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, you're doing it, or else we're gonna bust your whole scheme wide open, and tell your mom you haven't actually been at your drug rehab this whole time!"
309,4,15,New Kenny,But this isn't fair!
310,4,15,Stan Marsh,"[walks up and puts the hood back on the new Kenny] Deal, druggie!"
311,4,15,New Kenny,(But I'm gonna starve to death if I get in there!)
312,4,15,Announcer,"And here he is, Kenny McCormick! [Kenny enters, waves to the audience as it cheers, and walks towards Ms. Crabtree. Kenny parts the little curtains and the audience quiets down. The audience reacts as Kenny climbs into the uterus] We can watch him on the video monitors. How are you doin' in there, Kenny? [four monitors frame the stage prop behind Ms. Crabtree. Above her is a digital timer. Inside the womb, Kenny holds his right thumb up]"
313,4,15,Mrs McCormick,That's my boy! [Stuart smiles]
314,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Good-bye, Chad."
315,4,15,Chad s Dad,"We'll be wanting our refund, naturally."
316,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Naturally.
317,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Good-bye, Alice."
318,4,15,Alice,Good-bye. Thank you.
319,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Oh, don't thank us. We failed you."
320,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[off to one side] ...65, 66, 67... [counting the dollars he's collected during his stay]"
321,4,15,Chad,"[at the back door of the car, turns around] Wait a second! This isn't right! [other campers and their parents stop] It's time for me to be responsible for my own actions! Mom, Dad, we've been eating candy this whole time! Eric Cartman's been sneaking in junk food!"
322,4,15,Eric Cartman,"[through gritted teeth] Eh- shut up, you half-Chad!"
323,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony","No, he's right. The counselors've been doing a good job. We've just been cheating."
324,4,15,Other campers,Yeah.
325,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony",I believe I can lose the weight with exercise and proper diet. I don't wanna make excuses no more.
326,4,15,Girl,Me neither.
327,4,15,Other campers,"Yeah. [newly overjoyed, Rick and Susan grin and look at each other]"
328,4,15,"Fat kids, including Horace Sanders, Chad, and Tony","If you take us back, we promise we won't cheat."
329,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Well, it's alright with me. Parents?"
330,4,15,Mr Sanders,"Well, what the heck. Maybe when you're all done you can teach me a thing or two, huh son? [rubs his son's hair; Horace looks up and grins at him]"
331,4,15,Eric Cartman,"You know? You guys are right. I'm sick of being the fat kid, too. I've been making excuses all my life. But I know deep down that if I took responsibility and really tried hard, and we all tried together, well we really can lose the weight! [grins hopefully]"
332,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,"Oh no, not you. You're not welcome here anymore."
333,4,15,Campers,Yeah.
334,4,15,Eric Cartman,What?!
335,4,15,Camp Counselors Rick and Susan,Bubbye. [turns around and walks into the registration building with Susan. The rest of the campers follow them in.]
336,4,15,Eric Cartman,"Well, screw you, fatasses! [begins sobbing, and pulls out a donut from his pocket. He eats at it between sobs.]"
337,4,15,Audience,"Four, three, two, one!"
338,4,15,Announcer,"He did it! Come on out, Kenny! [nothing happens] You made it six hours, Kenny. Come on out of there. [nothing] Hmmm. Uh, Ms. Crabtree, maybe you could give him a little push. [Ms. Crabtree breathes in and pushes down. The new Kenny comes out of the uterus and slides down the steps of the stage]"
339,4,15,Audience,OOOOHHHHHH!
340,4,15,Dr Doctor,He's dead. The pressure must have killed him.
341,4,15,Ms Crabtree,I told you I was a tight virgin flower.
342,4,15,Stan Marsh,"[pointing] Oh my God, they've killed Kenny! ...Sort of."
343,4,15,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. They've kinda killed Kenny -'s look-alike. You bastards!
344,4,15,Announcer,"Well, he gave his life for our amusement. One little boy who dared to be different. Let us never forget... Kenny McCormick. [Ms. Crabtree pushes down and another boy, wearing glasses, descends] Who was that?"
