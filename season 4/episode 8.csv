0,4,8,Announcer,"Tonight, Stellar Productions presents the boy band of the decade! [women scream, jump, and shout. Signs saying, ""FINGERBANG RULES"" ""FINGER BANG"" ""WE LOVE FINGER BANG"" AND ""FINGER BANG 4EVER"" bob throughout the audience] It's Fingerbang, live from Madison Square Gardens! [the interior is shown, with cheering crowds. A heralding sound effect plays, and spotlights flicker around the stage. A burst of fireworks cues the music and the familiar silhouettes of four boys are shown on stage. A few women faint]"
1,4,8,Fingerbang,"[the lights go on them, and it's the boys, dressed in white outfits. Their hats are all white, too. A green shirt indicates Kyle, a blue one Stan. Kenny wears an orange visor over his white hood. All wear headsets]
Fingerbang!
[they each spin towards the audience once, then stop]
Bang-bang!
Fingerbang-bang!
[they spin back to their first positions]
Bangbangbang!
[all step forward and do their routine]
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you ever-y night"
2,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[steps forward for a solo bridge as the others sway back and forth]
And girl, you know that you're the only girl for me, girl
Girl, you're the girl of my fantasy
You're my girl, you're my girl"
3,4,8,Woman,"[as Cartman sings] Cartman, I want youuu!"
4,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[continues] My... girrrrrrrl... [lifts up his shirt to show off the right breast—um, pec. The others turn to their right while maintaining their gaze and pointing their gun fingers at the audience. The music builds as women scream at the sight]"
5,4,8,Fingerbang,"[Cartman rejoins the others and all point their gun fingers at the audience, then resume the routine]
Fingerbang!
Bang... Bang bang bang
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang!
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang--"
6,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Yes! I'm a star! I'm a star! I'm-- [wakes up, then looks angry] Aaawww, I'm nobody! God-dammit! [suddenly thinks] Wait a minute. Maybe that was a sign from God. That's it, isn't it? You want me to start a boy band so I can make $10 million dollars, don't you? That's it! [rushes out of bed]"
7,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[pacing back and forth] Gentlemen, thank you for coming. This is the beginning of a great time in our lives. [stops and faces them] God has finally spoken to me, you guys. And he has told me how I can make $10 million dollars."
8,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,...How?
9,4,8,Eric Cartman,Boy band.
10,4,8,Stan Marsh,Boy band?
11,4,8,Eric Cartman,Boy band.
12,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not being in any [crosses his arms over his chest] faggy boy band!
13,4,8,Eric Cartman,"There's nothing faggy about $10 million dollars, asshole! This was a message from God!"
14,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we don't have any musical talent."
15,4,8,Eric Cartman,"That didn't stop any of the other boy bands, dumbass! [pulls out a tape from his back pocket] I've got prerecorded music we can sing to, just like they do. All we need to do is practice our choreography over and over and over!"
16,4,8,Kenny McCormick,(That sounds totally fuckin' stupid.)
17,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Kenny. And then, I know I can get us a gig at the South Park Mall. [intense] So everybody get in a straight line, we're gonna listen to a song from the top, and take it--"
18,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wait a minute. There's only four of us.
19,4,8,Eric Cartman,So?
20,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"So, all boy bands have five members."
21,4,8,Eric Cartman,What?
22,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, New Kids on the Block. All had five members."
23,4,8,Stan Marsh,He's right.
24,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[throws down the tape] Dammit! Okay, okay okayokayokay. We'll put off practice for now, and hold auditions for a fifth member. Get the word out that auditions will be tomorrow morning!"
25,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"Did you have fun at Eric's house today, Stanley?"
26,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, I guess."
27,4,8,Sharon Marsh,What did you do?
28,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, Cartman wants to start a boy band, so we're gonna rehearse and then try to perform at the South Park Mall. [Randy reacts, and Shelly takes notice]"
29,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh well, that sounds nice."
30,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[to Sharon, angrily] No, it does NOT  sound nice! [to Stan] Stanley, you are gonna have no part in that boy band."
31,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well but, Dad, all my friends are doing it."
32,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[rises] If all your friends jumped off a cliff, [jabs his finger at Stan] would you do that too?"
33,4,8,Stan Marsh,[voice shaking] Cartman says we can make $10 million dollars.
34,4,8,Randy Marsh,"You are not gonna be in a boy band, Stanley! AND THAT IS FINAL! [storms out]"
35,4,8,Shelly Marsh,"Geez, what's up Dad's ass?"
36,4,8,Butters Stotch,"[holds two fingers on his right hand up to indicate a hopping bunny]
Little Bunny Foo-Foo hoppin' through the forest
[scoops up imaginary mice, makes two fists, and bops the right one with the left]
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head
[shimmies down with hands outstretched. The auditors look half-asleep]
Down came a white angel and she said
[the angel (left finger) reprimands the bunny]
""Little Bunny Foo-Foo, I don't wanna see you
[the piano player seems familiar. The angle bops the bunny]
Scoopin' up the field mice and boppin' 'em on the head""
So now I'm gonna turn you into a worm, mbuh, mBunny Foo-Foo... Eh, beh-POOF
[slaps his right hand with his left, and one finger goes down, leaving a worm]
Little Wormy Foo-Foo crawlin' through the forest
Gettin scooped up by the field mice who mah-m then they bopped 'im on the head
[grins, then does a little kick forward]"
37,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[through the mic] Eheh, thank you Butters. We'll let you know."
38,4,8,Butters Stotch,"Ah, I can do it again."
39,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[through the mic] We'll let you know, Butters."
40,4,8,Butters Stotch,"Ahah-oo well, alright then. [walks off to his left, unsure]"
41,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Pffft! Oh my God, his intonation was so off!"
42,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,It was?
43,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't think I could sing any better than that."
44,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Guys, if we're gonna impress the mall owner and get that gig, we'd better</> do it better than that. [into the mic] Next!"
45,4,8,Stan Marsh,"[reads from a list] Uhhh, next is Ike Broflovski."
46,4,8,Eric Cartman,Kyle's brother?
47,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,I promised my mom I'd let him try. [Ike hops in with some sheet music]
48,4,8,Eric Cartman,Christ's sake..!
49,4,8,Schroeder,What key?
50,4,8,Ike,"[hands him the sheet]
G.
[hops back to the sofa as the kid plays]
Itsy bitsy spider, out the water spout--"
51,4,8,Eric Cartman,[through the mic] Next!
52,4,8,Ike,"Oh Danny Boy, the parson's calling 
Clang, clang and clang"
53,4,8,Eric Cartman,[through the mic] Next audition!
54,4,8,Ike,"E F G, H I J K L-M-N-O-P"
55,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[through the mic] Goddammit, NEXT!"
56,4,8,Ike,"When ah thanky you be 
One on a teacher on a palm tree"
57,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[through the mic] Not the next song, the next PERSON! [Ike goes for his sheet music, then returns to flip Cartman off.] Aw, man, this is gonna be a long-ass day. [the front door opens and in walks Wendy with her sheet music. She walks to the piano player, gives it to him--]"
58,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh no! Nononononono! Sorry, Wendy, this tryouts for a boy band! [a grinning Wendy suddenly frowns and her head hangs.]"
59,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come on, dude. Let her try."
60,4,8,Eric Cartman,[moves the mic away] No way!
61,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Cartman! You haven't liked anybody else!"
62,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Okayokay, fine. Wow me."
63,4,8,Wendy Testaburger,"[cues the player]

[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny applaud]"
64,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, Wendy. Don't call us. We won't call you either, heheh. [Wendy is angered]"
65,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what are you talkin' about? That was awesome!"
66,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, she's a chick!"
67,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, nobody's gonna notice."
68,4,8,Eric Cartman,"""Nobody's gonna notice""?! What about her huge freakin' hooters, huh?! [Wendy looks down at her chest]"
69,4,8,Stan Marsh,She's the best chance we have! I say she's in.
70,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
71,4,8,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
72,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, this is a democratic boy band, is it? Alright, fine! She's in until she screws up!"
73,4,8,Wendy Testaburger,[exults] Yeah!
74,4,8,Eric Cartman,Okaaay! You guys all ready to rehearse?
75,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, it's six in the morning. Do we have to rehearse this early?"
76,4,8,Eric Cartman,"We have to rehearse all that we can! [moves away] Now, check this out: [returns with a box of clothes and sets it on the floor] My mom made us costumes!"
77,4,8,Stan Marsh,Costumes? [the band gathers around the box]
78,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. [starts handing out the costumes] This one's yours, Stan. This one is Kyle's. This one will cover up Wendy's hooters... [she looks a little embarrassed]"
79,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman, how come your costume has like, nose rings and facial hair?"
80,4,8,Eric Cartman,"'Cause I'm like, you know, the tough one. Every boy band has to have the one member that, you know, is tough."
81,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,[dryly] I wanna be the tough one.
82,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[looks back blankly] ...Kyle, you are the sweet one. Will you please just cooperate and not--"
83,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,[determined] I wanna be the tough one!
84,4,8,Eric Cartman,"You can't be the tough one, you're Jewish!"
85,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Jews are tough!
86,4,8,Eric Cartman,Since when?!
87,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Since Abraham, fatass!"
88,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, fine! Here! [tosses the tough costume at Kyle, knocking him down] Jesus Christ, I wonder if every boy band has to go through this! [moves away. The band dresses. Kenny is a baseball player, Stan is a fighter pilot, Cartman is an Elvis impersonator, Kyle is a tough dude with nose ring and Fu Manchu mustache]"
89,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, anyways?"
90,4,8,Eric Cartman,"I heard it on HBO. It means, like, you know, when you... [waves his finger around] pretend to use your finger like a gun or something."
91,4,8,Kenny McCormick,"[chuckling] (Hm hm, noho, that's not what it means.)"
92,4,8,Stan Marsh,Kenny says that's not what it means.
93,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[testy] Okay, Kenny, what does ""fingerbang"" mean, then?"
94,4,8,Kenny McCormick,"(It's when you take your finger, and you stick it in a vagina and you stick it in again and again.)"
95,4,8,Eric Cartman,"...What?! Who the hell would do that?! Jesus Christ! Grow up Kenny, would you?! Alright, boys, let's do it from the top. 1, 2, 3, 4!"
96,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"[with a drawl] Now, I know that this is your first day on the job of mall security, rookie. Keepin' the law in a mall is just like any tough city, and especially because they don't let us have guns. It can be very dangerous."
97,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[leading the band members through the mall] Alright, guys. Let's do it like we rehearsed! We need energy! We need to be up!"
98,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"[blocking the way to Mall Management] Excuse me, just where do you think you're goin'?"
99,4,8,Eric Cartman,We're goin' to see the mall manager.
100,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,Do you have the proper clearance?
101,4,8,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Uh oh, mall cops."
102,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"You have to make an appointment first. Now move along, sir."
103,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[pleading] But we practiced for days. All we want to do is show the guy what we can do, [the veteran guard pulls out a small bottle of pepper spray and shakes it up] so that maybe we'll have a chance to perform in the plaza of the--  [the veteran guard sprays his face all over] Aagh! Aagh! Ooww! Ow! Oh! God-dammit..! [squeezes his eyes shut and rubs them]"
104,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Jesus Christ!
105,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God, I can't see! [rubs his eyes]"
106,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Move along, sir. Or I'll do it again. [Cartman walks off and the others join him. Stan retrieves the boom box. Then] You see, you put your life on the line every day."
107,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, I guess we can't get in to see the mall manager."
108,4,8,Eric Cartman,[coughs a few times] The hell we can't! I'm not lettin' no washed-up law cops ruin my divine quest! Come on! [all join him down the mall]
109,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,Ey! [the man turns to look at him] What are you doin'?
110,4,8,Man,Nothin'. Just... shopping.
111,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Move along, sir. [the man leaves and the veteran looks at the rookie] You see, sometimes you gotta just do that. Keeps shoppers on their toes — try it. [the rookie gets determined and a woman and girl walk by]"
112,4,8,Rookie Security Guard,Ey! [they turn to look at him] What are you doin'?
113,4,8,Woman,Nothing. Why?
114,4,8,Rookie Security Guard,"Move along, ma'am. [she leaves looking angry]"
115,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,That's what being a mall cop is all about. Hyeuup.
116,4,8,Rookie Security Guard,Cool.
117,4,8,Eric Cartman,[over the PA system] Attention mall shoppers: the next twenty people to buy an orange smoothie will also receive a complimentary Nissan Sentra. Hurry up. [crowds rush off to get their Nissans]
118,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Jesus, they're gonna start a riot! [both cops follow the crowd while Cartman and friends return to the mall manager's office]"
119,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, guys, here we go. [enters the office with the others] Hello, sir!"
120,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"[a harried man who's speech is nearly emotionless with odd exclamations] What? Hey. Who are you? [the office is a bit unkempt. Stacks of paper here and there, hanging out of cabinet drawers, scraps on the floor and desk...]"
121,4,8,Eric Cartman,We... are Fingerbang!
122,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,O-o-oh. What? How'd you get in here? Hey.
123,4,8,Eric Cartman,We would like to audition for you for a gig in the central plaza of your fine mall.
124,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,What? O-oh. You wanna play at the mall? Like Tiffany?
125,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Sort of like Tiffany, yes. Can we audition?"
126,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Oh. Well, I guess. ...What?"
127,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright! Let's do it, boys! [moves aside and sets the boom box down, then sets the tape to play. He returns to the group, and they begin. All of them are all off-key, They all sing too ahead of the music and Wendy's voice is squeaky and lags behind the others...]"
128,4,8,Fingerbang,"I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
I'm goin' to fingerbang-bang you ever-y night"
129,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[goes into his solo, and back into his dream]
And girl you know you're cool, you're good, you're so much nicer, girl
You're good, You're gonna be--"
130,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"[cuts him off] Alright, that's enough!"
131,4,8,Eric Cartman,"--you're my fantasy, you fanta--"
132,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Thank you.
133,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[backs up into the band] Well, so can we play here?"
134,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,What?? ...No.
135,4,8,Eric Cartman,No??
136,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Who?? No!
137,4,8,Eric Cartman,Why not?!
138,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Well uh, uh, oh... Right now there's a cheese and sausage cart in the plaza. And I would uh, I'd hate to have to move it off to the side for a while. What?"
139,4,8,Eric Cartman,"You don't think we're any good, do you?!"
140,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"No. I mean, you're just not as good as sausage and cheese."
141,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, come on guys. We gave it our best. [goes to get his boom box]"
142,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Wow. That was your best? [Cartman flashes an angry look at him, then walks off in a huff.]"
143,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. I feel so rejected.
144,4,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
145,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,There you are! You're the hoodlums who got on the intercom and started an orange smoothie riot!
146,4,8,Stan Marsh,Uh-oh.
147,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,I will now read you your mall rights! You have the right to shop at a variety of malls in all--
148,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Run for it! [the five bolt and rush out of there]
149,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Go get 'em, rookie! [gives the rookie a stern look; the rookie just looks back]"
150,4,8,Randy Marsh,Where is Stan?
151,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, he's over at Eric's house practicing for his boy band."
152,4,8,Randy Marsh,What?! I specifically told him not to do that!
153,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Randy, calm down. It's just a silly little dream. They're not gonna actually make it."
154,4,8,Randy Marsh,"And what if they do make it, Sharon? What if they do make it? Are you gonna be the one to tell 'im?! [turns around and walks out]"
155,4,8,Shelly Marsh,"Mom, what's up Dad's ass?"
156,4,8,Sharon Marsh,"It's a long story, Shelly. Let's just say your father... has a lot up his ass right now."
157,4,8,Chef,"[opens the door and appears in a towel around his waist] Oh! Oh-h, hello Eric."
158,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[eyes downcast] Problem, Chef. I have m-many problems."
159,4,8,Chef,"Wellll, if you uhhh, come back in just a little bit, Eric, I'll see if I can help you out. [a blonde woman comes up behind Chef]"
160,4,8,Eric Cartman,I just don't know what I'm gonna do. [lets himself in] Sometimes I wonder if God isn't toying with me. [goes to the sofa and pulls out some Cheesy Poofs to eat]
161,4,8,Chef,"[sits next to Cartman] Alright, Eric, what's the matter?"
162,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Chef, God told me I was to start a boy band and make $10 million dollars. The problem is, it isn't working. I mean, [with feeling] I feel the music burning inside me. But I just can't express it right, you know? [the woman sits on Chef's left side and strokes his arm]"
163,4,8,Chef,"Well, Eric, I, I think you were just focusin' in on the wrong thing. Boy bands aren't about music, boy bands are created by corporations to make money. They're all based on the Gomlich effect."
164,4,8,Eric Cartman,What's the Gomlich effect?
165,4,8,Chef,"The law of physics that states, ""If one girl screams for something, it will make other girls scream. And then, it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming."""
166,4,8,Eric Cartman,So how do boy bands use that?
167,4,8,Chef,"All they do is make videos, showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band. Once you get girls screaming, you can't stop 'em. They're crazy! [the blonde gets cross and scoots away; Chef quickly makes amends] Uh-uh, except for Lilian, of course. [she goes sweet on him again]"
168,4,8,Eric Cartman,Thanks!
169,4,8,Chef,"You're welcome. Now, go away!"
170,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay. [Chef watches as Cartman drops down and heads for the front door, exits...]"
171,4,8,Chef,A-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either!
172,4,8,Eric Cartman,[outside] Cucumber in the pants. Got it. [and closes the door]
173,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, everybody, listen up! This is how this first shot is gonna work: The girls are standing here, and then the members of the band walk by looking cool. When you see us, you girls all scream like, ""Oh my God, it's Fingerbang! Oh my God!"" Okay?"
174,4,8,Bebe Stevens and other girls,"Are we gonna get paid now, or after?"
175,4,8,Eric Cartman,"I'll pay you afterwards. Promise. Okay, Timmy, roll camera. [Timmy sits in the cameraman's chair]"
176,4,8,Timmy Burch,Tiimmmaaayyy! [Cartman inches his way to the group sideways]
177,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what's wrong with your leg?"
178,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Oh, Chef says to put a cucumber down my pants for good luck. [the band walks across the ground in front of the girls]"
179,4,8,Girls,[ad lib] Ahhh. Wow. Woohoo. Yay.
180,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Waitwaitwaitwait, cut!"
181,4,8,Timmy Burch,Huhaaaaah!
182,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Let's go crazier than that! I mean, you have to act like it's freakin' Leonardo DiCaprio!"
183,4,8,Bebe Stevens and other girls,We wouldn't give a rat's ass if Leonardo DiCaprio came walking past us.
184,4,8,Other Girls Red,Yeah.
185,4,8,Annie,Yeah.
186,4,8,and Milly,Yeah.
187,4,8,Eric Cartman,Fine! Who would you go crazy for?
188,4,8,Girls,...Matt Lauer.
189,4,8,Eric Cartman,"...Okay, fine! Pretend that we're Matt Lauer."
190,4,8,Bebe Stevens and other girls,Oh... Okay. [Cartman positions himself in front of them]
191,4,8,Eric Cartman,Roll camera!
192,4,8,Timmy Burch,Timmuh! [the band tries again]
193,4,8,Girls,"AAAGGGGHHH! [the band scatters away from the screaming. Cartman falls, then gets up]"
194,4,8,Eric Cartman,Jesus Christ!
195,4,8,Fingerbang,Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
196,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Aaand cut! [music stops] Alright, our video's complete. Through the grace of God I can now go back to that mall manager and show him what we've got!"
197,4,8,Bebe Stevens and other girls,"Okay, so where's our money?"
198,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh uh, Kyle has it. [the girls move to Kyle. Cartman walks away]"
199,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[arrives] Stanley, what the hell are you doing?"
200,4,8,Stan Marsh,We are making a music video.
201,4,8,Randy Marsh,You get in the truck right now! [points at it]
202,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I was just a--"
203,4,8,Randy Marsh,[pointing] Get in the truck! [Stan walks to the truck dejected]
204,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I did all my chores. Why can't I play with my friends?"
205,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, it's just that there's better things you could be doing on a Saturday than singing and dancing. You could be watching TV or, laying in bed."
206,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I like being in a boy band. I think it's interesting."
207,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, there's plenty of other interesting you can do. Have you ever tried marijuana?"
208,4,8,Stan Marsh,No.
209,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, maybe it's time."
210,4,8,Stan Marsh,Dad!
211,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,Ey! What are you doin'?
212,4,8,Madman,I've got a new strain of anthrax that I will soon unleash upon all of North America!
213,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Move along, sir."
214,4,8,Madman,Wuh? [walks away]
215,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Attention, shoppers: There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. There are naked people at the orange smoothie machine. [crowds of mall shoppers head for the orange smoothie machine]"
216,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,God dammit! [he and the rookie give chase]
217,4,8,Eric Cartman,[enters the manager's office] Hello again!
218,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,What? Oh. It's you. I don't like you.
219,4,8,Eric Cartman,I know you didn't love our audition. But now we have a video.
220,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Oh. What?
221,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[retrieves a TV cart with VCR and pops the VCR in. The video pops up] If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! [at first, only the boys' hats are seen, near the play elephants. The camera spins right, then down, and the girls' feet are seen. The camera spins up and left, and finally rests on Timmy]"
222,4,8,Timmy Burch,"Timmiihh! [The camera turns left again and catches a glimpse of the girls, then ends up on Cartman, and zooms in on the cucumber]"
223,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, god dammit..! Our camera guy kinda sucks, but this next shot we did was really cool. [the camera gets a glimpse of the four girls, then moves off them a second after Cartman appears]"
224,4,8,Timmy Burch,"Haaghh. [waves at the camera, then moves his wheelchair back and dances to the music] Timmih, livin' a lie!"
225,4,8,Eric Cartman,Son of a bitch!
226,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Hey. This video is dumb.
227,4,8,Eric Cartman,[dead air on tape] You don't understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do. Ple-ease.
228,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Alright alright. What? Well, I guess I can move the sausage and cheese cart off to one side. [gives a warning face] For a little while."
229,4,8,Eric Cartman,Really? You will?
230,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Only for twenty minutes, though."
231,4,8,Eric Cartman,That's all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o'clock?
232,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Oh. Okay. [static shows up on the video]
233,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Thank you sir, you will not be disappointed! [a previous recording is shown:]"
234,4,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh, Mrs. Cartman, I've been uh very bad. M'kay? [he's handcuffed against a brick wall. Mrs. Cartman appears as a dominatrix]"
235,4,8,Liane Cartman,"You have been bad, so you're gonna have to drink from this glass. [points to it, then spreads her legs and pisses into it as he watches]"
236,4,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh, yeah, that makes me hot, m'kay? [Cartman is shocked at what he sees; the manager is pleased]"
237,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw, Mom!"
238,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Wow. What?
239,4,8,Stan Marsh,"It's not fair, Dad! Why can't I be in a boy band?"
240,4,8,Randy Marsh,Because I said so!
241,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, Cartman said we're gonna perform at the mall at 3 o'clock. My friends are gonna be pissed off at me."
242,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Let 'em be pissed off, then!"
243,4,8,Stan Marsh,"I don't understand! Just let me go do this one thing, and I won't ever--"
244,4,8,Randy Marsh,"No!! [walks over to the china cabinet] NOOO!! [smashes his head through its glass doors, causing the dishes to slide out and break up. Stan is distraught, and Randy stands up, ashamed and shocked at his behavior. He walks back to Stan, then turns away defeated]"
245,4,8,Stan Marsh,Dad? What the hell is going on?
246,4,8,Randy Marsh,"...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men's choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver. [a flashback starts. A young Randy is at lower left corner of the choir, and the choir begins this song: ""Everything will wait / Weave all ye little reins...""] I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. [the audience claps. The producer is in the second row of spectators. The choir members split up and the producer rushes up to Randy]"
247,4,8,Producer,"Kid, can I talk to you?"
248,4,8,Randy Marsh,Uh sure.
249,4,8,Producer,"Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town."
250,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Ohh, thanks."
251,4,8,Producer,Listen: I'm putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.
252,4,8,Randy Marsh,What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?
253,4,8,Producer,"Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?"
254,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Oh my God, I don't know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--"
255,4,8,Producer,"Hey, look, if you don't want it, I'll keep looking--"
256,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[interrupting] No! Wait. I mean, ah-I'll think about it."
257,4,8,Producer,I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. [slips a business card into Randy's coat pocket and pats it]
258,4,8,Randy Marsh,And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...
259,4,8,Randy Marsh,[walks by Denver High] See ya. [walks away]
260,4,8,Randy Marsh,...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...
261,4,8,Randy Marsh,"See ya. [waves, turns and walks away, leaving a distraught girl with mouth open]"
262,4,8,Randy Marsh,...And I left my family.
263,4,8,Randy Marsh,"See ya. [gets into his beat-up pale-yellow car and drives off, leaving his parents at the front door]"
264,4,8,Randy Marsh,"And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn't even know. [the five are recording their first song]"
265,4,8,Producer,Take 112!
266,4,8,Ghetto Avenue Boys,"You've... got... it!
You know you've got... it
[Randy: Girl]
What you've got is it!"
267,4,8,Randy Marsh,"It's obvious to me, girl"
268,4,8,Randy Marsh,"The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. [the song continues as he speaks, and the scene changes from the studio, to a poster, to a concert as the camera leaves the poster]"
269,4,8,Ghetto Avenue Boys,"Shirl! You've... got... it!
It... is what you've got, girl!
What you've got is it!"
270,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Now, give it to me, 'cause..."
271,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[more scenes from his glory days] I had everything. A huge house, [the backyard pool: he's resting on an inflatable chaise longue while women surround him] and all the women you can imagine. [nine bikini-clad women are in his bed, and he's rolling back and forth over all of them] And then one day, just as quick as it started..."
272,4,8,Mr Allens,"[the Ghetto Avenue Boys enter to rehearse, but...] Alright, guys, let's take it from the top."
273,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Mr. Allens."
274,4,8,Mr Allens,Heh? Woh. Uh... R-Randy.
275,4,8,Randy Marsh,Who are they? [five new guys are in the recording booth]
276,4,8,Mr Allens,"These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... new boy band."
277,4,8,Randy Marsh,"But, w-we're still selling records, right?"
278,4,8,Mr Allens,"Look, kid, you're just getting a little... old to be in a boy band."
279,4,8,Randy Marsh,I'm 19.
280,4,8,Mr Allens,"Get a life, Marsh! [the Ghetto Avenue Boys turn around and walk out the door] Alright, guys, let's take it from the top."
281,4,8,Randy Marsh,"They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car..."
282,4,8,Tow Truck Driver,"[wearing a ""Tacos"" hat] See ya. [tows a blue sports car away]"
283,4,8,Randy Marsh,...the women all left...
284,4,8,Women,See ya. [the women pour out of bed and leave]
285,4,8,Randy Marsh,...and they took back my house.
286,4,8,Randy Marsh,[gets kicked out of the house] Ugh..! [the producer stands at the French doors]
287,4,8,Mr Allens,See ya. [Randy gets up and walks away]
288,4,8,Randy Marsh,"The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned."
289,4,8,Woman,"Hey! Weren't you the guy in that stupid boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?"
290,4,8,Man,"Sure, I remember you! [starts mocking] You got it, baby... You got it, baby [he and the others begin to laugh, and it soon gets overwhelming. Randy looks around, scared. The flashback ends]"
291,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[voice full of emotion] And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I'm talking about."
292,4,8,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.
293,4,8,Randy Marsh,"I didn't want you to know. Because now I'm a joke. Ever since then, I've wished every single day that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, ""No!"" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world. [Stan is listening] That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley. [bitterness creeps in] It's people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night's pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We're all the same. And that... is why you can't go to the mall. [walks off]"
294,4,8,Stan Marsh,[left with his thoughts] ...Oh-kay.
295,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. [the band regroups]
296,4,8,Eric Cartman,Where the hell is Stan?!
297,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,He'll be here. Stan wouldn't douche.
298,4,8,Eric Cartman,"I swear to God, if he ruins this dream of mine I will have his nuts!"
299,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"[approaches] Hey. Uh, are you gonna do that thing or what?"
300,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Yes, sir, any second—we're just waiting on one more member."
301,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Well hurry up. I can't keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. [the cart is shown with Swiss cheese and sausage, and a pissed-off vendor]"
302,4,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah. We'll start right away. [the manager walks away. Cartman turns to Kyle] We'll have to do it without him.
303,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Hell no! I'm not being part of a four-member boy band! We'll look stupid!
304,4,8,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
305,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, god-dammit!"
306,4,8,Stan Marsh,[enters] Dad?
307,4,8,Randy Marsh,Huh? Yeah?
308,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Well... I just wanted to tell you... that I don't think you're a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you're just my dad. And you're the best dad I've ever had."
309,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[thinks, then lowers the magazine] Come here, Stanley. [Stan approaches and sits next to his dad] Stan, it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why. I've made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes."
310,4,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
311,4,8,Randy Marsh,"You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn't that stupid?"
312,4,8,Stan Marsh,Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you've done.
313,4,8,Randy Marsh,"Well, come on. I'll drive you down to the mall."
314,4,8,Stan Marsh,Really?
315,4,8,Randy Marsh,Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we'll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.
316,4,8,Stan Marsh,Alright! [father and son get up and leave the bedroom. Randy tosses his magazine aside]
317,4,8,Man,What's happening here?
318,4,8,Woman,"I don't know, uh. I guess nothing."
319,4,8,Man,"Hm... Well, let's just walk away then. [man and woman leave]"
320,4,8,Eric Cartman,God dammit! People are walking away! [drops back behind the curtain]
321,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"[arrives again] Alright, kids, uh, that does it. You're gonna have to move and make way for the sausage and cheese cart."
322,4,8,Eric Cartman,Just another minute.
323,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,Sorry. Get out! [the band members walk sullenly away]
324,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[stops and looks up] Well God, I guess you got me again, didn't you? Hyeah, that was a good one, God. Hope it made you laugh, you sick bastard."
325,4,8,Wendy Testaburger,[rushes up to Cartman and points] What's that? [a grinning Randy and Stan arrive in an elevator]
326,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,It's Stan! [the other members have returned]
327,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, thank you God! Oh, praise his name! [walks off smiling as Stan arrives]"
328,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where the hell have you been?!"
329,4,8,Eric Cartman,"[approaches the manager] Sir! We're all here now! Can we go on, please?"
330,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Who? Well. Okay, I guess. But hurry up."
331,4,8,Eric Cartman,"We will! [moves to the front of the stage and addresses the audience] Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness the next great boy band of the country! Someday you will all be among those who can say, ""I saw Fingerbang when they first performed at some crappy little mall."" [the manager takes offense] And so, without further ado, all five members of the..."
332,4,8,Kenny McCormick,"[while Cartman talks] (Uff--!) [an elevator crushes him and Cartman stops. Everyone around, including Cartman, is stunned. The doors open and the occupants exit]"
333,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
334,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
335,4,8,Eric Cartman,[traumatized] No! He can't be dead!
336,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, he's pretty dead."
337,4,8,Eric Cartman,No! We were so close!
338,4,8,Harried Mall Manager,"Alright, that's it, kids. Get out!"
339,4,8,Eric Cartman,But we have to perform!
340,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't have a fifth member, Cartman!"
341,4,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yes we do."
342,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Thank you all for your patience, and now get ready for Fingerbang!"
343,4,8,Fingerbang,"[the new fifth member: Randy]
Fingerbang!
Bang bang [audience members look at each other]
Fingerbang-bang!
Bangbangbang [people begin to leave]
I'm gonna fingerbang-bang you into my life
Girl, you like to fingerbang, and it's alright
[Janitors wearing face masks scrape Kenny's remains off the elevator]
'Cause I'm the king of fingerbang; let's not fight
[the veteran mall guard swivels his hips around happily as the rookie looks on]
I'm goin' tuh fingerbang-bang you ever-y night
[Cartman: I'll just...]
Fingerbang-bang you ever-y night!"
344,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Chuh! [only four shoppers remain to clap for them] Yes! Yes! Thank you, yes!"
345,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,We made two dollars.
346,4,8,Stan Marsh,"You were great, Dad."
347,4,8,Randy Marsh,Yeah. I guess I still got it in me a little.
348,4,8,Little Girl,Can I get your autograph?
349,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Ok-Okay, okay."
350,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"[arrives with the rookie and moves the girl aside] Hey, don't hassle the talent, ma'am."
351,4,8,Little Girl,"[looks at the guard] I actually don't really know who they are, I was just getting an autograph and-- [the veteran guard sprays her with pepper] A-a-agg-g-ggh!"
352,4,8,Veteran Security Guard,"Move along, ma'am. [the little girl runs off stage] Eh, that was pretty good, kids. Maybe you can come perform at my Elks Club sometime."
353,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, yeah, maybe. [the mall cops walk away] God..! Now it's like everybody wants a piece of us."
354,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
355,4,8,Eric Cartman,"I don't know if I can handle all this fame. I mean, I always thought I'd wanna become famous, but now that I am, I don't know if I like it. I mean, I probably can't even walk through this mall right now without people goin', ""Oh my God, it's the Fingerbang guy! Oh my God!"""
356,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,...Yeah. That's gonna suck.
357,4,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I just wanna be a normal kid again. Have a normal life and appreciate what I have.
358,4,8,Randy Marsh,"[looks at Stan and pats him on the back] Well, I think you boys are very smart for your age. Come on. I'll buy you all an orange smoothie. [gets up and moves off the stage]"
359,4,8,Stan Marsh,I don't think they sell those anymore. [gets up and follows his dad off; Wendy gets up and follows him]
360,4,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Cartman, do you think God's getting mad at you for not making $10 million? [gets up and follows the others off the stage. Cartman gets up and follows him]"
361,4,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw, screw God. I'm not scared o' him. He's a pussy. [the stage is empty now, but Cartman returns and looks up] You know I'm just kiddin', right? Heheyeah. [turns and walks off again]"
