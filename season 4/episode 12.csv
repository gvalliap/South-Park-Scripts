0,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what's your little brother doing here?"
1,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Ike is starting his first day of kindergarten.
2,4,12,Stan Marsh,But isn't he only three years old?
3,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but he's some kind of genius, so he's getting advanced placement in kindergarten."
4,4,12,Ike Broflovski,I pooped my pants.
5,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[moves Ike aside and shows his folder] But dude, check out my new Trapper Keeper. [opens it up and displays the inside] It has five different compartments for each subject in school, [closes it and shows off the covers] and it's all covered with pictures from Dawson's Creek."
6,4,12,Stan Marsh,Cool!
7,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[walks up with his own folder] Hey, dudes. Check out my sweet Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Ultra Keeper Futura 2000. [slight pause. Kyle reacts] Yeah, well, [opens his up] it's got ten different compartments for every subject in school, an electronic pencil sharpener, four plastic bags with electronic zippers, copy machine, fax, a better picture of Dawson's Creek on the back than Kyle's, [opens it up again] flat-screen TV, and of course, OnStar."
8,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Wow, cool!"
9,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddammit, Cartman! You only got that because you knew my mom would buy it for me!"
10,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, but you have a Trapper Keepe-- Oh, you got the little Crapper Keeper, didn't you? Well, at least your stupid brother got a briefcase."
11,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,He's going to kindergarten because he's a genius!
12,4,12,Eric Cartman,He's not a genius; he's a little douchebag.
13,4,12,Ike Broflovski,I pooped my pants!
14,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"He's smarter than you, fat boy! I don't even know how you made it into fourth grade! I thought--"
15,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Trapper Keeper, I need to drown out my annoying friend. Please initiate music, country, high volume. [soft music plays and Cartman starts to dance]"
16,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman! [music continues, and the bus rolls up]"
17,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Ms. Crabtree, there's another creepy homeless guy on the bus."
18,4,12,Ms Crabtree,Sit down and shut up!!
19,4,12,Stan Marsh,But they smell like pee.
20,4,12,Man,[in European accent] I am not a homeless person. I am a new fourth-grade student.
21,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,You are?
22,4,12,Man,Yes! My name is Bill. Bill Cosby.
23,4,12,Stan Marsh,Aren't you a little old to be in grade school?
24,4,12,Bill,"I was held back ten human grades. [grimaces and grunts] I mean, grades. Do you companion-friends know Eric Cartman?"
25,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that's me."
26,4,12,Bill,Eric Cartman?  And you have a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000?
27,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeahhh, you already know about it?"
28,4,12,Bill,"Yes. Yes, I do."
29,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Well... [mocking] ""Nobody gives a crap about your Trapper Keeper, Cartman!"""
30,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,I'm gonna shove that thing up your ass!
31,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, do you really care if Cartman has something that's better than yours?"
32,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I don't! I don't care!"
33,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[stick the notebook out] Here, Kyle. [Bill stares at Cartman's Trapper Keeper]"
34,4,12,Boy 1,"Hey, there he is. That's the kid that's s'posed to be some kind of genius."
35,4,12,Boy 2,"Yeah, he's only three and he's already in kindergarten."
36,4,12,Boy 1,"Come on. [The two boys walk up to Ike and sit on the chairs on either side of him] So, you think you're smarter than the rest of us? Do you think you know more about the world just because you are only 3 and we're 5?"
37,4,12,Ike Broflovski,Unkoo baba.
38,4,12,Mr Garrison,"[enters the room] Okay, children, let's take our seats. [closes the door and approaches the table] My name is Mr. Garrison, and I'm the new kindergarten teacher. I used to be the third grade teacher, but I had a little [wags the index and ring finger of each hand] ""nervous breakdown"" and went into the mountains where I lived off of ""rat carcasses"". [a view of some of the kids' reactions] But I'm all better now, and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching, as long as it was for kindergarten. [a view of other kids' reactions] But it's not a demotion. No. I mean, just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten, that's not a demotion, is it? [the kids look confused] No, that's right, it's not. Well, let's start with roll call. Uh, let's see. Filmore Anderson?"
39,4,12,Filmore Anderson,Here.
40,4,12,Mr Garrison,Sally Bands?
41,4,12,"Kindergarteners

 Sally Bands
 Billy Harris
 Flora",Here.
42,4,12,Mr Garrison,Ike Broflovski?
43,4,12,Ike Broflovski,Cookie Monster.
44,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Broflovski, I had your older brother Kyle in my third-grade class. He's a very smart kid. I'm sure you are, too. [Fillmore and his friend glare at Ike] Well that's bad news for everybody else, because I will be grading you all on a curve. [Ike looks at Filmore and friend and starts to sink in his seat]"
45,4,12,Eric Cartman,And so the other thing that makes my Trapper Keeper cooler than Kyle's is that it can add any peripheral device to itself automatically. [Kyle glares at him with arms crossed.] I can take something as simple as this calculator [a Wellington Bear model] and... Trapper Keeper?
46,4,12,Trapper Keeper,[its TV screen turns on] Trapper Keeper active.
47,4,12,Eric Cartman,Hybrid with Wellington Bear calculator.
48,4,12,Trapper Keeper,Ready for hybrid. [Two cables reach out and grab the calculator and pull it into a ready slot. Cartman closes the Trapper Keeper]
49,4,12,Eric Cartman,"And now it can use Wellington Bear calculator, too."
50,4,12,Kids,Wow.
51,4,12,Bill,[reaches over Cartman's shoulder] May I hold your Trapper Keeper?
52,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Uh, n-no, I'm afraid not, Bill Cosby, because it is coded to the prints on my fingers. [wiggles them outstretched] If anybody but me tries to hold it, big metal spikes come out and pierce through their hands."
53,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, you are so full of crap, Cartman! Metal spikes will not come out!"
54,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh really? [hands the folder over to Kyle] Then, why don't you hold it? [Kyle looks at it in Cartman's outstretched hand.] Well, go on, Kyle. If it doesn't have metal spikes, then hold it. [inches closer and whispers] Hold it."
55,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,I'm gonna!
56,4,12,Eric Cartman,[inches closer and whispers] Hold it.
57,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,I will!
58,4,12,Mr Garrison,"And that's how the relationship with my father sort of ended. There's still some sort of skeletons in the closet, but things between us are a little better. [some of the kids are stunned. Garrison starts writing on the board] Okay, children, well now it's time for us to elect a class president, [writes up ""KINDERGARTEN CLASS PRESIDENT"" on the chalkboard and underlines it] so first we must pick nominees. [turns and faces the class] Who would like to nominate someone?"
59,4,12,Boy 2,"I nominate Filmore, because he's the smartest kid in the class."
60,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, Filmore. [writes the name on the board] You'll be our first nominee. And who else? [a girl raises her hand] Yes, Jenny."
61,4,12,Jenny,I gotta go doodie.
62,4,12,Mr Garrison,"In a minute, Jenny. Who else wants to nominate a class president? [the kids stay quiet] Oh, come on! You can't have an election with just one person running! What's the fun in that? Ike? How about you? You're a genius."
63,4,12,Ike Broflovski,[looks at an angry Fillmore and friend] No.
64,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, our second nominee is Ike the genius. [writes the name up on the board. Filmore and friend stare at a chagrined Ike] Okay, children, now we'll hear briefly from each nominee. Filmore, why don't you go first?"
65,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"[leaves his seat, approaches the board, and faces the class] If I'm elected class president, I'll call for big ol' chairs. And on Fridays, I'll add two minutes to nap time. Thank you. [returns to his seat]"
66,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Very enthralling. Okay, Ike? How about you?"
67,4,12,Ike Broflovski,"[leaves his seat, approaches the board, and faces the class] Cookie Monster. Ice."
68,4,12,Mr Garrison,"...Well, this is gonna be a tough one, kids."
69,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no, dude, here comes that weird new kid."
70,4,12,Bill,"Ahhh, hello Eric. Can I be your human friend? [winces] I mean, friend?"
71,4,12,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, dude. I'm not supposed to have any male friends that are over 30. I kind of screwed on that once."
72,4,12,Bill,"Please. We can have fun and play games, like human four square-- [coughs up] I mean, four square."
73,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you can't just ask to be somebody's friend and be their friend; it doesn't work that way. If you want to be my friend, you'll have to pay me."
74,4,12,Bill,"Oh, I see. Alright, I'll pay 100 geliga stones-- Uh, I mean, human dollars! Eugh, I mean dollars!"
75,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that's cool."
76,4,12,Bill,[holds up the tetherball] Can we play some human tetherball?
77,4,12,Eric Cartman,"A-alright. Pretty sweet, you guys, getting a hundred bucks to play tetherball with some-- [by this time, ""Bill"" has pulled away from the pole and Cartman, and has the tether taut and ready to release]"
78,4,12,Bill,"Serve! [whips the ball at Cartman, knocking him onto his back. The Trapper Keeper falls away and lands next to Kenny. ""Bill"" makes his move]"
79,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Ugh..! [""Bill"" goes after the Trapper Keeper and runs away with it]"
80,4,12,Bill,Got it!
81,4,12,Eric Cartman,Ey!
82,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude! He's running off with your Trapper Keeper! [just then, spikes come out of the Trapper Keeper and some of them go clear through ""Bill's"" hands.]"
83,4,12,Bill,[stops and looks at his pierced hands] Waa-agggh! [clenches his teeth and continues running]
84,4,12,Eric Cartman,"You son of a bitch! [recalls something] Wait a minute. [whips out a small gadget and activates it] Lucky for me, I have my Trapper Keeper homing device. [walks towards the source of the sound heard in the device and away from his friends]"
85,4,12,Stan Marsh,[confused] What the hell just happened?
86,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,[angry] Damn! I thought fourth grade was gonna be different.
87,4,12,Mr Garrison,"So that's six votes for Filmore and six votes for Ike. [sets the chalk down and reads the last ballot] And the last vote is for... Uh, let's see. Flora, I can't tell who you voted for. [Flora, a timid, pretty blond girl trying to bury her face into her laps, which are raised up on the chair, is shown] You've got the winning vote, Flora. Who d'you pick?"
88,4,12,"Kindergarteners

 Flora","Um, I vote for... I don't know."

99,4,12,Other kids,Yeah! [the kids start to argue]
100,4,12,Some Kids,Filmore!
101,4,12,Other Kids,Ike!
102,4,12,Girl,I want Ike to be president! [several kids from Filmore's side rush across the table to kids on Ike's side]
103,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, for Christ's sakes, you're all acting like a bunch o' kids!"
104,4,12,Eric Cartman,Turn left here! We're getting close! Get your gun ready!
105,4,12,Officer Barbrady,"Eric, I'm not gonna shoot anybody for taking your school folder."
106,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[grabs Barbrady's ] It was not a school folder, it was a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper Futura S 2000! And if-- [spots ""Bill""] There he is!"
107,4,12,Bill,[turns to see the cruiser coming his way] Wagh!
108,4,12,Eric Cartman,Got ya! [grabs the steering wheel from Barbrady]
109,4,12,Officer Barbrady,"Hey! [Cartman steers the cruiser into a building, crushing ""Bill"" and rattling the building]"
110,4,12,Bill,"Gaagghhh! [crumples to the floor. Barbrady and the others exit the car and gather at Bill. His left arm has been amputated, revealing functioning wires. The lower half holding the Trapper Keeper in hand. Barbrady and the boys stare in shock]"
111,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude..!"
112,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Ahh, try to take my Trapper Keeper, will you?"
113,4,12,Bill,Please. You do not understand.
114,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[takes his place] Book him, Barbrady. Another job well done."
115,4,12,Bill,[plaintive] That Trapper Keeper has to be destroyed!
116,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Why are you so obsessed with Cartman's Trapper Keeper, Bill Cosby?"
117,4,12,Officer Barbrady,Bill Cosby?
118,4,12,Bill,Nooo! Listen to me! I am not really Bill Cosby. [the boys and Barbrady show shock] My name is BSM-471. I am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034.
119,4,12,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I knew you weren't Bill Cosby!"
120,4,12,BSM 471,"I have come to destroy that Trapper Keeper, because it was the Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper that belongs to an Eric Cartman in South Park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being, and destroys all of humanity. In the year 2004, a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer. From there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world. [cables reach out from the Trapper Keeper and engulf two computers. The process continues engulfing all of the US] It became stronger and stronger, until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind [skulls litter the landscape] and there was nothing the humans could do. [in the distance a Dawson's Creek Trapper Keeper tower rises] It wasn't long before Mighty Trapper Keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless, including humans. [people are shot left and right from the Trapper Keeper's weapons] The nations tried everything to stop it. [troops line up and fire at the Trapper Keeper] Nuclear devices, seismic missiles. But nothing worked. [robotic tanks come into view, firing away at the Trapper Keeper] The humans built robots of their own, whole armies of them. [DC TK209s approach the advancing armies and fire at them] But nothing was strong enough to stop Trapper Keeper. [the battle scene fades, and BSM-471 is shown once again on the ground] And so finally, the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the Trapper Keeper before it even got started."
121,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Wow, that's amazing."
122,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Man, I guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast."
123,4,12,Stan Marsh,"What do you think, Officer Barbrady?"
124,4,12,Officer Barbrady,"Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening."
125,4,12,BSM 471,"And so, Eric. Now you see why we must destroy your Trapper Keeper."
126,4,12,Eric Cartman,[long pause] You guys. Did I mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener?
127,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity!"
128,4,12,Eric Cartman,"What would you guys have me do, huh?! Walk around with just a plain old Trapper Keeper like Kyle's?! Is that what you want?!"
129,4,12,Stan Marsh,Yes!
130,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Aw, damnit! [throws his Trapper Keeper to the ground] Here! Take it! You want my heart as well?! You'll find it on the bottom of your shoes! [walks off to his left sadly]"

 Flora",Umm... Ike.
134,4,12,Supporters,Yay!
135,4,12,Mr Garrison,"[adds the tally to Ike's total] Okay, so then the total is six for Filmore and now seven votes for Ike. Ike is the new class president."
136,4,12,Filmore Anderson,We want a recount.
137,4,12,Mr Garrison,[miffed] What?
138,4,12,Filmore s Supporters,Recount! Recount! Recount! Recount!
139,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, of all the juvenile things I've ever heard! You lost, Filmore! Don't be such a baby! [Filmore cries and throws a tantrum, pounding away on the classroom table] Alright, alright, I'll count up the ballots again. Okay, we had one vote for Filmore... [writes Filmore's name on the board. A time lapse shows him writing on a crowded board now] ...And this time, I again get six votes for Filmore and seven votes for Ike."
140,4,12,Filmore Anderson,Count them again.
141,4,12,Supporters,Yeah!
142,4,12,Mr Garrison,"No, children! I've recounted 106 times now and I keep coming up with seven to six! Except in the one instance where it came out seven to five, and one where it came out twelve to fourteen. It's over! Ike is class president!"
143,4,12,Kid 2,"Wait, there's still that absent kid."
144,4,12,Fillmore,"Yeah. If Carlos is absent, we have to wait for his vote."
145,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh, will you grow up?!"
146,4,12,Supporters,[clamoring] Absent kids count! Absent kids count! Absent kids count!
147,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Jesus..! Alright, we'll wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote. Now go home! [the kids leave]"
148,4,12,BSM 471,"Good morning, humans."
149,4,12,Stan Kyle,"Hey, Bill Cosby."
150,4,12,BSM 471,"I have successfully destroyed Eric Cartman's Trapper Keeper. I broke it apart, dipped the motherboards in acid, burned the memory chips, and sent the wiring to the four corners of Canada."
151,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,That should do it.
152,4,12,Stan Marsh,"So what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now, Bill Cosby?"
153,4,12,BSM 471,"Well, that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment. I am still here, but I shouldn't be here. If Trapper Keeper has been stopped, then I should not exist. But here I am. Something is still not right."
154,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[walks up with another Trapper Keeper] Hey, dudes."
155,4,12,Stan Marsh,Cartman! You still got a Trapper Keeper!
156,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm a genius! Last night I went home and told my mom that I lost the last one. Then I cried and I cried, and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one! [holds it up high] So everything worked out."
157,4,12,BSM 471,[frightened] Oh no!
158,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you dumbass! You can't get a new one!"
159,4,12,Eric Cartman,Why the hell not?!
160,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Because if your Trapper Keeper takes over the world, then maybe it was this Trapper Keeper and not the one before!"
161,4,12,Eric Cartman,Wait... so then you guys burned my last one for no reason!
162,4,12,BSM 471,We will have to destroy this Trapper Keeper.
163,4,12,Eric Cartman,[holds his Trapper Keeper close] But I don't think I can get my mom to buy me another one.
164,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't you get it?! You can't have any Trapper Keepers, fat ass!"
165,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, that is bullcrap! And you know what I think? I think this whole thing is a setup! That's right! Kyle got this guy to say that he's a robot from the future just because he's jealous of my Trapper Keeper! And you know what else? Screw you guys. I'm going home. [moves off to his left]"
166,4,12,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
167,4,12,Eric Cartman,Ech! Screw you guys. Home. [walks away]
168,4,12,BSM 471,"Well, that does it! [pull out a pocket phaser from his overcoat and aims it at Cartman]"
169,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! What are you doing?
170,4,12,BSM 471,"I'm afraid I have no other choice. [pulls the phaser back] For the sake of humanity, I have to kill him."
171,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh... Okay.
172,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's fine. [""Bill"" aims the phaser once again] No, wait!"
173,4,12,BSM 471,What?
174,4,12,Stan Marsh,Can I do it?
175,4,12,BSM 471,"Oh, well, I suppose. [tosses the phaser to Stan]"
176,4,12,Stan Marsh,"[takes it and quickly aims] Sweet! Kiss your ass goodbye, fat boy!"
177,4,12,BSM 471,"Wait! [grabs it back] Perhaps there is another way. If you could take me to where Eric Cartman lives, I could try reasoning with his human mother."
178,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, yeah, or we could just kill him."
179,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that'd be faster."
180,4,12,Stan Marsh,He's right there.
181,4,12,BSM 471,"I'm afraid I can't. I think I'm actually starting to feel what you humons call ""compassion"". It is an amazing feeling!"
182,4,12,Stan Kyle Kenny,Awww..!
183,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Alright children, as you know, we've been waiting for the absent kid's ballot to come in. Well, his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote. Ms. Harris? [she walks in with a little boy attached to IV bag on a pole. The kid hands him the ballot and coughs out an organ] Thank you very much, Billy. Don't forget to pick up your lung. [Billy starts to walk away, then stops to pick it up] Alright, the absent kid's ballot is for... [reads] Filmore."

199,4,12,Trapper Keeper,"Trapper Keeper ready to ensorb. [cables reach out and grab Cartman's computer like a giant hand, and pull it towards the Trapper Keeper]"
200,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, cool."

206,4,12,Liane Cartman,"Well, I certainly won't buy him anymore, then... Bill. [starts flirting with him]"
207,4,12,BSM 471,Good. Now all that is left to do is destroy the Trapper Keeper Eric has now. Where is he?
208,4,12,Liane Cartman,"In his room. But, why don't I show you the rest of the house first? [pulls ""Bill"" from the chair]"
209,4,12,Stan Marsh,Uh-oh.
210,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Here we go again.
211,4,12,Liane Cartman,"Come this way, Billy. [takes him away from the table]"
212,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, come on. Let's go upstairs and get Cartman's Trapper Keeper ourselves. [he and Kenny leave the table, with Kyle following]"
213,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Kyle is just jealous of you, Trapper Keeper. You kick ass!I don't wanna let my Trapper Keeper get--"
214,4,12,Stan Marsh,"[knocks on the door] Open up, Cartman! We're taking your Trapper Keeper! [Cartman hops off his chair and dances to the door. He locks it and continues singing]"
215,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Screw you guys, screw you guysScrew you guys, scr--"
216,4,12,Trapper Keeper,"Trapper Keeper, ready to ensorb."
217,4,12,Eric Cartman,Huh? [walks towards his computer]
218,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[in the hallway, pounds on the door] Dammit, Cartman, open up!"
219,4,12,Trapper Keeper,"Trapper Keeper, ready for hybrid."
220,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, sweet. What's it gonna hybrid with now? [cables come from the monitor and grab him] Ugh--!"
221,4,12,Stan Marsh,"[pounds on the door] Cartman, you might as well open up! We're just gonna have Bill Cosby bust the door down after he finishes having sex with your mom. [he and Kyle now notice the groans coming from the room]"
222,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman? [inside, cables wrap tight around his face and go in, transforming his body into a grotesque hybrid, and the hybrid begins to grow] He's not gonna open it. Break it down."
223,4,12,Stan Marsh,You break it down!
224,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. Ready? One, two, three, not it!"
225,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Not it! You lose, Kenny. [he and Kyle quickly step out of the way]"
226,4,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Awww..!) [goes to the far wall and then rushes the door, only to be plastered against the far wall...] (Argh--!) [...by the unhinged bedroom door being pushed out by the evolving Trapper Keeper. The boys are frozen in place with mouths open]"
227,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
228,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,You ba--! [the boys make a run for it down the hall and down the stairs as the Trapper Keeper oozes out of Cartman's room]
229,4,12,Stan Kyle,"Agggghhh! [the Trapper Keeper bursts through every window in the house and then the house begins to crumble around it. It collapses in on itself. moves away from the house, leaving ""Bill"" and Liane in bed fully exposed to the elements]"
230,4,12,Liane Cartman,"[on top] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah!"
231,4,12,Mr Garrison,"What the hell is that? [walks to the window and looks out] Oh my God! What is that thing? Children, there's some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom! [some of the kids slink down in their seats] Oh my God, it's awful! It's coming for the door. [the doorknob turns and the kindergartners crouch in terror]"
232,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"Hello, kids!"
233,4,12,Filmore Anderson,Aunt Rosie!
234,4,12,Mr Garrison,"[in a panic] Run for your lives, children! [grabs a bat] I'll try to fight it off!"
235,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"That's my aunt, Rosie O'Donnell."
236,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh. Oh, um... Pleasure to meet you, Miss Donnell. You're looking... well."
237,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"Don't worry, kids. Everything's gonna be fine. What's the problem?"
238,4,12,Filmore Anderson,Aunt Rosie. We think I won class president.
239,4,12,Ike Supporter,"No, Ike won."
240,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Look, it's very simple. We took a vote and the vote tied, so now we gotta come up with a way--"
241,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"Well it obviously isn't that simple, is it? I mean, you'd think a little kindergarten teacher could've handled this, but now we're gonna do it my way!"
242,4,12,Trapper Keeper,[now with Cartman's voice] We are Trapper Keeper.
243,4,12,BSM 471,[on a bluff with Stan and Kyle looking at the Trapper Keeper leave town] Oh no! It is heading for Cheyenne Mountain!
244,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Why is that bad?
245,4,12,BSM 471,It was when the Trapper Keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at Cheyenne Mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers!
246,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Then we have to stop it before it gets there! [leads the others off the bluff and onto a waiting cruiser. ""Bill"" takes the wheel and Kyle takes the passenger window seat]"
247,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Step on it, Bill Cosby! [""Bill"" starts the cruiser and drives off]"
248,4,12,Guard 2,"Hey, Mark, look."
249,4,12,Mark,"Wow. That is about the nicest Trapper Keeper I've ever seen. [a police siren is heard, and promptly ""Bill"" arrives with Stan and Kyle. They hop out of the car and face the Trapper Keeper]"
250,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, you have to stop!"
251,4,12,Trapper Keeper,We are Trapper Keeper. We are one.
252,4,12,BSM 471,"A part of your friend must still be alive in there. [the three of them study the Trapper Keeper from a distance until Stan finds a ventilation hose coming out of it. Smoke comes out of it, and a fart is heard]"
253,4,12,Stan Marsh,He is in there.
254,4,12,BSM 471,"That must be what Trapper Keeper is using for ventilation. If one of you could get in there, you could reach the CPU."
255,4,12,Stan Marsh,"One-two-three, not it!"
256,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Not-- Aw, damnit..! [walks up to the hissing hose and climbs in]"
257,4,12,Eric Cartman,"[à la HAL 9000] What are you doing, Kyle?"
258,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm going to try and break you away from the computer, Cartman. I need to remove the CPU."
259,4,12,Eric Cartman,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Kyle."
260,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Screw you, fat ass!"
261,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Hey, screw you."
262,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman! [hits a wall with a wrench]
263,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Agh--! [four metallic arms from all directions reach out to trap him, then six more organic ones come in to secure him]"
264,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,No!
265,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"[sits on a chair with Filmore on her lap] Okay, so then what we're going to do is count everybody's vote by hand, and after that, we're gonna go over the votes again manually, and then--"
266,4,12,Mr Garrison,"[throws a fit] Oh, stop it, stop it! Stop i-i-it! [the kids and Rosie look at him] Look kids, we're all in this kindergarten class together. We have to respect one another or else we're in for a terrible school year."
267,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,We're just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew don't get cheated.
268,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Half the kids in the class didn't vote for your nephew, so what about them? You don't give a crap about them because they're not on your side! People like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time, but when it comes to Middle America, you think we're all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment! Well, just because you're on TV doesn't mean you know crap about the government! Now get your ass back on first class and respect this class's right to make up their own minds! [Rosie and the kids gasp] ...Oh, sorry I got a little off the subject, kids."
269,4,12,Rosie O Donnell,"How dare you?! I will not be preached at by a country pumpkin! [heads for the door and stands at the entrance] I'm leaving this podunk town, but in my place I'm gonna send more lawyers, statesmen and press than you have ever seen! [exits and slams the door shut]"
270,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Oh no, children, I think I've just made this a whole lot worse."
271,4,12,Ladies,"Aaghh! [hurry away. The Trapper Keeper absorbs the phone booth, and another of its appendages goes after a police car]"
272,4,12,Cops,"Wagghh! [hurry away. In the distance ""Bill,"" the two security guards, and Stan watch Trapper Keeper get bigger and bigger. Behind them, the rest of South Park gathers and sees the spectacle]"
273,4,12,Mark,Well that does it. I'm gonna have to report this. [whips out a walkie-talkie and starts] Car one to base-- [another appendage reaches down and pulls him up and away] Aghh! [Trapper Keeper swallows him up]
274,4,12,BSM 471,It is infusing with everything. It is already too powerful to stop!
275,4,12,Stan Marsh,Kyle's got to succeed. He's just got to.
276,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,I can't reach the CPU.
277,4,12,Rosie O'Donnell,What are you doin'?! Get out of my way!
278,4,12,Guard 2,"Oh, no! Now there's two of those things!"
279,4,12,Stan Marsh,"No, I think that other thing is Rosie O'Donnell. [an indecisive appendage hovers over Rosie]"
280,4,12,Guard 2,Huh? Which one? I-It's just like I'm seeing double.
281,4,12,Rosie O'Donnell,"[to Trapper Keeper] I said, get out of my way! [another appendage wraps around her and tries to pull her in] Aaaaggghhhh!!! [Trapper Keeper swells and heaves, and the fleshy appendage swallows Rosie up] Ogh. Noo-- [the appendage pulls her up and into Trapper Keeper]"
282,4,12,Trapper Keeper,Eeww.
283,4,12,BSM 471,Look! I think that infusing with Rosie O'Donnell has made Trapper Keeper sick.
284,4,12,Trapper Keeper,Oohh... Bad pie... Bad pie... [begins to deflate and wither. Its appendages wither and begin to drop off as it darkens]
285,4,12,Stan Marsh,"This is your chance, Kyle! Cartman has weakened!"
286,4,12,Kyle Broflovski,Got 'em!
287,4,12,Stan Marsh,He did it!
288,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, the lawyers for Ike's side have agreed with the lawyers on Filmore's side to hold another meeting regarding Form 22F. Do we all have that form? [the door opens, and in walks...]"
289,4,12,Jesse Jackson,Is this the kindergarten classroom?
290,4,12,Mr Garrison,Jesse Jackson?
291,4,12,Jesse Jackson,That's right! I believe the African-American in your class were misrepresented!
292,4,12,Mr Garrison,[covering his face] We don't have any African-Americans in our class!
293,4,12,Jesse Jackson,Oh. Bye. [turns and walks out. Filmore raises his hand]
294,4,12,Mr Garrison,"Alright, so apparently what we're gonna do now is hand-count each person's ballot--"
295,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"Mistoreh Garrison, I concede. [Mr. Garrison's jaw drops, as do those of Filmore's lawyers]"
296,4,12,Mr Garrison,"You... yuh, you what?"
297,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"I don't wanna play anymore, 'cause this game is stupid."
298,4,12,"Kindergarteners 
 Jenny
 Sally Bands
 Billy Harris
 Flora",Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.
299,4,12,Filmore Anderson,"Ike, you could be class president."
300,4,12,Ike Broflovski,I pooped my pants!
301,4,12,"Kindergarteners 
 Jenny
 Sally Bands
 Billy Harris
 Flora",[throws up her hands] Can we fingerpaint now?
302,4,12,Kids,[clamoring] Fingerpaint! Fingerpaint!
303,4,12,Mr Garrison,Ohuh... Yes. [exults] Yes! Let's fingerpaint!
304,4,12,Stan Marsh,"You did it, Kyle! [to Cartman] Kyle saved your life, fat ass!"
305,4,12,BSM 471,Look! I'm fading! [begins to fade from view] It must have worked. I don't exist! [disappears]
306,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Huh, that's a bitch."
307,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Well, I guess everything's fine now. So let's go home."
308,4,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey! Whoa whoa whoa, Cartman! All you've been doing is making fun of Kyle and now he's saved your life! You at least owe him a thank you!"
309,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Awww, man..."
310,4,12,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
311,4,12,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright. [sighs] Kyle..."
