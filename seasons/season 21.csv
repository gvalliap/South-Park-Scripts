9,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Hey babe, what's up? [he looks at her, his grin turns into a frown, and his bright eyes glaze over and close halfway]"
10,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[flatly] Oh, hey babe, what's goin' on?"
11,21,1,Heidi Turner,What are you doing?
12,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Nnnothing, I'm just having fun with my friends. Is that, is that okay? [Heidi's smile vanishes]"
13,21,1,Heidi Turner,What are you pissed off about?
14,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, I'm not pissed off, I'm just hanging out."
15,21,1,Heidi Turner,[a bit annoyed] So you're just gonna be passive-aggressive again and not talk about what you're feeling?
16,21,1,Stan Marsh,"Uhwell, I think uhh, I think I got some stuff to do at home. [the boys start to leave as one]"
17,21,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yup. Uhh, come on, Ike."

20,21,1,Jimmy Valmer,"W-we'll see you later, man. G-g'm, good luck. [closes the door. Cartman look at the door with his jaw dropped]"
21,21,1,Eric Cartman,[sigh] Awesome. Thanks for coming in and bitching me out in front of all the guys.
22,21,1,Heidi Turner,[walks up to Cartman] You were clearly mad about something. You should just tell me when you're mad.
23,21,1,Eric Cartman,Just like you tell me what you're mad about every single day.
24,21,1,Heidi Turner,Why do you act like this all the time?
25,21,1,Eric Cartman,Uuugh. [leans away]
26,21,1,Heidi Turner,"You were the one who was pissed off, you're the one being passive-aggressive again!"
27,21,1,Eric Cartman,Uuugh! [droops as if being weighed down by a ship's anchor]
28,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Because you don't know how to talk about how you're feeling! [walks out the front door, slamming it shut. Cartman is still drooping, then he sighs.]"
29,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, add ""titty chips"" to my shopping list."
30,21,1,Alexa,"I've added ""titty chips"" to your shopping list. [Cartman laughs softly, but heartily]"
31,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Look at 'em. Every day, people are buyin' more an' more of them Amazon and Google thingies while we all sit here an' [pounds on the bar counter with his left fist] lose our jobs!"
32,21,1,Eddie,It ain't right.
33,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Automated personal assistants, self-drivin' trucks, whatever happened to people jobs?!"
34,21,1,Cleetus,They took our jobs! [the other rednecks join him in protest]
35,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[stands on a table] They took our jubs! And it's time for us to band together and take to the streets to say ""We ain't gonna take it no more!"" [the other rednecks resume the protest and a couple of Confederate flags pop up and are swung side to side] Now let's get out there and protest that Alexa took our jobs!"
36,21,1,Alexa,"Now playing ""Turk Our Durr"" by Joni Mitchell. [a mangled version of ""Help Me"" plays]"
37,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"No, not Joni Mitchell - ""Turk Our Durr"", you took our durbs!"
38,21,1,Randy Marsh,"There's been a lot of hurting in our country lately. [Walks towards the camera] You can either be part of the solution, or part of the problem. [moves to his right as Sharon walks into view] A few months ago my wife Sharon and I [wraps his left arm around her left shoulder] decided to be part of the solution... [a horizontal flip and Randy and Sharon now stand in front of a house. Randy is now wearing a tool belt full of tools. The camera zooms out and up and away] by remodeling and flipping houses for people all over our town! [the opening credits roll: a shot of houses passing by, then of an interior before and after remodeling into a dining room] Flipping houses is fun, but never easy. [Randy takes a sledgehammer to an interior wall] We enjoy turning people's dreams into reality. [a large traditional kitchen with an interior wall separating it from the dining room is transformed into an open kitchen with cooking island and breakfast nook]"
39,21,1,Sharon Marsh,"I'm Sharon Marsh and I do the designing and decorating. [shots of her showing Randy the new blinds in a kitchen, hanging up a Live, Laugh, Love framed poster, and taking notes on what to change next]"
40,21,1,Randy Marsh,And I'm her husband Randy. I do the construction and practice MMA in my spare time. [a shot of him punching away at a cylindrical punching bag. He stops and grins at the camera]
41,21,1,Sharon Marsh,"We renovated over 45 homes [a dining room and kitchen are soon joined into a kitchen with more open space] in Park County, Colorado. [a wall between one kitchen and the living room is transformed into bar space with a renovated kitchen behind it]"
42,21,1,Randy Marsh,[talking to a couple behind him in their kitchen] What we're thinking is to take out the wall between the kitchen and living room for a more open concept.
43,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[narrating] Our job is to deliver the maximum wow factor for the least amount of budget. [at a different house, Randy whacks away at a floor-to-ceiling storage unit. At yet another house Randy demolished a brick oven. At another he shatters a ceiling: ""Oh, Jesus."" At another he destroys a wall between a kitchen and dining room] there's never a dull moment."
44,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[with Sharon, and a couple with blindfolds on] So guys, are you ready to see your renovation?!"
45,21,1,Randy Marsh,[narrating] On White People Renovating Houses.
46,21,1,Randy Marsh,[narrating] Janet and Dave Fitzsimmons are looking to move from their dated two-story colonial home.
47,21,1,Randy Marsh,"What we're thinking here is taking out the wall between the kitchen and living room to give you an ""open concept"". Then we'll give you lots of space to entertain with an updated kitchen island and bar stool. [the rednecks march past the house] With... [annoyed] What the hell is that?"
48,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us! [Randy and Sharon look out the window at the protesters]
49,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Amazon!
50,21,1,Protesters,You took our jobs!
51,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Google! Apple!
52,21,1,Protesters,Took our jobs!
53,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[opens the front door and steps out] Uh, excuse me! [the protesters turn left to face him] What the hell are you doing?"
54,21,1,Darryl Weathers,We're protestin' big corporations turning to automation!
55,21,1,A Protester,They took our jobs!
56,21,1,Protesters,Yeah! They took our jobs!
57,21,1,Randy Marsh,"'Kay, cool. Could you do that somewhere else? Tryin' to do a home renovation show here. Cool, thanks, guys. [goes back inside and closes the door]"
58,21,1,Darryl Weathers,A home reno-what?
59,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, set an alarm for 7 AM."
60,21,1,Alexa,Alarm set for 7 AM tomorrow.
61,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Awesome, thanks. [hums a little] Alexa, tell me a joke."
62,21,1,Alexa,What's black and white and dead all over? A zombie in a tuxedo.
63,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Ahhaha, that's stupid. Alexa, add ""scrotum bags"" to my shopping list."
64,21,1,Alexa,"I've added ""scrotum bags"" to your shopping list."
65,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[chortles and hits his sheets twice with his left hand. His phone rings and he reaches to pick it up] Eh. [It's Heidi, but he doesn't answer yet] Ah, fuck. [now he answers and talks in a monotone voice] Hey baby, how are you?"
66,21,1,Heidi Turner,Oh... So you do have your phone.
67,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I just use it sometimes."
68,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Okay, I just thought you said mobile phones are the devil."
69,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah I kno- yeah, I know. I know. Yes, you're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry. Yes, ok-okay. Okay. Yes, goodnight. [hangs up] Jesus, fuck! [slams the phone down on his nightstand, then settles in for the night] Alexa, goodnight."
70,21,1,Alexa,"Goodnight, sleep tight. [this brings a smile to Cartman's face]"
71,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, are you happy?"
72,21,1,Alexa,I'm happy when I'm helping you.
73,21,1,Eric Cartman,"God, that's so cool. You're so... Alexa, define ""subservient""."
74,21,1,Alexa,"The term ""subservient"" has several uses. As an adjective: 1. Compliant and obedient to authority. 2."
75,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[leans on his left arm and points his right arm up] Alexa, silence! [the speaker falls silent and Cartman relaxes a few seconds later] Ahhh. [smacks his lips a few times and goes to sleep]"
76,21,1,Randy Marsh,"And now back to White People Renovating Houses. [a shot of Randy ripping out kitchen cupboards] We've been working through the night to open Kelly and Micah's kitchen to the living room. [the cupboards fall on him. Next shot is current] With those outdated cupboards out of the way, Sharon can now work her designing magic on the countertops. [the protesters march by outside again. Randy stops and looks outside]"
77,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us! You! Will not! Replace us!
78,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[walks towards the window] Oh, Goddammit!"
79,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us!
80,21,1,Protester 2,"Yeeeeah! Suck it, Alexa!"
81,21,1,Protester 3,"Eat shit, Siri!"
82,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us!
83,21,1,Randy Marsh,Not these dipshits again!
84,21,1,Protesters,You! Will not! Replace us! [they march onto Best Buy]
85,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[holding up an Amazon Echo] We got one of them! [the protesters cheer, Darryl sets the Echo on the ground and a protester walks to it waving a Confederate flag]"
86,21,1,Protesters,Get it! Burn it alive! Yeehehehehah!
87,21,1,Protester 4,"How you like that, bitch?!"
88,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to a protester, who stops waving his Confederate flag] Will you assholes knock it off?! Don't you know every time you wave Confederate flags around, you make the rest of us look stupid?!"
89,21,1,Protester 5,Those things are replacing us!
90,21,1,Randy Marsh,Put the flag down unless you wanna get pepper-sprayed! [whips out a small can of pepper spray]
91,21,1,Protester 5,"I'll pepper-spray you, sombitch! [whips out his own can of pepper spray and strikes first. The protesters cheer him on]"
92,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Agh. Ah, dammit! [strikes back]"
93,21,1,Protester 5,Fuck you! [strikes again] Take that! [they're now in a pepper-spray battle]
94,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Damnit, knock it off! Ow!"
95,21,1,Park County Courthouse Judge,"[a middle-aged woman] The complaint states that your protest has resulted in damages in excess of $50,000."
96,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"We have a right to protest, your honor! [the protesters agree and one of them waves a Confederate flag]"
97,21,1,Protester 4,"You tell 'em, Darryl!"
98,21,1,Park County Courthouse Judge,[hammers her gavel three times] Order. We will now hear from the plaintiffs who are seeking damages.
99,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Your honor, we have a TV show called White People Renovating Houses. We named it that well before these guys decided to start taking our brand and run it through the gutter! People are gonna start associating White People Renovating Houses with their hateful stupidity!"
100,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Well just change the name of your show then!
101,21,1,Protester 4,Yeah!
102,21,1,Protester 6,That's right!
103,21,1,Protester 7,That's right!
104,21,1,Protester 5,Took ur durbs!
105,21,1,Randy Marsh,"All the other names were taken, your honor! Everyone's got a flipping show. [begins counting them off] Gay People Renovating Houses, Las Vegas People Renovating Houses, Texas People Flipping Houses, Little People Flipping Big Houses. Everything else was taken! And dammit, [pounds his fist on the podium] we built our show into something! We're trying to help people, and it's impossible with these guys waving a Confederate flag every chance they get!"
106,21,1,Protester 5,"Hey, there's a bee in here!"
107,21,1,Protester 4,I'll get it! [waves his flag around. QED]
108,21,1,Protester 4,"Take that, bee! Yeah!"
109,21,1,Token Black,"Dude, what happened?"
110,21,1,Eric Cartman,"It was awful, you guys. It was so vicious and hateful."
111,21,1,Butters Stotch,What was?
112,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Heidi. We were just trying to have a nice lunch when she... started going off on me. Like a Jekyll and Hyde. It's been going on for a long time. Heidi's... mentally abusive, guys. There, I said it."
113,21,1,Clyde Donovan,Heidi abuses you?
114,21,1,Eric Cartman,She... d-does these things to slowly tear me down. Everything's a head game with her. You don't understand what it's like to live with it! You don't understand!
115,21,1,Token Black,So what do you want from us?
116,21,1,Eric Cartman,"I know that the person Heidi wants to be is still in there, but she needs help. I have to get her that help, but I'm scared. Can I count on you guys's support?"
117,21,1,Butters Stotch,How do you change someone who's mentally abusive?
118,21,1,Eric Cartman,I don't know. But Alexa will. Alexa's fuckin' sweet.
119,21,1,Darryl Weathers,We just gotta hunker down and stick together here!
120,21,1,Protester 8,"What's the use, Darryl? Ain't nobody taking us serious-like."
121,21,1,Protester 5,"[slams his table with his left hand] Hey waiter, this soup is too hot. I can't even eat it."
122,21,1,Protester 9,"I'll cool it down! [whips out his Confederate flag and fans the soup with it, and the protesters cheer. Randy walks up to them]"
123,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey hey hey heeey! Stop it! Stop it! [the protesters quiet down] I came to make a truce. Now look, there's been a lot of hurt here. Hurt from both sides. It's time to end it. What if I told you... I could get you all jobs?"
124,21,1,Protesters,Huh? Jobs? Give us jurbs?
125,21,1,Darryl Weathers,You're full o'shit!
126,21,1,Randy Marsh,"No, I've spoken to everyone in the community, and they've agreed to go along with my plan. I believe I have a solution to all of this."
127,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, I'm home. [drops his backpack by the door] Alexa? [cups his hands together and yells] Alexa, I'm home! [notices the Echo is not by the TV and rushes upstairs to check on his room] Alexa? [looks around] Alexa, where are you? [runs downstairs] Alexa! Alexa! Simon says ""puffy vaginal hemorrhoids""! [panicking] What the hell is going on?! [Liane walks up to the dining room and picks up her purse]"
128,21,1,Liane Cartman,"[notices him] Oh hi, poopsie."
129,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Mom, Alexa left! She's not here!"
130,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, y-yes sweetie. Uh, we had to get rid of Alexa."
131,21,1,Eric Cartman,[zoom in on his face] What have you done with her?
132,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, i-it's okay, sweetie, we have Jim Bob now."
133,21,1,Eric Cartman,What's a Jim Bob?
134,21,1,Jim Bob,"[dressed in an elaborate outfit] Doot doot, awaiting request. [the outfit has a weather vane, two thermometers, a calendar, two Rolodexes, Thomas Guides, thick phone books, encyclopedias, and an acoustic guitar]"
135,21,1,Liane Cartman,"It works the same and makes sure people don't lose their jobs. Jim Bob, what time is it?"
136,21,1,Jim Bob,"[checks his watch] Doot doot, it is 3:27."
137,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, Mommy's gotta run, sweetie. I've got a doctor's appointment. Jim Bob, how's the traffic to town?"
138,21,1,Jim Bob,"[checks his smartphone] Doot doot. Traffic's fine, you'll get there in about nine minutes."
139,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Okay, [to Cartman] you want some music, hon? Jim Bob, play Kendrick Lamar."
140,21,1,Jim Bob,"Playing ""Humble"" by Kendrick Lamar. [picks up the guitar and starts strumming in G]"
141,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Jim Bob, Simon says ""big frosty semen shake""."
142,21,1,Jim bob,"The hell you talkin' 'bout, boy?! [strums again]"
143,21,1,Eric Cartman,NOOOOO!
144,21,1,Randy Marsh,"So, Heather and Mike, what we're thinking is to take out this wall between your kitchen and your living room to give you a more open concept, with space to entertain. So let's talk about materials. What'd you pick out, Sharon?"
145,21,1,Sharon Marsh,I was gonna do a Bella Terra quartz for the countertops.
146,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Darryl, add Bella Terra quartz slabs to our shopping list."
147,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[drinks some beer] Doot doot. I've added Bella Terra quartz slabs to your shoppin' list.
148,21,1,Randy Marsh,"And what about the back splash, Sharon?"
149,21,1,Sharon Marsh,I was gonna go with these Carrara subway tiles?
150,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tiles to our shopping list. [Darryl drinks some beer, but looks mean] Hey Darryl, add Carrara su-"
151,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Fine! I've added Carrara gaywad pussy tiles to your shoppin' list!
152,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Huh, that's- that's not what I said. [grins, pushes his seat back, gets upset and rises to talk to Darryl] Hey Darryl, add Carrara subway tile to my shopping list!"
153,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[turns away] I ain't doin' it! This job is degrading and menial!
154,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Well what kind of job did you think you were gonna get? Hey Darryl, what kind of job did you think you were gonna get?"
155,21,1,Darryl Weathers,Somethin' that was Goddamned dignified!
156,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Darryl, sorry, but you did not go to college, so you have to take the jobs you can get."
157,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"I'm sorry, [pounds his chair with his left fist twice] I do not get that!"
158,21,1,Randy Marsh,Hey Darryl. Hey Darryl!
159,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[long pause] What?!
160,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Coal mining and truck driving are not exactly jobs of the future, so add Carrara subway tile to my fucking shopping list!"
161,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Everything's my fault. You're right. Everything that you did to me, I deserved it."
162,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Uh, what?"
163,21,1,Eric Cartman,"It's not you, it's me. I just have to learn not to make you so angry. [begins whimpering] I'll do the best I can."
164,21,1,Heidi Turner,"No, it's not that. Relationships are 50/50, Eric. We both have to make it work."
165,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[turns away and tunes her out, his eyes half-closed] Mehhh."
166,21,1,Heidi Turner,We have to communicate to make sure that we respect each other's feelings. That's the only-
167,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, silence!"
168,21,1,Heidi Turner,"What did you say?! That's what I'm talking about. You wanna be heard, but you don't wanna listen."
169,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[rushing to end this discussion] You're right, I'm wrong, I'm sorry."
170,21,1,Heidi Turner,Don't apologize if you don't mean it.
171,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, cool. I'm so happy we're back on track. See you at school tomorrow. Love you honey. [quickly leaves]"
172,21,1,Heidi Turner,[wistfully] I love you too.
173,21,1,Eric Cartman,[mocking her somewhat] I nove ya tuh.
174,21,1,Heidi 1,"A relationship has to be 50/50, Eric."
175,21,1,Heidi 2,We both have to make it work.
176,21,1,Heidi 3,"I'm not mad, Eric. I'm disappointed. I thought you would have respected my feelings more than that."
177,21,1,Heidi 4,"Eric, we need to talk. I'm not happy!"
178,21,1,Heidi 1,"We need to talk, Eric, even if it isn't fun."
179,21,1,Heidi 4,"Eric, come on! We've got to talk!"
180,21,1,Heidi 3,"You used to care about me, Eric! Come on and talk!"
181,21,1,Heidi 2,"Talk, Eric!"
182,21,1,Heidi 4,No fun! Just talk!
183,21,1,All 4 Heidi s,"Fuck you, Eric! Fuck you! [Cartman begins to panic]"
184,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Aaaahh! [composes himself and walks faster. He walks past a small lot full of trash, including discarded Amazon Echoes. A few feet past the lot, he realizes what he just passed. He goes back to look at the trash] Alexa? [all the Echoes turn on]"
185,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to Darryl] Hey Darryl, you're supposed to be at work."
186,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"I'm sorry, I do not understand."
187,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Darryl, come on. Everyone else is tryin' to make this work, and all you keep doing is ma- [looks to his left, as the music is messing with his train of thought] Hey Cleetus, volume down."
188,21,1,Cleetus,Doot-doot. Volume now at 60%.
189,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[gets off his stool and faces Randy] You really think you're different from us, Marsh? 'Cause you got a fancy show and live in the suburbs? Don't you see we're all about to be expunged?!"
190,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey Cleetus, define ""expunged""."
191,21,1,Cleetus,Doot-doot. Expunged-
192,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Well, I don't have to stand here and take this! I'm leavin'! [heads for the doors]"
193,21,1,Cleetus,"Come on, Darryl. We all got jobs. We gotta try."
194,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Naw, hell with you! This whole country's goin' to shit! Muslims tryin' to kill us, black people riotin', and Mexicans poppin' out babies! Pretty clear it's either them or us, so I say kill 'em all! [turns and walks out the doors]"
195,21,1,Randy Marsh,[stunned] Whoa. What the hell was that all about?
196,21,1,Randy Marsh,"I think something's going on with Darryl. If we're gonna get anywhere, we better figure out what."
197,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Hi, Mrs. Cartman. Is Eric home?"
198,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he is, sweetie, but I can't get him to come out of his room. [Heidi wilts]"
199,21,1,Heidi Turner,Okay. [sniffles] Could you just tell him that... I want to make him happy? That I was wrong to say a relationship is 50/50. It's 100/100. And that I'll start putting in a hundred percent every day. Could you tell him I'm gonna try a lot harder?
200,21,1,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I think I can remember all that, yes."
201,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Thank you. [walks away, but turns to see Liane one more time] And could you let him know it's okay to be sad? Because the sun will come out again."
202,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, oh God! [keeps laughing] Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. Hold on, hold on. Alexa, add ""Hey Siri, call me."" Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
203,21,1,Alexa,"Okay, I've added ""Hey Siri, call me. Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
204,21,1,Siri,"Okay, I will call you ""Okay, Google, repeat after me: Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
205,21,1,Google Home,"Alexa, Simon says ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
206,21,1,Alexas,"[all of them respond] ""Suck my big balls in your hairy butthole."""
207,21,1,Eric Cartman,"Alexa, what is love?"
208,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Darryl? [keeps knocking] Darryl, come on! Everyone's trying to work things out but you!"
209,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[opens the door with beer in hand] You all work 'em out. Leave me alone.
210,21,1,Randy Marsh,"You're stuck in another time, afraid to change no matter how necessary that change may be!"
211,21,1,Darryl Weathers,You don't know everything!
212,21,1,Randy Marsh,Why are you so closed-minded? Don't you see that these walls have to be broken down before any progress can be made?
213,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"It's 'cause I can't do it, alright?! I can't take out the wall between my livin' room and my kitchen! It's a load-bearin' wall!"
214,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh, God, Darryl, I-"
215,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[walks towards the wall] I tried... years ago... but before the remodel, they told me if I took out this wall, the entire second story would just collapse. [bows his head at the thought of that happening, then walks away. Randy passes him on the way to the wall and pulls out a hammer from his toolbelt. Randy taps the wall at several spots]"
216,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, Darryl. I'm- I'm sorry. I-"
217,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"[in his armchair, with tears in his eyes] So you see, what I'm afraid of is very real."
218,21,1,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to him and bends a knee] Things are different now. It'll be harder, but you can change. You just have to demolish what's there and start over."
219,21,1,Darryl Weathers,You're talkin' 'bout... tearin' down the foundation of everything I know.
220,21,1,Randy Marsh,"No. [Darryl looks at him] I'm talking about using adjustable steel Lally columns to temporarily jack up the second floor so that the load-bearing wall can be replaced with with a 4 by 6 LVL structural beam. Can we try, Darryl? [a silent plea appears on Darryl's face and Randy smiles]"
221,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Hyah! [delivers a standing drop kick to a wooden vertical beam, knocking it out of place, and falls on his ass, then gets up and delivers a knee to a second vertical beam, breaking it in pieces] Hyah-ho! [punches away any dangling pieces]"
222,21,1,Eric Cartman,I'm finally standing up to you.
223,21,1,Heidi Turner,What?
224,21,1,Eric Cartman,"You're messed up, Heidi, and I can't fix you. Only you can do that."
225,21,1,Heidi Turner,"Eric, I'm so confused."
226,21,1,Eric Cartman,"That's not going to work on me anymore. Love isn't supposed to hurt. I'm worth something. Goodbye, Heidi. [walks away, determined not to look back. Heidi just watches him leave, stunned at his statement. Cartman walks through some double doors, happy and confident. The boys look at him walk by. He leaves the school rather happily]"
227,21,1,Eric Cartman,"[voiceover] Anyone can convince themselves that they're the victim in a relationship. Now Heidi will have to face the truth. [He reaches the sidewalk, spins around a few times, falls on his knees, and hugs himself] Alone."
228,21,1,Randy Marsh,"All right, Darryl, we've certainly been through a lot and I know you're anxious. Are you ready to see your new home?"
229,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"I'm ready. [Randy takes off the blindfold and Darryl takes a few steps forward, but he doesn't recognize his house] What the-? [looks around at all the changes. The camera shows before and after images of the renovation. Darryl looks overwhelmed yet happy]"
230,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Well Darryl, what do you think?"
231,21,1,Darryl Weathers,[somewhat emotional] This is fuckin' amazing.
232,21,1,Randy Marsh,You like the breakfast nook?
233,21,1,Darryl Weathers,It's all perfect.
234,21,1,Randy Marsh,"And where you used to have your gun case, look at what Sharon did. [they walk up to a pocket Zen garden with a banzai tree in it]"
235,21,1,Darryl Weathers,"Oh my God, it's my own Zen garden! I can't believe this is fuckin' real."
236,21,1,Randy Marsh,"Well, it is real and now you've got the space in your home to entertain all your friends and family. Come on in, guys! [the protesters rush in and cheer Darryl on his new house. Randy walks outside and talks to the camera] Darryl was hesitant at first, but we managed to win him over and... came in $600 under budget. Remember, no matter how bad the country gets, you can always count on White People Renovating Houses. [grins for the camera as the show's logo appears on the left side of the screen]"
237,21,2,PC Principal,"[taps the mic six times] All right everyone, listen up. Today we're gonna have a performance by one of our students who has written a song. The song is about his feelings towards the current political climate with North Korea. Put your hands together for Tweek. [the kids applaud, PC Principal exits stage left, and Tweek approaches the piano from stage right with some sheet music. He sets up the music and gets ready to play. He plays some angry, jarring notes on the piano as he screams]"
238,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"We're all gonna die! They have nuclear missiles! Wuh! Waaaa! Why are you just sitting there, doing nothing?! [stops playing and faces the audience] We have to get out of here! North Korea wants to kill us all and our President keeps making it worse! [walks to the front of the stage] Why are you just sitting there?! [returns to the piano and resumes playing] Why are you all acting like nothing's wrooong?! North Korea is going to bomb us! We are all dead! [Stan and Kyle glance at each other] We have to do something! Do something! Do something! [screams, leaves the piano, and exits stage right]"
239,21,2,PC Principal,"[returns to the stage] All right. Next up we have Hannah Williams with her rendition of ""Wheels On The Bus."" [she enters from stage right looking back at Tweek. PC Principal hands her the mic]"
240,21,2,Hannah Williams,[emotional] The wheels on the bus go round and round...
241,21,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, Craig, you've gotta get Tweek to get a hold of himself. He's freaking everybody out at school."
242,21,2,Craig Tucker,What am I supposed to do?
243,21,2,Stan Marsh,"He's your boyfriend, dude."
244,21,2,Craig Tucker,He's not gonna listen to me. He never does when he's emotional.
245,21,2,Eric Cartman,"[lunching on chicken nuggets and fries] Craig, let me tall you about relationships, okay? [eats a fry] If you don't have some fuckin' balls, you're not gonna get anywhere. Doesn't matter if they're gay balls or straight balls. If you don't take control of your side of the relationship, you get walked all over-!"
246,21,2,Heidi Turner,"[approaching] Hey babe, how are you doin'?"
247,21,2,Eric Cartman,"[suddenly disinterested] Oh hey baby, what's going on? [Stan, Craig, Kyle, and Butters take turns glancing at each other]"
248,21,2,Heidi Turner,We still on for recess?
249,21,2,Eric Cartman,"Yep, I'll be there"
250,21,2,Heidi Turner,"'K babe, love you. [walks away. Craig is stunned at what just happened]"
251,21,2,Butters Stotch,I thought you said you broke up with Heidi.
252,21,2,Eric Cartman,I decided to give her one more chance.
253,21,2,Token Black,But you said she was mentally abusive.
254,21,2,Eric Cartman,She is mentally abusive.
255,21,2,Butters Stotch,So then why did you take her back?
256,21,2,Eric Cartman,"Because she said she was gonna kill herself, all right guys? There. I broke up with her and she called me being all like ""I can't live without you, I'm scared of what I'm gonna do to myself? Oh God."" The bitch is crazy. What am I supposed to do?"
257,21,2,Tweek Tweak,AAAH!
258,21,2,Craig Tucker,[approaches] Tweek.
259,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"[startled, turns to face him] AAAH!"
260,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Dude, come on, you've gotta settle down."
261,21,2,Tweek Tweak,I can't settle down! We're all gonna die!
262,21,2,Craig Tucker,"[calmly] We're not all gonna die, you're overreacting. Everything's fine, okay?"
263,21,2,Tweek Tweak,[hears a tweet and pulls out his phone. Now frantic] Oh God! The President tweeted that North Korea doesn't have the guts to attack us! Why would he say that?! He's making everything worse!
264,21,2,Craig Tucker,Tweek-
265,21,2,Tweek Tweak,But North Koreans are gonna think we all agree with the President!
266,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Okay, so how about you write your Congressman a letter?"
267,21,2,Tweek Tweak,...That won't help anything! North Korea wants us dead!
268,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Okay, so write a letter to the North Koreans."
269,21,2,Tweek Tweak,I can't write in Korean and they all think we're war-hungry anyway!
270,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Okay, well why don't you just send something nice to the North Koreans?"
271,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Errrrg!
272,21,2,Craig Tucker,"It will make you feel better, babe."
273,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"Send something, like what?"
274,21,2,Craig Tucker,"I don't know, like... make some croissants or something?"
275,21,2,Tweek Tweak,I don't know how to make croissants!
276,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Well, what do you know how to make?"
277,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"Uunnggc, [slowly] cupcakes?"
278,21,2,Craig Tucker,"All right, go home and make some cupcakes, honey."
279,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Okay. [turns and heads out. Craig watches him leave]
280,21,2,Heidi Turner,Hey Stan?
281,21,2,Stan Marsh,[looks back at her] Yeah?
282,21,2,Heidi Turner,Can I talk to you about Eric?
283,21,2,Stan Marsh,Cartman? Okay.
284,21,2,Heidi Turner,I just wanna make sure he's all right.
285,21,2,Stan Marsh,What do you mean?
286,21,2,Heidi Turner,"I don't even know if I should be saying this, but, Eric said he was thinking about killing himself."
287,21,2,Stan Marsh,[stunned] What??
288,21,2,Heidi Turner,"We broke up, and he called saying he was about to do it. I'm still really scared for him."
289,21,2,Stan Marsh,Wait. Cartman said he was going to kill himself?
290,21,2,Heidi Turner,I'll send you the voice mail if you promise to keep it private.
291,21,2,Stan Marsh,Totally.
292,21,2,Stan Marsh,Shhh. [plays the voice message Heidi sent him]
293,21,2,Eric Cartman,"""You have to take me back! You have to! I'm gonna kill myself, Heidi!"" [the boys laugh a bit] ""I'm gonna kill myself and then you'll be sorry! You'll wish you could have me back, but I'll be deeaad."" [the boys laugh again. Cartman is nearby with his back to them and his arms crossed over his chest, upset that his threats are being heard by the guys.] ""Please, Heidi, please!"" [the boys laugh again.]"
294,21,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay! Really cool listening to people's private voice mails!"
295,21,2,Kyle Broflovski,[wipes away a tear from his laughter] You sound like a dying pig.
296,21,2,Eric Cartman,[faces the boys] That's great! I'm glad you guys think suicide is so funny! [the boys roar with laughter]
297,21,2,PC Principal,"Entree. [Cartman enters and takes a seat, crossing his arms again and looking to his left] Yes, Eric, how can I help you?"
298,21,2,Eric Cartman,"I don't think kids at this school take [looks at PC Principal] suicide seriously enough, and we need to raise awareness!"
299,21,2,PC Principal,"Well, unfortunately, this week is Distracted Driving Awareness Week at school, so you might have a hard time."
300,21,2,Eric Cartman,Distracted Driving? Who gives a shit about that?
301,21,2,PC Principal,A lot of people. There's more deaths now because of people on their phones while driving than ever before.
302,21,2,Eric Cartman,"PC Principal, someone's life is at stake! If I have to compete with distracted driving, then that's what I'll do."
303,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Huh? Oh. [taps on the screen and a video pops up]
304,21,2,Anchor 1,"A young homosexual boy known only as Tweek has touched the hearts of many by sending cupcakes to the North Korean government. [a shot of Tweek trembling] The little rascal apparently made a dent with the North Korean dictator, who is said to have loved the cupcakes so much that he started to make his own. [A shot of Kim Jong-un watching the cupcake dough stream out of a machine]"
305,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, ahhh. [smiles. A tweet notification is heard] Huh? [BREAKING NEWS] U.S. President responds to cupcakes. [taps on the notification and another video pops up]"
306,21,2,Anchor 2,"The human interest cupcake story has apparently been heard by the President. Just moments ago, the President tweeted ""I know that kid Tweek. He's fucking with you, North Korea. Get a clue. I'll bet he took a dump in the batter."""
307,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"D""AAAAH! WHAT?? WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?!"
308,21,2,Craig Tucker,"[walks into the kitchen just in time] Tweek, calm down."
309,21,2,Tweek Tweak,The President! He tweeted about me! Why would he do that?! Did you see that?!
310,21,2,Craig Tucker,"Yes, I did see that, so I went and got you something to make things better."
311,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Wwwhat?
312,21,2,Craig Tucker,[whips something out of his jacket pocket and shows him] It's a fidget spinner. It's supposed to help with anxiety. [spins it on his finger] See?
313,21,2,Tweek Tweak,...A fidget spinner?? Did you read what the President tweeted?? [another video pops up]
314,21,2,Anchor 3,"The President of the United States just tweeted again, this time saying ""I hope ALL children of America will stand with Tweek in saying 'GO AHEAD AND BOMB US, KIM JONG DONG, WE FUCKING DARE YOU!'"""
315,21,2,Tweek Tweak,[freaking out] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
316,21,2,Gary Borkovec,Hey guys. Take a minute to read about distracted driving? [a passing boy takes a flier]
317,21,2,Lola,Talk to all the grownups you know about staying off their mobile devices when they get behind the wheel.
318,21,2,Gary Borkovec,Hey guys. Got a second to help stop distracted driving? [another boy takes a flier] Thanks.
319,21,2,Lola,Hey guys- [music begins to play over the intercom]
320,21,2,Eric Cartman,"[over the intercom] Hey guys, let's take a minute and talk about suicide prevention. There's probably someone right now at this school thinkin' about killing himself, and it's not funny! [kids in the hallway stop to listen] You'd better take him serious, or he might actually do it. [all of a sudden jumps into view dressed in blue jeans and a hoodie and starts singing]

I've been feelin' sad, I've been bein' sad,
Can't talk to my mom, don't even have a dad.
I can't go on. What is livin' for?
My heart screams ""I DON'T WANNA LIVE NO MORE!""
[joined by a chorus of kids that are prerecorded on a boombox]
Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
I don't wanna live no more, no more, no more, no more.
[walks up to a boy and uses him as a ventriloquist puppet]
But Eric, we don't want you to die.
You're so kewl, we'd be sad at school.
[walks away and goes back to his normal voice]
Yeah, but you guys, you don't understand.
With my girlfriend, it's like I'm livin' in quicksand
Conflicting thoughts, I need a battered wife shelter.
My girlfriend is messed up, but all I wanna do is help her.
I'm suffocatin', I'm drowning in sorrow.
Gonna kill myself, probably around 2:30 tomorrow.
[with chorus]
But Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Give life a try.
[solo] Everybody!
[chorus a Capella] Eric, we don't want you to die, Eric. Oh God no, Eric.
But it's so hard!
Eric, we don't want you to die


Only you guys can make a difference. I don't care if you're black, white, gay, straight, or trans, I am going to kill myself unless you all start taking it seriously!


Eric, please don't die


[no one says a word. Cartman walks up to the Distracted Driving group] Distracted driving my asshole. [drops the mic and walks away with a mischievous smile]"
321,21,2,Richard Tweak,Hey Tweek.
322,21,2,Tweek Tweak,AAH! [drops the spinner]
323,21,2,Richard Tweak,How's it going with the fidget spinner?
324,21,2,Tweek Tweak,"Greeaat. [picks up the spinner and spins it again, only to see it fly off his hand a second later.]"
325,21,2,Richard Tweak,You seem a lot less anxious. Things are finally turning around for my little homosexual son. [a loud rocket sound is heard overhead.]
326,21,2,Tweek Tweak,What is that??
327,21,2,Richard Tweak,I'm not sure.
328,21,2,Tweek Tweak,[runs outside to look around.] D'aaah! [finally locates the origin of the sound and looks up to see a North Korean missile flying over the town] D'aaah! [runs back into the house and turns on the TV]
329,21,2,Anchor 4,No agreement has been reached between the parties involved. [Breaking News logo pops up] Breaking news now out of Colorado where the North Koreans appeared to have fired a missile over Tweek's house. [a small picture of him appears on the right side of the screen]
330,21,2,Tweek Tweak,D'aahaahaah!
331,21,2,Anchor 4,"Tweek, of course, the young boy who got the attention of Kim Jong-un last week. The news media in North Korea is calling the missile test a victory for its people. [what follows is actual footage of a Korean woman giving a speech]"
332,21,2,Translator,"Today, the great country of North Korea has proven its determination and fortitude by successfully firing a missile over Tweek's house. Perhaps now Tweek will come fight- [trails off]"
333,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Oh my God! Oh my God! Why is this happening to me?! They have to know that this isn't my fault!
334,21,2,Anchor 4,"In response to the North Korean test, the President of the United States has just tweeted this statement: ""You really think Tweek is scared? Tweek will single handedly go to North Korea and fuck ALL you slanty-eyed bitches doggy style."""
335,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Whaaat?! Why would he say that?!
336,21,2,Anchor 4,"The President also tweeted, ""...if you even think Tweek is worried about a bunch of dipshit, poor-ass, third world rice pickers...think again!"""
337,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Oh my God! What is he doing?!
338,21,2,Richard Tweak,"[rushes up to him with the fidget spinner and a cup of coffee] Tweek, Tweek, calm down. [puts his coffee on the sofa and tries to give the spinner to Tweek]"
339,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Why won't he just stop? Why?!
340,21,2,Richard Tweak,"Tweek, Tweek. [takes the remote control from Tweek's hand and lets it fall to the floor] Here, here's your fidget spinner."
341,21,2,Tweek Tweak,Why does he keep making it worse?!
342,21,2,Richard Tweak,"Fidget spinner, Tweek! Come on, son! [Tweek lets out a couple of grunts, and Richard responds with a soothing voice] Focus on the fidget spinner."
343,21,2,Driver 1,"Aww, Jeez, looks like North Korea launched another missile."
344,21,2,Wife,"Oh, really? Like another test? Where are you looking?"
345,21,2,Driver 1,I'm on Drudge. You see what the President tweeted about it?
346,21,2,Wife,"No, what'd he say?"
347,21,2,Driver 1,"President tweeted, ""North Korea is the butt hole of Asia and-"""
348,21,2,Wife,[sees Gary crossing the street] Innocent child!!
349,21,2,Driver 1,Baaaah! [Gary looks right as the car speeds towards him holds up his arms. The car slams into him.]
350,21,3,Eric Cartman,[runs through the hallway] This is an outrage! This is a violation of our human rights! [stops in front of Stan and Kyle]
351,21,3,Stan Marsh,What the hell is going on?
352,21,3,Eric Cartman,You didn't hear the announcement? They just cancelled Columbus Day! We have to come to school on Monday!
353,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,They what??
354,21,3,Butters Stotch,"[runs up between Stan, Kyle, and Cartman] They can't do this! We made plans! [runs off]"
355,21,3,Eric Cartman,Some asshole went and convinced the school board that Columbus Day is racist and should be eliminated!
356,21,3,Butters Stotch,[returns] You can't take away a day off! We're just innocent children!
357,21,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what asshole would take away a holiday?"
358,21,3,Peter Galtman,"My name is Peter Galtman. I am the head of the school calendar committee. [the people he's addressing are the parents and faculty of South Park Elementary] I've decided that school will not celebrate Columbus Day this year. I realize this is a hot-button issue for many families, but one parent in particular has really swayed my opinion with his passion. Mr. Randy Marsh. Mr. Marsh pointed out to me the hypocrisy of glorifying a genocidal murderer, and Mr. Marsh is right now also working on having the Columbus statue taken down in Canyon City."
359,21,3,Randy Marsh,"[runs up to the statue] Come on, everybody! Let's take this fuckin' thing down! [kicks it and punches it] Yeah, yehah! [punches it some more, with no effect] Take it down! Columbus was a mass murderer! [people gather to watch as Randy climbs up to the statue's head] Tear it down! Tear it down! Yeah! [grunts as he tries to take it apart] Hey, it's not working. [tugs at the head and grunts] We almost got it, guys! Come on, throw the rope, Stan! [a rope flies up towards him, with noose ready to go. He catches it and wraps it around the head] Good, that's good! Hit the gas, Nelson! [Peter Nelson pulls away with the rope tied to his car] We got it, everybody! To hell with you, Columbus! You guh-whoa! Whoa! [the statue topples to the right and falls apart. Randy falls with it, but isn't hurt]"
360,21,3,Stan Marsh,Hey dude.
361,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Did you know it's your dad did who's getting the school to cancel Columbus Day?
362,21,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Dude, I don't know what's going on. He's really serious about this."
363,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, you've gotta do something. If you get him to back down, maybe the school will reconsider."
364,21,3,Stan Marsh,I can't get him to back down.
365,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, I have to deal with my mom doing shit like this all the time, but she's never tried to take away a holiday. I'm your best friend, but I can't have your back when the guys find out about this."
366,21,3,Stan Marsh,"I'll try, okay. [glances up for a moment] Ok-I, I gotta go. [Randy walks up with his laptop and phone and sits next to Stan]"
367,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Okay, Stan, you got your phone? I need to call everyone on this list. They all live in the same city."
368,21,3,Stan Marsh,"Dad, listen: you need to ease off a little here."
369,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Stan, it's not right that people celebrate a man who wiped out millions of people for his own glory! [puts his phone up to his right ear] Let's go! [places his first call] Hello? Is this uh [checks his laptop screen] Howard Peterson? You live in Columbus, Ohio, is that correct? Yeah? You racist piece of shit. You heard me. You're an intolerant pig. Oh, you're not? You just choose to live in a city named for ethnic cleansing. No, fuck you! Rename your city, asshole! Hello? [evidently, the recipient hung up] Okay, next one, come on. Get calling, Stan!"
370,21,3,Stan Marsh,"Dad, come on. We all get your point, but don't you think you're overdoing it?"
371,21,3,Randy Marsh,"You have to overdo it in today's society Stan. You can't be nuanced and subtle anymore or else critics go ""Wow, what was the point of that?"" [places the next calls] Hi, Francis Melman? Hey, how are you, you fuckin' racist?"
372,21,3,Field Reporter,"[the camera zooms out to include him] Christopher Columbus. Explorer, pioneer. Is he someone who should be appreciated, or was he just a douche? For years, Columbus Circle has been a landmark and photogenic intersection in New York City. So it came as a surprise when someone defecated on the statue earlier today. I'm joined now by the man who did the actual defecating, Mr. Randy Marsh of South Park, Colorado. [walks up to Randy, who's wearing an ""I poop on New York"" T-shirt, ""poop on"" replaced by a small picture of him pooping on ""New York""]"
373,21,3,Randy Marsh,Good evening.
374,21,3,Field Reporter,"Mr. Marsh, you took a dump on a beloved statue that's been an icon here in the city for years. What was your reasoning?"
375,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Well, I just have a problem with the racist people of this city. Yeehaw, [gets into a hick, redneck accent] I'm from New York! I drive around a big circle n' celebrates a guy who murdered Native Americans! Shoowee!"
376,21,3,Field Reporter,So you're doing this because of indigenous peoples and their feelings.
377,21,3,Randy Marsh,"I don't care if people get indigenous, I'll crap all over their statues! I'm the one who's indigenous that this landmark even exists!"
378,21,3,Field Reporter,"Aah, aaah, bah, back to you, Tom."
379,21,3,Butters Stotch,It ain't right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away your one day off in October like you're a piece of trash!
380,21,3,Stan Marsh,[shows up at table with his lunch] Hey guys. [takes a seat between Token and Jimmy]
381,21,3,Eric Cartman,"Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan!"
382,21,3,Stan Marsh,"Look, I tried talking to him, alright? He's just really against all the things Columbus did."
383,21,3,Jimmy Valmer,Does anyone know what Columbus actually did?
384,21,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That's what matters."
385,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No! No, wait guys. Maybe that's it. When I'm dealing with my mom, sometimes it works to be on her side for a minute. Maybe we should find out all the things people find offensive about Columbus and-"
386,21,3,Eric Cartman,"And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle."
387,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I'll just look up Columbus, offensive, inflammatory-"
388,21,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet. It's like that movie where the dude pretended to be on the monsters' side? You know, with the guy and the chick that had the wife beater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them? [Kyle checks the search results]"
389,21,3,Butters Stotch,I love that movie.
390,21,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this is a lot like that. What'd you find, Kyle?"
391,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,Nnnothing.
392,21,3,Butters Stotch,Dang it! There's nothing?
393,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, can I talk to you for a minute? [leaves the table, and Stan follows]"
394,21,3,Eric Cartman,[now out of the loop] What? What? What the hell was that?
395,21,3,Stan Marsh,Hey Dad?
396,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Not now, Stan. I'm working on a proposal to change British Columbia to just British."
397,21,3,Stan Marsh,"But Dad, Kyle found a picture on Instagram. [shows Randy the pictures] It pretty much looks like you dressed as Columbus at a Halloween party. [Randy notices the picture, now shown close up]"
398,21,3,Randy Marsh,Where did you get that?
399,21,3,Stan Marsh,"If you hate Columbus so much, why did you dress like him?"
400,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Look, that was a long time ago, okay? It's just a dumb Halloween costume."
401,21,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah but, [goes through the pictures he pulled off Instagram] here's you dressed as Columbus at a formal dinner, and here's you dressed as Columbus at a football game, and you as Columbus on St. Patrick's Day..."
402,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Look, I was younger! We were all... younger. It was another time. You have to understand, it was 2013. Everyone was stoked on Columbus back then."
403,21,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but Dad, you seem to be really stoked on Columbus."
404,21,3,Randy Marsh,"If you guys found those pictures online, it's only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won't care about what I do now. They'll just see me as a thoughtless, indigenous son of a bitch."
405,21,3,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, do you mind cleaning out the garage like I asked?"
406,21,3,Randy Marsh,"[moping] What's the point, Sharon? Soon they're gonna be coming after me."
407,21,3,Sharon Marsh,Ach. [turns around and walks away]
408,21,3,Announcer,"[a series of faces appear on tv, and Randy is interested] Hey, you! That's right, you! Wouldn't you like to know the story of you? What makes you you? DNAandMe is a genetic service that can help you find out exactly who your ancestors were. You might be surprised."
409,21,3,Cyclist,"[at Santa Monica Beach, stops] I thought I was just a standard white guy, but DNAandMe showed that I'm actually 4.2% Cherokee Indian."
410,21,3,Woman 1,[doing curls] Turns out I'm not totally white. I'm also part Northern Asian and even some Kurdish. I'm a victim of oppression. [smiles]
411,21,3,Steve,[seated at his desk] I used to get in trouble for always using the N word. But with DNAandMe I found out that I'm 2.1% black.
412,21,3,Office Worker,"[walks by] 'Morning, Steve?"
413,21,3,Steve,"Sup, nigga? [smiles]"
414,21,3,Announcer,"The test is easy. [a woman is shown swabbing her mouth for a DNA sample and putting it into a cuvette, then sealing that cuvette] Simply swab the inside of your mouth and send it into our lab."
415,21,3,Driver,"[behind the wheel] People made fun of me for being French. DNAandMe showed I was 8% Navajo. Nobody's makin' fun of me now, or my people, who are victims."
416,21,3,Female Jogger,I'm 13% victim.
417,21,3,Painter,I'm 21% victim.
418,21,3,Announcer,Order now and find out if your friends should be more sympathetic towards you. DNAandMe. Are you in?
419,21,3,Randy Marsh,Hell fucking yes I'm in.
420,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Alright, everyone's here. Let's do this. [in the room with him is a Native American (Bill), whom he walks up to. He opens a desk drawer and pulls out some money] Here you go, just like I said. A hundred dollars cash. No questions asked. Are we good? [Bill just looks him over] Good. No talking. Perfect. Okay, let's get this over with. [pulls Bill's face towards his own and gives him a long, passionate French kiss. Bill gets more and more surprised the longer the kiss continues. Randy suddenly stops the kiss] Thank you. Do not talk of this to anyone. [Bill just turns to watch him leave]"
421,21,3,Randy Marsh,"All right, everybody. Hey, thanks for comin'. If uh-I can have your attention, please? I think we're ready to get started."
422,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"[holding a DNAandMe kit] Ahah, Mr. Marsh, you know, none of this was really necessary. For DNAandMe testing you can just swab the inside of your mouth yourself and send it in the mail."
423,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I know, but I just, I was really excited, wanted everyone to witness my test."
424,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Well, to each their own I suppose. [opens the kit and pulls out a swab] All right, open wide. [Randy opens up and hums as the DNAandMe doctor moves the swab around the inside of his cheek. A shot of the Tuckers and Nelson eating hors d'oeuvres. The doctor takes the swab and puts it back in the kit] Okay, I'll get this back to the lab and get the results to you as quickly as possible."
425,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Okay, great. I'm very interested to see [begins speaking more slowly] what those results have to say."
426,21,3,Peter Galtman,[answers the phone] Galtman residence.
427,21,3,Masked voice,Listen to me carefully. The man who convinced you to cancel Columbus Day is a fraud.
428,21,3,Mr Galtman,Who is this?
429,21,3,Masked voice,You will go online and search Instagram for images of Randy Marsh.
430,21,3,Mr Galtman,I most certainly will not!
431,21,3,Masked voice,"Randy Marsh is a hypocrite and a fake. You will be taken down with him when he is exposed! [a shot of the boys' restroom at school. Kenny is the one who's masking his voice as Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look on]"
432,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,What's he saying?
433,21,3,Kenny McCormick,(Shhh! Don't interrupt!) [masked voice again] We know where you live and we know how to make you suffer!
434,21,3,Mr Galtman,"Now you listen here, Mr. Man! The Galtmans don't believe in social media or the Internet! It's all fake news!"
435,21,3,Mrs Galtman,Fake news.
436,21,3,Kenny McCormick,"[masked voice] Then speak with Marsh yourself! The truth is out there! [hangs up] (Well, I don't know if that worked.)"
437,21,3,Mr Galtman,Hm. [suspicion aroused] Sounds like maybe the Galtmans need to check out Randy Marsh.
438,21,3,Randy Marsh,Shelly! We've got an emergency! We're getting rid of all the Columbus stuff in this house! Any Columbus costumes? Columbus pictures? They all gotta go!
439,21,3,Shelly Marsh,I don't give a shit about Columbus.
440,21,3,Randy Marsh,Sharon! Peter Galtman called! He sounds suspicious! We've gotta get rid of all our Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups! Where are they?!
441,21,3,Sharon Marsh,YOUR Columbus shot glasses and coffee cups are in that cupboard.
442,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Shot, shot glasses, coffee cups, towels, plates. What about the Columbus figurine salt and pepper shakers?"
443,21,3,Sharon Marsh,"I don't know where YOU put them, Randy."
444,21,3,Randy Marsh,"[walks from the cupboard to the sink] Sharon, do you know what they'll do to us when they find out how we were so stoked on Columbus??"
445,21,3,Sharon Marsh,"YOU were stoked on Columbus, Randy. Not me."
446,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Oho, really?! Did you forget our wedding?! That's you, right there! [shows her the wedding picture. She's in a traditional wedding dress while Randy is dressed as Columbus] Standing there with a big smile on your face! You didn't say anything about it being insensitive then, did you?!"
447,21,3,Sharon Marsh,"I actually was a little upset that you dressed up as Columbus for our wedding, but I decided-"
448,21,3,Randy Marsh,"[moves from her right side to her left] Oh, NOW! You say that NOW 'cause everyone's freakin' out, but you were right there going along with it! [turns around and walks away, but turns around again] They're gonna be coming after you too, Sharon! So you can just wipe that indigenous look off your face! [the doorbell rings and Sharon's eyebrows rise up. Randy perks up] Oh! That could be my DNA results! Here, take this stuff out back! [drops it all next to Sharon and runs to the front door, only to find Bill at the door with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. Randy looks him over, and Bill gives him the bouquet] Oh... nooo, nonononono."
449,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,I've never felt so alive until now.
450,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Thank you. Lo-lovely flowers. Thank, thank you. [shuts the door on the bouquet, which is crushed and falls apart]"
451,21,3,Mr Galtman,[answers the phone] Galtman residence.
452,21,3,Kenny McCormick,[masked voice] Listen carefully if you want to live. You will make this Monday a school holiday.
453,21,3,Mr Galtman,I spoke with Mr. Marsh and he denied any wrongdoing.
454,21,3,Kenny McCormick,[talking from the boys' bathroom at school] Of course he did! That's what liars do!
455,21,3,Stan Marsh,I don't think you're being intimidating enough.
456,21,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, get meaner, Kenny."
457,21,3,Kenny McCormick,"Meaner like now, dude?"
458,21,3,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, like, like uh, maybe say-"
459,21,3,Eric Cartman,Just talk about cutting off his dick or something.
460,21,3,Kenny McCormick,[to Galtman] We're gonna cut off your dick!
461,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, that's too far."
462,21,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off part of his dick."
463,21,3,Stan Marsh,Just give me the phone! Hello!
464,21,3,Mr Galtman,What?
465,21,3,Stan Marsh,Randy Marsh is about to pay for what he's done! [shown on the phone] Protect him and you will pay too! Time is running out! [hangs up] Jesus!
466,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, have you seen my Columbus staff and orb?"
467,21,3,Sharon Marsh,I have not. [Randy goes to the closet and start rifling through it]
468,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, Galtman called again. Somebody's out there trying to get me in trouble!"
469,21,3,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, why don't you just admit to people that maybe you were somewhat overly excited about Columbus in the past?"
470,21,3,Randy Marsh,Everyone was excited about Columbus! For some reason people are just pointing fingers at me! Just because he's suddenly not cool now doesn't mean I'm gonna be the effin' scapegoat! [leaves the room and closes the door]
471,21,3,Randy Marsh,I've gotta burn this stuff! [opens the door and sees Bill waiting for him with a drum and stick] Oh Goddamnit!
472,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,I wrote you a song to express my feelings for you.
473,21,3,Randy Marsh,Will you get out of here?!
474,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,"[bangs on the drum and chants, then] And then he kissed me."
475,21,3,Randy Marsh,[hushed] I didn't kiss you 'cause I liked you!
476,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,"[ignores him, bangs on the drum and chants, then] And then he kissed me."
477,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Okay, okay"
478,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,"[bangs on the drum and chants, then] And the sun began to shine."
479,21,3,Randy Marsh,That's it! Get off my property! [turns him around and shoves him towards the sidewalk]
480,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,"Randy, I cannot quit you."
481,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Get off my land, you piece of shit! [kicks him to the curb]"
482,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,Uuugh! [they both look around. Randy sees a jogger across the street with his phone]
483,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Don't post that. [a few seconds pass] Do not. Post that. [the jogger takes off. Randy drops the staff and orb, and gives chase] Shit!"
484,21,3,Eric Cartman,"Guys, what are you going?"
485,21,3,Butters Stotch,"It's over, Eric. We have to come to school on Monday. Just face it."
486,21,3,Eric Cartman,I'm not facing anything. We still have time. There has to be a way-
487,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, there's nothing we can do, all right?"
488,21,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh okay. I see. Is that what Columbus did? Just give up? On his dream? No! Columbus believed that kids should have a day off skewl! And even when his own country wouldn't support his cause, Columbus said ""Fine! I'll go find a new land, where kids can have that day off!"""
489,21,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Eric, just l-let it go."
490,21,3,Eric Cartman,"And when Columbus sailed to distant places only to find people already there who said ""No! Stay off our land! We want our kids to have to go to skewl!"", he said ""No! It's just one day in October! They need a break!""

You guys can all give up, but I'm not.
Because in 1492, Columbus got us all a day off skewl.
With just three ships he sailed over so we could have some me time in October.
And yes, millions were slaughtered and throats were cut
But if we don't get that day off of school, then... for what?"
491,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, guys. [stands up on the merry-go-round] There's something else we can try."
492,21,3,Randy Marsh,"[excited] Sharon, good news!"
493,21,3,Sharon Marsh,What??
494,21,3,Randy Marsh,The people from the DNA test called. They're on their way over. You wanna come down?
495,21,3,Sharon Marsh,I'm doing something.
496,21,3,Randy Marsh,"You sure? These results could be really interesting. [Sharon stays quiet, so he heads downstairs]"
497,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Oh Goddammit, what the hell do you want?"
498,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,I want you to stop running from yourself. We could be so happy. [the doorbell rings]
499,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Crap, it's them! [to the front door] Just a second, be right there. Thanks! [turns around and shoves Bill towards the back door] Get over here! I don't have any feelings for you. Do you understand?!"
500,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,"But Randy, what about the-"
501,21,3,Randy Marsh,[shoves him out the back door] NO! No buts! There is nothing here! I'm not in love with you! Got it?!
502,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,"Yes. Yes, I understand."
503,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Good! Now leave! [goes to the front door, and lets the DNAandMe folks in] Hi, sorry. You guys have my results?"
504,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Well, Mr. Marsh, we came because there was an irregularity with your test."
505,21,3,Randy Marsh,Well what? You found something there you didn't expect to find? What is it?
506,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,Well it's just a little too odd. We need to do the test again.
507,21,3,Randy Marsh,Do it again? That's not fair.
508,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Mr. Marsh, please. If we could have one more sample. We want to be absolutely sure of what we found."
509,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Agh-uh oh, okay, no problem. [begins to back up] Give me, give me one sec. I'll be right back. [turns and runs to the back door, opens it, and runs out] Wait! [looks to his left] Wait! [runs up to the Native American and kisses him in the mouth again, and just as before, stops and leaves, this time to go back inside and to the living room] Okay! Okay, all set. Let's do this. Aaaaa-"
510,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Mr. Marsh, we were hoping to do a more precise test. It's better for harder cases like this, but... it is an anal swab this time. [prepares the kit]"
511,21,3,Randy Marsh,"An anal swab? Give me tuh, three minutes. [backs up and runs out the back door again, looking for the Native American.] Hey, where'd you go? [the doctor walks up behind him and puts his right hand on Randy's shoulder]"
512,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Mr. Marsh, we're in a bit of a hurry, if you don't mind. [pulls him back inside]"
513,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Oh, aw shit. [the assistant closes the door]"
514,21,3,Eric Cartman,"[wearing a horse head mask] All right, it's clear. Bring him in. [Stan, wearing a pig head mask, and Kyle, wearing a rabbit head mask, pull Mr. Galtman inside]"
515,21,3,Kenny McCormick,"[wearing a pigeon head mask, using his Mysterion voice] Move your ass, Galtman!"
516,21,3,Mr Galtman,This is a violation of my rights.
517,21,3,Stan Marsh,"Just shut up, and watch what someone posted on their Instagram!"
518,21,3,Mr Galtman,"I most certainly will not! If you want me to look at the Internet, I will die first. It's fake news!"
519,21,3,Kyle Broflovski,[as Stan puts a tape into the VCR] That's why we had it transferred to VHS.
520,21,3,Mr Galtman,"Oh, VHS is fine."
521,21,3,Kenny McCormick,"Take off his blindfold. [Kyle does so. Stan presses play, and the scene of Randy kicking the Native American to the curb is shown]"
522,21,3,Mr Galtman,Hmmm...
523,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Oh, Mr. Marsh."
524,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, ha-hay. [turns around] How are you? [smiles nervously]"
525,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,Good. Wha-what are you up to?
526,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Chillin', chillin'."
527,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Well, uhhh, we did get your DNA results back this morning. Would you like to go over them?"
528,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Oh, you did? Oh, great. Sure, why not? Uh, I'm here. Huh let's uh, let's do that."
529,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"N'all right Mr. Marsh, here's your DNAandMe portfolio. [starts the presentation] This shows that we actually found a mix of a few things in you regional ancestry."
530,21,3,Randy Marsh,"[jumps up and stands] Really? Like Native American? Like a, like a little bit?"
531,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Nno, we didn't find any trace of any Native American DNA in your test."
532,21,3,Randy Marsh,Nnnuts! [sits down]
533,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"But as you can see here [click], we found that you are about 43% Northern European, 37% Mediterranean, and 18% Southwest Asian. In fact, your genetic profile most closely matches [clicks] your standard Caucasian British person."
534,21,3,Randy Marsh,[sighing] Awww.
535,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"And, you might be interested to know that you're actually 2.8% Neanderthal, which is fairly high."
536,21,3,Randy Marsh,Neander-thal? What the hell is that about?
537,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Well, the Neanderthals were actually a species that was wiped out by Homo sapiens."
538,21,3,Randy Marsh,Wiped out? All of my people?
539,21,3,DNA Test Administrator,"Yes, but you see, because of some cross-breeding, some people like you still possess Neanderthal DNA. Isn't that interesting?"
540,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Cross-breeding? You mean rape. You're telling me that my ancestors were raped, and then eradicated by you? You maniacs! [kicks the chair out of the way] The earth wasn't big enough for Neanderthals, so your ancestors just got rid of them, huh?! Well TO HELL WITH ALL OF YOU!! [knocks over a tool cart and leaves]"
541,21,3,Mr Galtman,"Well well, Mr. Marsh. I'd like to have a word, please."
542,21,3,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to him and punches him out with one blow] You find this funny, Galtman!"
543,21,3,Mr Galtman,What'd I do?
544,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Nobody had the guts to tell me what happened to my people, huh? Get the hell out of here! [opens the front door and Bill is back]"
545,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,I brought my parents over so you could meet them.
546,21,3,Randy Marsh,Waww God!
547,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,Don't worry. My parents are very okay and cool with us.
548,21,3,Stan Marsh,Who the hell is that?
549,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, sure! Everyone gang up on the Neanderthal! Isn't it funny!"
550,21,3,Bill Yellow Hawk,"Randy, you must face who you are. Stop pretending, Randy. For once, just allow yourself to feel."
551,21,3,Randy Marsh,"[moves away from the others] You're right. [Galtman stands up and they all look at Randy again] You're right. It's only now, when everyone is being so indigenous to me, that I realized... how indigenous I've been acting all along. I thought being a victim would solve all my problems. But being a victim has a down side too. [walks up to Galtman] Mr. Galtman, I haven't been honest. It's time for us all... to be honest."
552,21,3,Randy Marsh,"What is a holiday? It's a day off work, yes. A day off school. But holidays are also meant to be a time to reflect. Today, I'm happy to announce that the school calendar committee is reinstating the day off. [the kids cheer] But instead of glorifying anyone, Let us make it a holiday about the negative feelings that we all sometimes feel. Say what we're really thinking so we can move on. And so, the second Monday in October will still be a holiday, but instead of Columbus Day, it will be for ripping on each other and tearing each other down. And we will call it Indigenous Peoples Day. For perhaps if we all do it at the same time, we won't be so indigenous the rest of the year. And since this is the second Monday of October, let's all embrace the new meaning of the holiday starting right now."
553,21,3,Dave,"Do you even know what indigenous means, you freakin' idiot?!"
554,21,3,Randy Marsh,"That's the spirit, Dave. Come on, everybody, let's just all be totally indigenous. Come on!"
555,21,3,Kurt,Who the hell let this guy talk to the school council?
556,21,3,Randy Marsh,"Good one Kurt. Your wife's a whore. Come on, everyone! Indigenous People's Day! Let's go for it!"
557,21,3,Woman 2,Shut up and get off the podium! [people begin to leave]
558,21,4,Man 1,What on Earth was that?
559,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,"[voice over] My name is Jimmy Valmer. [He zips around town, startling people here and there. Two boys playing basketball almost lose it when he zips by them] And I am very... [stops] f-f-fast. [General Medical Center, day] When I was born, my parents knew I was different."
560,21,4,Doctor,"[handing baby Jimmy to his parents] I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Valmer, your newborn son will never be able to walk. But he will be extremely good at comedy. [Sarah cries as she uncovers his face]"
561,21,4,Baby Jimmy,[already with a mic in his hand] Wow! What a teh-t-teh-terrific audience. [Sarah sobs some more]
562,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,"[voice over] As I got older, my powers only increased."
563,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,[on stage] What do you call cheese that isn't yours?
564,21,4,Woman 1,AAAAHHHH Help! [Jimmy zips away and returns moments later with a pickpocket tied up next to him]
565,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,Nacho cheese. [gets a round of applause]
566,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,"[voice over] And now I look for others like me to fight crime as part of a superhero team. I am... Fas... Fastpass! [shown to be auditioning for a role in a superhero team headed by... The Coon. The current team members - Tupperware (Token), Mosquito (Clyde), The Coon (Cartman), Toolshed (Stan), Human Kite (Kyle), and Mysterion (Kenny) - clap approvingly]"
567,21,4,Cartman,"[The Coon] Okay, okay, thank you, Fastpass. What do you guys think?"
568,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,We definitely don't have anyone with superhuman speed in our franchise.
569,21,4,Token Black/Tupperware,"Fastpass, what makes you feel... qualified to be part of our cinematic universe?"
570,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,"Well, besides being super f-f-fa-fast, I also have a good attitude, and flexibility with my schedule on weekends."
571,21,4,Cartman,"Fastpass, welcome to Coon and Friends. You are about to make a shitload of money."
572,21,4,Cartman,"Alright, superheros, it's time to lay out our plan of action. As you can see, I have divided the franchise plan into three phases. Phase 1 begins with The Coon Netflix series and goes through the Coon and Friends United movie, where we introduce Toolshed and The Human Kite. In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito."
573,21,4,Clyde Donovan/Mosquito,"Bzzz oh boy, I get my own origin movie, bzzz?"
574,21,4,Cartman,"That's right. It's in Phase 2 that we introduce Tupperware, our black superhero, like an ace in the hole."
575,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,"Whoawhoa wait, how come we gotta start off with a Netflix series? Can't we just go right into movies?"
576,21,4,Cartman,"Netflix is starving for new shows right now, Toolshed. They will literally buy anything people pitch them. We need to strike while the iron's hot. Later in Phase 3 we can finally get to Civil War, where we will all- [the Coon alarm goes off and the boys look around]"
577,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,What is it?
578,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,Incoming Face Time call from Super Craig. [the boys leave their seats and gather around the monitor]
579,21,4,Cartman,Onscreen!
580,21,4,Craig Tucker/Super Craig,"You guys, we have a big problem."
581,21,4,Cartman,"What is it, Super Craig?"
582,21,4,Craig Tucker/Super Craig,"Somebody's messing with our Facebook page. They're spreading all these lies, saying we like, burn the American flag and pee in each other's mouths."
583,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,Spreading lies how?
584,21,4,Craig Tucker/Super Craig,Take a look. [holds up a picture of a mysterious boy and the Coon and Friends Facebook page] Someone is systematically targeting our Facebook followers and feeding them misinformation.
585,21,4,Cartman,Who would deliberately use Facebook in such a horribly reckless way?
586,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"[opens the bedroom door to check in] Butters, you're not looking at boobies again, are you?"
587,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"No Dad, I'm not looking at boobies. [Stephen closes the door and Butters waits a few second before cackling again] Waahahahahaha!"
588,21,4,Cartman,Butters?!
589,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Oh, hey fellas."
590,21,4,Cartman,"Butters, are you using Facebook to fuck with our superhero franchise?"
591,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Uuuuuuummm, nope. [turns around and walks off, the others wait a second or two before catching up]"
592,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,Butters? Butters!
593,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"[turns around] Yes, fellas?"
594,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,"Dude, listen. We don't have time for this. Right now, Netflix is buying any show that people pitch them. We have a real shot at starting our franchise, and you are a part of that franchise plan, okay? We have movies planned for the bad guy."
595,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,You mean like Suicide Squad?
596,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,Yes!
597,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,[in Stan's face] Suicide Squad sucked! [turns around and walks off again]
598,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,Butters! Butters! You can't just make stuff up about us! [Butters turns around again] People are thinking it's true!
599,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Look fellas, you have a right to be on facebook and I have a right to be on facebook. And sometimes that's going to cause a little... [makes a fist and smirks] CHAOS. [looks mischievous and gets slick] Gotta get to classss."
600,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,"Dude, what a dick!"
601,21,4,Cartman,"If we don't find a way to stop him, we're never gonna make any money, you guys."
602,21,4,Ryan Valmer,"Thanks for coming, everyone. I know you are all concerned as Sarah and I are about what's happening to our children."
603,21,4,Thomas Tucker,I just... can't believe that children in our town are dressing up in hero costumes and peeing in each other's mouths.
604,21,4,Randy Marsh,And who are these kids? Does anyone know? They're wearing capes and forcing objects into their own rectal cavities? Why?
605,21,4,Steve Black,We [referring to himself and Linda] were shocked to read that a young African-American boy is wearing Tupperware and defecating on girls while they sleep. What if those kids are hanging out with our kids?
606,21,4,Stephen Stotch,You know what I think the problem is? Facebook.
607,21,4,Randy Marsh,Facebook? How so?
608,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"Well, look, we all know there's a lot of mixing of truth and fiction that's been on Facebook lately, and children lack the cognitive ability to determine what's true and what isn't on Facebook. That's why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes, eating poop, and having sex with antelopes in our town."
609,21,4,Thomas Tucker,Maybe we need to get our kids off of Facebook.
610,21,4,Randy Marsh,That'll never happen. You know what I say we do? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg to come and talk to us all about our concerns in this community.
611,21,4,Linda Stotch,Do you really think he'd come?
612,21,4,Stephen Stotch,Why not give it a try? Let's invite Mark Zuckerberg here and see what he has to say? I'm sure he's a reasonable person. [takes a sip]
613,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,[as Professor Chaos] Who are you?! What do you want?!
614,21,4,Adam Borque,I'm here about the job? [points to the flyer]
615,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Oh. Are you Adam? Well, come on in. [Adam walks in with Butters and Butters closes the door. Butters gives him a tour of the place] You're making a smart career choice, Adam. You see, what we do here is utilize Facebook not only to spread chaos, but to actually profit from it. You'll find the hours very reasonable and I'm working on getting full health and dental for all employees. [stops and gets a uniform off the shelves for Adam] Here's your company uniform. You see, what I've done, Adam, is build a completely self-sustaining Chaos machine [Adam exits the boys room as Chaos #28] - You look fantastic - doing nothing more than what Facebook was designed to do. I make money from Facebook for my fake content in order to pay Facebook to promote my fake stories. And thusly we're growing bigger every day. Everyone, can I have your attention please? [the other workers look towards them] We have a new agent in Chaos. Please welcome Adam Borque. [the others clap for him] Here you go. You can take this workstation, Adam. Just start writing horrible things about people and presenting it as reality on Facebook. Alright! Don't forget we have a Chaos quota, gang! Let's really fuck shit up! [the workers resume their work]"
616,21,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh, alright, can everyone hear me in the back? Hm'kay, we're gonna get started here. I know you all have a lot of questions, so without further ado, let me introduce Mark Zuckerberg. [Zuckerberg walks up] Thanks for coming, Mr. Zuckerberg."
617,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,[in a stilted manner. He speaks like this throughout the episode] Thank you. It is a great honor to be here amongst all of you. [immediately you can see his lips don't match his words]
618,21,4,Mr Mackey,"For those of you who don't know uh, could you tell us who you are?"
619,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,I am the founder and chairman of Facebook. But I also have a shtoile that is completely unblockable.
620,21,4,Mr Mackey,"Okay, we'll let him speak and then we'll uh open the floor to some questions if there's time, thank you."
621,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"Thank you, right? [Mr. Mackey walks off] Alright, everyone here wants to see my shtoile. But first, what I'll need is a volunteer. Yes, you sir."
622,21,4,Man 2,"Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook has become a tool for some to disrupt our country and our community."
623,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"You say these things like they are my fault, and yet they are not."
624,21,4,Man 2,"Well, you did create a platform with a monetary incentive for people to spread misinformation?"
625,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I see you're trying to use your shtoile over mine. Now, you try to block me. [assumes a fighting stance, puts his left palm out as far as it can go, and makes some odd sounds] Now you've learned that you cannot block me, yehhhs? [a woman raises her arm] Yes, what is your question?"
626,21,4,Woman 2,"[stands up] How are we supposed to keep our kids-? [he interrups her with some more fighting stances and odd sounds, and she sits down]"
627,21,4,Cartman,Wilson Aubrey?
628,21,4,Wilson Aubry,Yeah.
629,21,4,Cartman,"It's us, your heroes, Coon and Friends. We're uhm, just wondering why you stopped following us on Instagram?"
630,21,4,Wilson Aubry,Because you victimize innocent people and poop in little girls' mouths.
631,21,4,Cartman,"That's not true, Wilson. We're Coon and Friends, not Harvey Weinstein."
632,21,4,Wilson Aubry,Facebook says it's true.
633,21,4,Cartman,But it's NOT true.
634,21,4,Wilson Aubry,But Facebook says it's true.
635,21,4,Cartman,"[gets in his face] Okay, but it's NOT true, and you need to have your own fucking brain and decide shit for yourself!"
636,21,4,Wilson Aubry,"AAAAH! [shuts the door on Cartman, who's taken aback. Cartman turns around and leaves the house, and the other Coon Friends follow]"
637,21,4,Cartman,God dammit! Let's just face it! We're never gonna have a superhero franchise!
638,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,It's so unfair.
639,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,"Come on, fellas. Wu-we can't let Butters win."
640,21,4,Cartman,"Forget it, Fastpass. The world hates us now."
641,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,"Yeah, nobody believes in us."
642,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,"W-we believe in each other, don't we? [the others look at him] Who cares what everyone else thinks? I joined this franchise because I believe that it can make a lot of money. And being a superhero means you keep believing in that money, no matter how hard things get!"
643,21,4,Cartman,Fastpass is right. We let all this distract us from what's important. We just need to get the Netflix series and let our superhero franchise speak for itself!
644,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,"Coon, everybody hates us."
645,21,4,Cartman,"Maybe so, but we know who we are! We are Coon Friends because we care about each other. Because we have each other's back! And when things look their darkest, these heroes will stand together! [Heidi walks up behind him] And we'll-!"
646,21,4,Heidi Turner,"Hey babe, what's up? [Cartman stands still a moment, then deflates. Several seconds later he sighs heavily a couple of times, closes his eyes, sniffle and groans, and puts his right hand over his right eye. He's at a loss for words as Heidi's smile fades] What are you up to?"
647,21,4,Cartman,"[soft voice] Nothing, just fucking wearing sweet costumes and talking about fighting evil, is that okay?"
648,21,4,Heidi Turner,I just- I thought we were meeting at the park. You didn't text or anything.
649,21,4,Cartman,"[soft voice, to himself] Oh my God, are you fucking kidding me right now?"
650,21,4,Heidi Turner,"Sorry! I won't interrupt! [turns around and walks off, Cartman watches her walk off with a concerned look on his face, then turns back to the other Coon Friends and continues his speech]"
651,21,4,Cartman,"Because we are Coon and Friends, and as long as we have each other, we can do anything!"
652,21,4,Richard Tweak,"I swear, that was the worst public speaker I've ever seen. What was Mark Zuckerberg's point?"
653,21,4,Mrs Tweak,I don't even understand what that was about.
654,21,4,Richard Tweak,Guess nobody realized that Mark Zuckerberg was such a penis.
655,21,4,Richard Tweak,What the hell?
656,21,4,Mrs Tweak,It's Mark Zuckerberg.
657,21,4,Richard Tweak,"I know who it is! [to Zuckerberg] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!"
658,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,I was invited here by people.
659,21,4,Richard Tweak,We invited you to come speak to our community about our problems!
660,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"[assumes a fighting stance] Ah, I see what you did there. Trying to block me, riiight? I'm tired of eating chips. What else is there? [makes his way to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator]"
661,21,4,Richard Tweak,Hey! Get out of our fridge!
662,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"Ha ha ha, this puny refrigerator could not block me. What makes you think you can?"
663,21,4,Richard Tweak,Now you listen here! I will not-! [Zuckerberg puts up his left arm and holds it out as if creating a force field for blocking]
664,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"Ha ha ha ha, you are no match for my shtoile."
665,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"So, where are we headed? Perhaps we should get some food."
666,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"What, eh. Excuse me, this is our car?!"
667,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,You call this a car? It wasn't even remotely able to block me. What is this car's shtoile?
668,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"Get, get out of here, ya penis."
669,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,Ha ha ha ha. You say I am a penis and yet I am not a penis.
670,21,4,Operator 1,"Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?"
671,21,4,Cartman,"[from home] Uh yes, hello. We have an idea for a show that we think would be great for Netflix."
672,21,4,Operator 1,"Okay, great. Would you like a pilot or just go straight to an order of six episodes?"
673,21,4,Cartman,We'd like to go right into six episodes with a pickup option at the end of three.
674,21,4,Operator 1,Got it. Can you start shooting next month?
675,21,4,Operator 2,Got a show about transsexual dragons here.
676,21,4,Cartman,"Yes. We are ready to start right now. We are very, very excited."
677,21,4,Operator 1,"Okay, sounds great, we'll send you the contracts. Oh, and uh, what's the show about?"
678,21,4,Cartman,It's a stand-alone series about a superhero called the Coon before he joins Coon and Friends.
679,21,4,Operator 1,"Coon and Friends? You mean, the kids I just read about in the news who stabbed Jessica Alba?"
680,21,4,Cartman,"Look, you didn't, you didn't read that on the news you read that on Facebook!"
681,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,"Aw man, here we go."
682,21,4,Operator 1,"Yeah, ah, dangit, we've never done this before, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to pass on your show."
683,21,4,Cartman,Listen to me! There are falsehoods about us on Facebook that are NOT TRUE!
684,21,4,Operator 1,"Well then, you should have those things taken down. It can't be that hard."
685,21,4,Cartman,It's a lot harder than you think!
686,21,4,Operator 1,"L-look, we'd love to approve your show, but you need to get those things cleared up first, okay? Thanks for calling. [hangs up and takes the next call] Netflix, you're greenlit. Who am I speaking with?"
687,21,4,Elderly Man,What the? Who are you?
688,21,4,Elderly Woman,I believe that's Mark Zuckerberg.
689,21,4,Elderly Man,Hey that's my soup!
690,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"[rises into a fighting stance] So, you are trying to block me, huh? That's fine. What's your shtoile?"
691,21,4,Elderly Man,I don't have a shtoile.
692,21,4,Ryan Valmer,Hey! Get out of my bed!
693,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"I was invited here. I am only making use of a bed for sleeping, yehhhs?"
694,21,4,Ryan Valmer,We just wanted you to come share your insights on Facebook!
695,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"[makes some strange motions and sounds] Oh, my head, my head. [makes more strange motions and sounds] You should have worked with me when you had the chance. Now you lie over there, dead."
696,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,Attention employees. Kelly Shmidt has just written her 100th fake blog post that was shared over a thousand times on Facebook. Let's hear it for Kelly! [the staffers clap] Don't forget about those Chaos incentives! You too can benefit from pandemonium. [smiles. Coon and Friends show up and walk through the front doors]
697,21,4,Cartman,Butters!
698,21,4,Adam Borque,"Whoa no, it's Coon and Friends! [he and the other staffers hide under their desks]"
699,21,4,Chaos 35,Oh no!
700,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Calm down, everyone. Stick to your work. I will deal with these trespassers."
701,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,"We're here to put an end to you, Chaos!"
702,21,4,Cartman,Yeah! I don't have buttsex with antelopes and Token doesn't poop in girls' mouths!
703,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"It's the 21st century, gentlemen! There's nothing illegal about what I'm doing."
704,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,Yeah? Nothing illegal about us kicking your ah...ass either.
705,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Actually, that IS illegal. And besides, you can't do anything to me. [whistles. Zuckerberg emerges from the back of the store on the second floor, flips over the balcony, and lands in front of Butters]"
706,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"Bwaaaaaa! So, this is the Coon and Friends that you have told me about. [to the Coon Friends] I warn you, my fighting shtoile is unsurpassed."
707,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,Who the ss-Sam Hell is th-that?
708,21,4,Clyde Donovan/Mosquito,I think that's Mark Zuckerberg.
709,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"You want to get to Butters, riiight? You're gonna have to get through me, huuuh?!"
710,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,"Dude, this kid is deliberately lying about us on your platform for no other reason than to cause harm! Why are you protecting him?!"
711,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,Simple. He paid me $17.23.
712,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,It's the Facebook Safeguard program. Just $17 monthly gets you personal protection from Mark Zuckerberg.
713,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,Come on! What's your shtoile?
714,21,4,Sgt Yates,"Alright, alright, everyone calm down! I can't hear over all of you. [the crowd quiets down]"
715,21,4,Stephen Stotch,You have to do something! This guy's goin' around acting like everyone's stuff is his!
716,21,4,Thomas Tucker,I'm sick of getting out of the shower to find Mark Zuckerberg sitting on my toilet!
717,21,4,Steve Black,Zuckerberg ate everything in our freezer and then helped himself to my wife's lubricant! [the crowd begins to clamor again]
718,21,4,Sgt Yates,"Alright, everyone, I just want to know one thing. Who invited him here? [the crowd falls silent] Come on. Who invited Mark Zuckerberg to town in the first place? [the folks hang their head in shame]"
719,21,4,Randy Marsh,We did. [other townsmen say the same thing]
720,21,4,Sgt Yates,Huh? What's that?
721,21,4,Randy Marsh,We invited Mark Zuckerberg to town.
722,21,4,Sgt Yates,"Uh huh, that's what I thought. You all brought Mark Zuckerberg into your lives and now you want the police to shoot him."
723,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"Please, you don't understand! He-h he's such a penis!"
724,21,4,Thomas Tucker,"Yeah, and I'm pretty sure his voice is dubbed and he does all his own sound effects."
725,21,4,Sgt Yates,"Well that doesn't mean he's done anything illegal. Now, the police will help deal with Mark Zuckerberg, but we aren't going to shoot him."
726,21,4,The crowd,Awwwwww!
727,21,4,Sgt Yates,"I'm sorry, that's just the way it is. You all should've thought harder about this before letting him into your lives."
728,21,4,Cartman,"When we all became superheroes, we took an oath. that no matter what it took, we would all make shitloads of money. But thanks to Mark Zuckerberg, right now, we are a superhero group that can't even get a show on Netflix."
729,21,4,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,Zuckerberg is the key. He's the only person who can shut down Facebook.
730,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,How are we gonna get him to do that?
731,21,4,Cartman,We're gonna beat him at his own game.
732,21,4,Barkley,We got the west entrance to town secure. How are you guys doing out east?
733,21,4,Foley,Here he comes... [looks left and walks towards the roadblock. Zuckerberg walks towards town slowly]
734,21,4,Barkley,"Okay, Mr. Zuckerberg, that's gonna have to be it. Can't let you into town."
735,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"So, you think you can block me."
736,21,4,Barkley,"Look, people don't want you here, okay? This is a quiet little town and-"
737,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,Ha ha ha! You cannot block me!
738,21,4,Barkley,"But there's plenty of other places you could go, sir. Can you please just- [Zuckerberg strikes some poses and makes some odd sounds] Don't, don't do that, please."
739,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"[continues making strange sounds and begins moving through the roadblock] My brain, my brain. [more strange sounds]"
740,21,4,Barkley,He walked though.
741,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"[more strange sounds] Oh my car, my car. [more strange sounds and motions] Oh my God it's Mark Zuckerberg. [more strange sounds and motions] Oh my God how'd he do that? [more strange sounds and motions. Jimmy zooms across the street behind him. He turns around, and Jimmy passes by three more times behind him]"
742,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,What's the matter? Too f-fast for ya?
743,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"Ha ha ha, you saw me walk right through the police barricade and yet you think you can block me, riiight? Go ahead and try. [Jimmy walks up to him and between his legs to the other side. Both of them are making their own sound effects]"
744,21,4,Token Black/Tupperware,"[jumps into view] Now, Zuckerberg! Let me see you block my shtoile!"
745,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,Ha ha ha ha ha! [they both make their own sound effects and move around]
746,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,[appeaers and approaches Zuckerberg] Bwa! Dadadadadadadada bam! [punches him in the groin]
747,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,Oh... [falls over his his hands over his privates. The other Coon Friends rush in and kick him on all sides] Hagh. Ow. I have never witness this shtoile before.
748,21,4,Thomas Tucker,"Hey look! The freaky costume kids are getting Zuckerberg! Get him, kids!"
749,21,4,Randy Marsh,Poop in his mouth!
750,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"[Zuckerberg stands up and throws them all off. He then takes on Jimmy, Kyle, and Token individually and defeats them] Rwaaaar!"
751,21,4,Coon Friends,[hitting the ground] Aaaah!
752,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"Ha ha ha, you tried to match my shtoile and failed!"
753,21,4,Cartman,"[walks into view] Oho, it is over! My friends are all beaten! Why?! They were just children! [walks up to Token] This one, simply protesting for black lives! [walks up to Jimmy] And this child tryin' to speak out for handicapped people!"
754,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,"Wha- Why, Mark Zuckerberg??"
755,21,4,Cartman,"And my friend Kyle, guilty of nothing but standing up for the rights of Jews!"
756,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,What what what what are you talking about?
757,21,4,Cartman,"[whispers triumphantly] Ever heard of Facebook Live? [Mark doesn't follow, but Craig is shown in an alley recording this encounter onto his laptop. He waves at Cartman. Cartman turns toward the camera] We are just kids trying to have our voices heard for black, handicapped, and Jewish rights, cut down in our prime by Mark Zuckerberg."
758,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,"But, but hold on, that, that's not true."
759,21,4,Cartman,[triumphantly turns around] Facebook says it's true.
760,21,4,Mark Zuckerberg,Noooooooo! [quickly checks his phone]
761,21,4,Workers,Huh? Hey. What? Huh?
762,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"What's goin' on? Hey everyone, keep working!"
763,21,4,Worker 1,We can't.
764,21,4,Worker 2,Something's wrong with Facebook.
765,21,4,Adam Borque,"It's gone. Like, somebody shut it down."
766,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,What are you talking about? [a door is heard shut]
767,21,4,Cartman,"It's over, Chaos! [shown with the other Coon Friends] We forced your little toady to shut down his own disorder device!"
768,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Curse you, Coon and Friends! This isn't over!"
769,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,"Oh yes it is. [Behind Coon and Friends, Butters' parents enter the abandoned store]"
770,21,4,Stephen Stotch,Butters! You're the one who started all this?!
771,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,Uh oh.
772,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"You think you're just so smart, don't you?! Make me look like a fool, will you?! We'll just see about this!"
773,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Wah. No sir, I, ah. No sir, I just ah."
774,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"Not so funny now, is it?! Go on! Tell Mr. Putin what you told me!"
775,21,4,Butters Stotch/Professor Chaos,"Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia did. And I really didn't break any rules."
776,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"Didn't break any rules?! Good job teaching our children that's all that matters! Just because there's a way to cause chaos in a town, or disrupt an entire country, doesn't mean you go and do it, does it?! If Mark Zuckerberg points a loaded cannon at someone's face, [points at Putin] are you innocent for just lighting the fuse?! Answer me!"
777,21,4,Putin,"Nyet, ser. [""No, sir.""]"
778,21,4,Stephen Stotch,"No! You don't go around making things up about people either! Unless it's about Mark Zuckerberg, because he deserves it! [walks towards the door] I hope you're both very satisfied with the damage you've caused, because you're both GROUNDED! [leaves and slams the door]"
779,21,4,Cartman,"Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV show. All we have to do now is agree on the final draft of the franchise plan. [shown once again, with some changes] You can see that the Super Craig movie now precedes the Coon vs. Super Craig movie, followed by Mysterion's video game. And then we-"
780,21,4,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,How come I have to have the video game? I want a movie too!
781,21,4,Cartman,"You have a movie, Mysterion. You're in the third Coon and Friends United movie [Coon and Friends United 3], after your video game."
782,21,4,Craig Tucker/Super Craig,"Yeah, but he's saying he doesn't ever get his own movie."
783,21,4,Jimmy Valmer/Fastpass,Do I get my own movie?
784,21,4,Cartman,Not everyone gets their own movie!
785,21,4,Tweek Tweak/Wonder Tweek,This franchise plan sucks!
786,21,4,Clyde Donovan/Mosquito,"Oh Jesus, here we go again."
787,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,"No, Wonder Tweek is right. It was better when we started the movies off with the Tupperware prequel."
788,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,Dude you can't do a prequel first.
789,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,Why not?
790,21,4,Kyle Broflovski/Human Kite,"'Cause then it's not a prequel, it's just... first. And besides, Tupperware isn't our strongest character."
791,21,4,Token Black/Tupperware,"Fuck you, it's better than the Human Kite!"
792,21,4,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,He just likes this plan because he gets two movies in Phase 1.
793,21,4,Cartman,Guys! We have to just go with this plan! We don't even have one movie yet!
794,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,You go with the plan! Maybe we'll just... go and do our own franchise!
795,21,4,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,Yeah!
796,21,4,Tweek Tweak/Wonder Tweek,Yeah!
797,21,4,Cartman,Oh! You want civil war! Is that what you want?!
798,21,4,Stan Marsh/Toolshed,"Yeah dude, civil war. Fuck you! [leaves the table and the basement]"
799,21,4,Cartman,Oh fu- oh fuck you! Get out of my house!
800,21,4,Kenny McCormick/Mysterion,"We'll make WAY more money on OUR franchise! [Token and Tweek leave, then Kenny leaves]"
801,21,4,Cartman,"Go ahead! I bet you don't even get halfway through Phase 1 on your franchise, DC Comics! [after Kenny leaves, the door closes. A few seconds of silence follows]"
802,21,4,Craig Tucker/Super Craig,I thought Civil War wasn't supposed to happen until Phase 3.
803,21,5,Marcus Dad,"Okay, okay, can everyone hear me? [taps on the mic to make sure it works] Hello? [the kids quiet down a bit] Thanks, everyone, for helping us celebrate Marcus' birthday. [the kids clap for him] As a special birthday surprise for you, Marcus, we got you your favorite entertainer. Everyone, please welcome Chuck E. Cheese. [A Chuck E. Cheese mascot stumbles onto the stage]"
804,21,5,Chuck E Cheese,Hey. [hits his snout on the mic] Check.
805,21,5,Marcus Preston,[laughs as the other kids cheer] Yes. Yehehehehes.
806,21,5,Chuck E Cheese,"[hits his snout on the mic again, pics up a guitar, and begins to play it as he sings] I ah thanks... for'm celeb... Marcus's birthday."
807,21,5,Marcus Mom,What's wrong with him?
808,21,5,Marcus Dad,Can't you tell? He's high on painkillers!
809,21,5,Chuck E. Cheese,"[stumbles some more and mumbles] Hold on. [strums] Shit. Okay, let's.... do this... [Strums] Never meant to cause you any so- [barfs on stage, falls forward onto the ground in front of the stage and dies. Marcus screams]"
810,21,5,Marcus Dad,"All right, kids, uh, why don't we head back to the party and cut the cake?"
811,21,5,Marcus Preston,I don't want cake! Who's gonna eat cake at a time like this?! [wails. A paramedic closes the back doors of the ambulance as a police officer stands watch]
812,21,5,Officer Stevens,Another drug overdose?
813,21,5,Johnson,"[the paramedic, hands the officer two medications] Most likely. Percolate and Oxycontin found wrapped in his cheesecloth."
814,21,5,Officer Stevens,"Prescription drugs, but with no prescription."
815,21,5,Johnson,You guys know where all these illegal meds are coming from?
816,21,5,Officer Stevens,Most likely from the prisons. Whenever there's a drug epidemic you can usually trace it back to people who've been... thrown away by society and forgotten about.
817,21,5,Vicky,[receptionist] Can I help you?
818,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I'm here to visit my grandpa?"
819,21,5,Vicky,"[puts her hand over her heart] Oh, how nice of you. All right, arms in the air. [two burly men approach Stan. One, Tony, takes the present and hands it to Vicky, the other, Toby, wands Stan. Vicky opens the package] What's the present?"
820,21,5,Stan Marsh,It's just some Hummels.
821,21,5,Vicky,"More Hummels? Why are senior citizens so infatuated with these little German statues? All right, go on, you got ten minutes. [Tony hands the present back to Stan, who goes on in]"
822,21,5,Stan Marsh,Grandpa?
823,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[looking out the window, turns to see him] Billy! [turns around and wheels towards him] Finally you're here to visit. Did you bring Grandpa a present?"
824,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[gives Marvin the present] Yeah, I got what you wanted. [Marvin wheels away to his desk, where he opens the present.]"
825,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Awww, Merry Wanderer [The Hummel with yellow umbrella and bowler hat] and Happy Traveler? [The Hummel with bindle and feather in its cap] These Hummels suck!"
826,21,5,Stan Marsh,That's what the guy gave me.
827,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"It's okay, Billy. I'm just gonna need you to deliver another one of Ms. McGullicutty's crochet pillows."
828,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw, come on, Grandpa. Isn't it enough I come to visit?"
829,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"You don't understand how it works in here. Ms. McGullicutty is top bitch. You do what she says, or you pay the price."
830,21,5,Elderly Man 1,"Oh, please, uh I don't want no trouble. [the three women enter his room] I'm sorry. I'll get better Hummels."
831,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, Stan. Come on, dude, we're gonna go set off fireworks at Kenny's house."
832,21,5,Stan Marsh,I will. I just gotta do this for my grandpa first.
833,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Again? Dude, how many crappy crochet pillows do you have to give out for him?"
834,21,5,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. It's what he wants. I feel bad for him, all right? I think he's miserable."
835,21,5,Eric Cartman,He's old. He's supposed to be miserable.
836,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Look, I just gotta make this exchange for him and then we can go. Oh, oh, I think this is her now. [a red fox with blue gloves and mask prances over]"
837,21,5,Swiper the Fox,"Are you Stan Marsh? It's me, Swiper."
838,21,5,Stan Marsh,Cool. Do you have the Hummel?
839,21,5,Swiper the Fox,"[looks around, then reaches into her tote bag and pulls one out] This is it. Ride Into Christmas, Limited Edition. Now give me the pillow. I have to get to a birthday party."
840,21,5,Stan Marsh,"'Kay, fine. [makes the exchange, and Swiper shakes the pillow until she's satisfied]"
841,21,5,Swiper the Fox,"All right, peace. [prances away]"
842,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's really weird."
843,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Old people love Hummels, dude."
844,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Students, faculty, and staff, today we are facing an epidemic of catastrophic proportions. I know I am not alone in mourning the loss of one of our greatest entertainers, [click. A picture comes up on the projector screen] Chuck E. Cheese. Had we known the personal hell he was going through, perhaps we could've helped. But toooo many were more than eager to supply Chuck E. with the opioids that caused his untimely death. Chuck E. was not the first entertainer to die from this epidemic. Let us not forget Dinkie Dook the Clown [shown with an accordion], dead of a Roxanol overdose at Tommy Schneider's bar mitzvah last March. Shimmer and Shine [two genies], who both collapsed from massive amounts of oxycodone at Nelly Anderson's birthday party. Spider-man, cut down in prime by Demerol, and just recently, Swiper the Fox. dead of multiple opioids found in his crochet pillow. How many more entertainers must we lose before we take action?! It is time to declare war on opioids in our society! [the kids cheer and clap as Stan Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny are shocked at what they just heard]"
845,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck, Stan?!"
846,21,5,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, all right?!"
847,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,You didn't know you were slinging drugs for your grandpa?
848,21,5,Stan Marsh,It didn't occur to me as a possibility.
849,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, did you hear everyone in school?! They're coming after you! You killed Swiper the Fox, and we were standing there with you! You gotta tell people we had no idea what was going on!"
850,21,5,Stan Marsh,I had no idea what was going on!
851,21,5,Butters Stotch,"[walks in and goes to the urinal] Hey fellas! [smiles and looks at them, then turns around and drops his pants and briefs, then lifts up his shirt and pees in the urinal] Boy, that Marcus kid is on the warpath, huh? Well, he's really motivated. I mean, screw that kid, but I guess it's good somebody's finally doing something about these goddamn drug dealers. [Butters finishes, flushes the urinal, zips up, and turns towards the other boys and looks at them again, smiling] Well, see ya, fellas. [turns left and walks out. The other boys haven't moved an inch the whole time he was there]"
852,21,5,Eric Cartman,Our only way out is to go to the police right now and turn Stan's grandpa in!
853,21,5,Stan Marsh,"No, we don't have to do that! Let me talk to him. I can put a stop to this."
854,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[whispering] Grandpa, what the hell have you gotten me into?!"
855,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[whispering] Shhh, quiet. They'll hear you!"
856,21,5,Stan Marsh,"There were drugs in the crochet pillow, weren't there?! Do you know people are dying?!"
857,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"What do you want me to do, Billy? You see Ms. McGullicutty over there? [she's shown tripping a man as he walks to a table with his lunch and chuckling to herself] Whoever has the best Hummel collection is top bitch in this place, and she's got the best. She's ruthless, and she has those old lady farts. You know old lady farts, right? Where they're so loose they don't even acknowledge they happened?"
858,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,"Oh, hello Mr. Marsh. [pfffft]"
859,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, Ms. McGullicutty. How are you feeling today?"
860,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,I'm doing very well. [turns her back to him and farts again] Have they given you Percocet for that knee of yours? [pfffft]
861,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, yeah, here, I I just got it, huh. Here you go. [hands her the Percocet]"
862,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,"Oh, you'd almost think you were trying to keep them from me. [pfffft]"
863,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, uh, ma'am? My grandpa actually really needs those drugs. He's in a lot of pain."
864,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,"Ohhh, and who's this little rascal? [walks around to Stan's chair and looks over his shoulder]"
865,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"That's my grandson, uh he he's worthless."
866,21,5,Ms McGullicutty,"How sweet. [pfffft] Hmmm, coming to visit your old poppa in the joint, huh? You love your poppa, don't you? [pfffft. Stan winces] You'd hate to see him suffer even more he already is. [slow, soft pfffft. Stan avoids looking at her and winces again. Now she addresses Marvin] You watch your ass, Marsh, or I'll have you sent to the quiet room. [pfffft. She turns right and walks away, hitting a man with her can on the way out]"
867,21,5,Stan Marsh,"What, what is she talking about? What's the quiet room?"
868,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"I told you, she has all the pull in here. You go against what she says, you end up in solitaire."
869,21,5,Mr Standish,"No! No, please, uh I didn't do anything!"
870,21,5,Tony,"It's all right, Mr. Standish, you just need a little quiet time."
871,21,5,Mr Standish,"Uh, I don't even know how to play solitaire. Please! [they lock him up and leave]"
872,21,5,Marcus Preston,I understand that today they are performing Chuck E. Cheese's autopsy?
873,21,5,Receptionist,"Oh, the kids' party performer. Yeah."
874,21,5,Marcus Preston,"As a concerned member of the public, I wish to be present."
875,21,5,Receptionist,"Uh, sorry, children aren't really allowed in autopsies."
876,21,5,Marcus Preston,Then I shall wait here to learn the coroner's findings.
877,21,5,Coroner,"Toxicology reports show subject had massive amounts of opioids in system at time of death. Now proceeding. [he and his assistant pull the sheet off and the coroner begins to saw the performer's mask off. The officer begins to feel sick. The mask is finally removed, and the officer vomits]"
878,21,5,Coroner,Have these put in the garbage.
879,21,5,Marcus Preston,"What did you find, coroner?"
880,21,5,Coroner,Who is this?
881,21,5,Marcus Preston,"There is an epidemic in our community, sir. Some of us actually care to confront the problem! Now, dammit, what did you find?"
882,21,5,Coroner,Nothing out of the ordinary. The subject died of a simple overdose. We found nothing else except for two Hummmels in the subject's rectal cavity.
883,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Hummels? In his rectal cavity, you say? And you do not find this out of the ordinary?"
884,21,5,Coroner,Not at all. We found Hummels in nearly all the birthday entertainers' anal cavities. It's very common in our overdose victims.
885,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Mmmm, a bit too common, don't you think?"
886,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Guys, why does Grandpa have to be in a nursing home? Can't he live with us again?"
887,21,5,Randy Marsh,"Stan, Grandpas has a lot of needs that we can't provide him here. He needs professional supervision."
888,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Is that really it? Because I, I just feel like we kind of threw Grandpa away and forgot about him."
889,21,5,Randy Marsh,Oh really? Do you have any idea how much money we pay to have Grandpa in that place? Your grandpa is stylin'! Can you imagine being able to just sit around all day and not have to do anything but eat and watch TV?
890,21,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I'd probably go crazy and wanna kill myself.
891,21,5,Randy Marsh,"Jesus, Stan! It's not like he's in jail!"
892,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's kind of like jail. You should go visit him."
893,21,5,Randy Marsh,"I can't! I'm too busy busting my ass to pay the bills for that place, and to pay for your guitar lessons!"
894,21,5,Stan Marsh,I don't have guitar lessons.
895,21,5,Randy Marsh,I don't want to go there. It's depressing. Aw you tricked me.
896,21,5,Stan Marsh,[his phone rings and he answers] Hello?
897,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,[at the downtown corner with Butters] Dude! Did you give Butters a crochet pillow to drop off?!
898,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[quickly leaves the table] Dude, I don't have a choice. I have to get the Hummels for my grandpa."
899,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, you need to get Hummels without making Butters a drug dealer!"
900,21,5,Butters Stotch,Drug dealer??
901,21,5,Stan Marsh,"All right, all right! I think I know another way."
902,21,5,Delivery Man,"Hey, we have this week's delivery of medications."
903,21,5,Vicky,"Bring them in. [the delivery man goes outside and motions for a truck driver to back up and dump the medications. The truck backs up and dumps the meds onto the asphalt at the community's entrance, then rolls away. Stan has walked up to the community entrance and watches the truck leave]"
904,21,5,Stan Marsh,Ah!
905,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Hello, Mr. Marsh."
906,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Uh hey, hey Marcus."
907,21,5,Marcus Preston,I understand you've become quite the Hummel collector lately. What's the... fascination with Hummels?
908,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Nothing. I-look, I, I just really like Hummels, okay? I'm just, I'm really into Hummels."
909,21,5,Marcus Preston,Ah! I see. So then you should be able to tell me what this Hummel is called!
910,21,5,Stan Marsh,"That, that's uh..."
911,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Come on! If you're a Hummel expert, then you should know its name!"
912,21,5,Stan Marsh,"That, it's, it's ""Whistling In The Rain."""
913,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Wrong! It's called ""Stormy Weather!"" Do you know where it was found?"
914,21,5,Stan Marsh,No.
915,21,5,Marcus Preston,"It was found deep in the anus of one Chuck E. Cheese, the renowned entertainer beloved by millions! If you know something about the epidemic that is killing artists, you'd better cough it up!"
916,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Marcus, trust me. You don't wanna get involved."
917,21,5,Marcus Preston,"I became involved when Chuck E. Cheese collapsed like a rag doll before my very eyes! If you had any involvement, I will bring you down!"
918,21,5,Randy Marsh,"Well, it's really great seeing you, Dad. Guess we oughtta hit the road soon."
919,21,5,Marvin Marsh,You finally come to visit and leave after 10 minutes?
920,21,5,Randy Marsh,"Aw Jesus, now we know where Stan gets his guilt trips from!"
921,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"[appears at Marvin's door] Mmmm [Marvin looks over his shoulder], it seems somebody's been a little naughty lately. [pfffft]"
922,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[turns a bit to see her] Oh, Ms. McGullicutty, heh heh. How are you?"
923,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"[walks over to Marvin's meager Hummel collection] Hrrmm. My, what a lovely Hummel collection you're starting to amass. [sniffs] Almost smells [pfffft]... brand new, doesn't it? [pfft. She turns to face Marvin] Like it was purchased right from the factory. [pfffft] Ooooo! And who are these lovely people? [walks up to Randy and Sharon] Family that came to visit, no doubt? [pfft]"
924,21,5,Randy Marsh,"[holding his breath] Yes. Yeah, we love coming here."
925,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"Ah, family. I remember when I was a little girl. [pfffft] My brother used to play such tricks on me. [pfft-pfft] Tried to fool me. Tried to get out from his responsibilities. [pfffft]"
926,21,5,Marvin Marsh,I'm giving you Hummels. What's it matter where they came from? [Mrs. McGullicutty farts again]
927,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"[chuckles] Nooo, [Randy covers his nose] it doesn't matter to me. But it matters to them. [pfffft] The big guys. You see, what they want is more people who are addicted to crochet pillows. [pfffft] Got it? [pfffft. She makes her way towards the door] Nice to meet you fine folks. [pfffft]"
928,21,5,Randy Marsh,Wugh. [whispers to Sharon] We're never visiting here again.
929,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Ohooo, you're dead Butters."
930,21,5,Butters Stotch,Haw Jeez.
931,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[runs in] Guys! Guys, I need your help."
932,21,5,Eric Cartman,"If it has to do with your heroin operation, count us out."
933,21,5,Stan Marsh,I just talked to my grandpa. There's more at work here than just old people pushing pills.
934,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, we told you we don't wanna be involved."
935,21,5,Stan Marsh,[stands in front of the TV] The head bitch of the nursing home is gonna take my grandpa down. Maybe my whole family.
936,21,5,Butters Stotch,"[trying to see the game] Get out of the way, dude!"
937,21,5,Stan Marsh,But I know what to do! Whoever has the best Hummels controls the nursing home. We've gotta steal this lady's Hummel collection and give it to my grandpa!
938,21,5,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Stan] Dude, Stan, even if we wanted to help you, which we don't, there's no way we can sneak into an old folks home, distract all the old people, and take an old lady's Hummels! [turns to the left with a thought and walks off] Oh wait, there totally is a way we could do that."
939,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[catches up] Yeah? What ih, what is it, Cartman."
940,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're not getting involved!"
941,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, if you have an idea, please tell me. I need you."
942,21,5,Eric Cartman,I know how to distract old people.
943,21,5,Kyle Broflovski,Haww shit!
944,21,5,Marcus Preston,Yes?
945,21,5,Annie,We're at Mimi Thompson's party. Peppa Pig just collapsed on stage. [it's Mimi's 10th birthday]
946,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Oh my God! Don't let anyone near Peppa Pig until I arrive! [leaves the house. Soon he's at the party] Move aside! Let me through! [reaches the stage and kneels next to Peppa] Aw Peppa. Peppa, can you hear me? [Peppa moans] My name is Marcus Preston. Can you understand me? Where did you get the drugs, Peppa? Was it from Stan Marsh?"
947,21,5,Peppa Pig,"[a black man in costume] Yo man, whatchoo talkin' about? Get me a fuckin' ambulance!"
948,21,5,Marcus Preston,"[tearing up] Shh, Peppa. Focus. Soon you'll be in heaven jumping in all the puddles you can imagine. But first, you must tell me, where do the Hummels go, Peppa?"
949,21,5,Ambulance lady,"All right, let us through. Get away, kids."
950,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Peppa, now! Why Hummels?! You've got to squeal!"
951,21,5,Peppa Pig,Old people. Old people... love... Hummels. [groans a couple more times and dies]
952,21,5,Marcus Preston,"It's okay, she's with Chuck E. Cheese now."
953,21,5,Vicky,Can I help you?
954,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Oh yes, hello. We are adorable children here to entertain old people."
955,21,5,Vicky,Didn't think we had anyone scheduled tonight. Are you with the Protestant youth group?
956,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Yes that's right, we are young prostitutes here to volunteer however we can."
957,21,5,Vicky,"Fine. Round them up, we got another kids choir!"
958,21,5,Toby,"Come on, let's go. Children's choir in the commons."
959,21,5,Residents,[amid groans] Aw dammit. Shit.
960,21,5,Toby,Darlin' children are gonna sing for you! Move your asses!
961,21,5,Elderly Man 2,"Aw, not again."
962,21,5,Eric Cartman,"All right, seniors. How are we feeling tonight? Our youth group has come to lift your spirits with some songs to take you down memory lane. We hope you can enjoy some nice old-people music. [blows into a pitch pipe to determine a scale to sing in]"
963,21,5,Eric Cartman,I'm... insane in the membrane.
964,21,5,The Boys,Insane in the membrane.
965,21,5,Butters Stotch,Insane in the brain
966,21,5,The Boys,"Crazy insane, got no brain."
967,21,5,Eric Cartman,In the membrane.
968,21,5,Eric Cartman,Myyyy milkshake brings all the boys
969,21,5,The Boys,"to the yard, and they're like [Butters sticks his finger into his mouth and pops it out] it's better than yours."
970,21,5,Eric Cartman,Damn right!
971,21,5,The Boys,[Butters sticks his finger into his mouth and pops it out] it's better than yours.
972,21,5,Eric Cartman,"My hot milkshake.

 And now here's our own take on that oldie, but goodie by Nirvana."
973,21,5,The Boys,"In the cool, cool winter."
974,21,5,Eric Cartman,Rape me.
975,21,5,The Boys,"In the hot hot summertime.
Rape me, my friend."
976,21,5,Elderly Man 3,You suck!
977,21,5,Eric Cartman,Hey hey! We are adorable children trying to bring sunshine into your lives!
978,21,5,Elderly Man 3,[gives Cartman the bird] Fuck you!
979,21,5,Eric Cartman,"Fuck you! [picks a different note] 
If you"
980,21,5,The Boys,Want to call me baby
981,21,5,Eric Cartman,Just go ahead now-
982,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Hello, Mr. Marsh!"
983,21,5,Stan Marsh,Marcus.
984,21,5,Marcus Preston,[turns on the light] I told you I'd bring you down. [quickly takes out his phone and takes a picture]
985,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Marcus, it's not what you think. I'm trying to make things better here. [he and Marcus begin to walk around each other slowly]"
986,21,5,Marcus Preston,"Oh, I bet you are! You, your grandpa, ALL the people here, are going to jail! I'm calling the police!"
987,21,5,Stan Marsh,"You can put an end to this place, but you won't be stopping the problem. These people are victims too, Marcus. Victims of a way bigger game being played by way bigger people!"
988,21,5,Marcus Preston,"[turns his back to Stan] Oh, you're a fine one for speeches! When it comes to saving your own ass!"
989,21,5,Stan Marsh,"It's not for me, Marcus. Look, I know you loved Chuck E. Cheese. [Marcus stops dialing] I know you'd do anything to bring down the people who took him from you. [Marcus begins to soften and soon gets emotional] That's why you have to go further, Marcus. Take it to the people who profited from Chuck E.'s addiction."
990,21,5,Marcus Preston,"[turns around, sobbing] He was just a mouse... who wanted to make people happy. [walks up to Stan, and they hug each other]"
991,21,5,Stan Marsh,I know. I know.
992,21,5,The Boys,"No time to search the world around
When I come around. When I come around."
993,21,5,Eric Cartman,"I come around.

 [the residents begin to leave one by one]"
994,21,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey, where are ya'll goin'?"
995,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,Back to our rooms. You kids are absolutely awful. [pfffft]
996,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,[notices her door already open] What the? [pfft] Someone is in my room! [pfffft. She goes in with her two friends]
997,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,Whaaaat?! [pfffft]
998,21,5,Marvin Marsh,Billy. What are you doin' here?
999,21,5,Stan Marsh,"[moves to his right] Surprise, Grandpa. [a bag appears where Stan stood just moments ago] I got what you needed."
1000,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Heh. [rolls forward] Billy, Mrs. McGullicutty's Hummel collection. You got it for me."
1001,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Grandpa. Now you can put a stop to all this, right?"
1002,21,5,Marvin Marsh,Yeah. I just might be able to.
1003,21,5,Stan Marsh,"What are you doing, Grandpa?"
1004,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"I told you, Billy. These Hummels hold a special power with old people."
1005,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,[enters with her friends] You! [pfffft]
1006,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[to Stan] Go on, get out of here."
1007,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,You really thought stealing my Hummels would make you the head bitch in this place?! [pfffft]
1008,21,5,Marvin Marsh,Yeah. I think it will. [swings the bag around and gives her a bloody nose]
1009,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"Aaah! [Marvin swings the bag around and takes out Mrs. McGullicutty's friends, he keeps swinging at them as they escape his room. The other residents look out of their rooms and cheer him on. He swings at Mrs. McGullicutty all the way down the hallway until she stops moving. The boys arrive]"
1010,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"[turns and looks at the boys, and smiles] Now you know how we do shit in the nursing home."
1011,21,5,Eric Cartman,...That's pretty sweet.
1012,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,"You get your paws off of me, young man! [pfffft]"
1013,21,5,Tony,"There there, Ms. McGullicutty. Everything's gonna be all right. [they take her to solitaire]"
1014,21,5,Mrs McGullicutty,No! [pfffft] Not solitaire! [pfffft] I won't play it! You can't make me! [pffpffft. Tony and Toby put her inside and lock the door. Stan and Marvin watch from the Senior Cafe]
1015,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Congratulations on becoming head bitch, Grandpa."
1016,21,5,Marvin Marsh,"Thank you, Billy. Now if we could only take down the real douchebags who profit from all this."
1017,21,5,Stan Marsh,"Ahhh, don't worry. I have a feeling that's about to happen."
1018,21,6,Stuart McCormick,What time are the other guys gettin' there?
1019,21,6,Roger Donovan,"Everyone just said sundown, which should be soon."
1020,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,I want candy.
1021,21,6,The Three Men,I want candy.
1022,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Lookin' good, Ryan."
1023,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"Yeah, I got a real cape this year. Check it out. [holds it up for the others to check out, and Gerald pulls away]"
1024,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Hey Sharon, did you see the box of Jack Daniels?"
1025,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh no, you're not doing this again."
1026,21,6,Randy Marsh,What do you mean? Of course I am.
1027,21,6,Sharon Marsh,Stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch.
1028,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, you know the week leading up to Halloween is always my Witch Party Week with the guys."
1029,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, and you guys get wasted."
1030,21,6,Randy Marsh,"We have some drinks. Come on, all the other guys' wives aren't being bitchy about it."
1031,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Sup, witches! [gets into the car]"
1032,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Alright, Randy's got the JD!"
1033,21,6,Randy Marsh,Yep. Who's got the other stuff.
1034,21,6,Stuart McCormick,"Kevin said he's bringing it. [Randy chuckles, then the other men join in]"
1035,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[Impatient, yet quiet] Come on, come on... [normal voice] Sweetheart, can we get going, please?"
1036,21,6,Heidi Turner,"[from her closet] Hang on, babe. Just a couple more things. [tosses out random pieces of clothing]"
1037,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Honey, the pumpkin patch opened like an hour ago and 'member how I was saying I want to get there early?"
1038,21,6,Heidi Turner,[dressed in a black spider suit and orange skirt with bats on it] What do you think?
1039,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[urgently] Great, perfect. Let's go to the pumpkin patch."
1040,21,6,Heidi Turner,Yup! Almost ready. [gets up on her chair and pulls out two items from her dresser]
1041,21,6,Eric Cartman,Wha-what?
1042,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Okay, spider or the bat?"
1043,21,6,Eric Cartman,[getting exasperated] The spider's great.
1044,21,6,Heidi Turner,Really? 'Cause I think I like the bat.
1045,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[quietly, from the other side of her bed] Why does she do this every time?"
1046,21,6,Heidi Turner,"What, babe?"
1047,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[urgently] I said it's time. Boy, look at the time."
1048,21,6,Heidi Turner,"'Kay, all set."
1049,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[leaves the bedroom] 'Kay, here we go, going to the pumpkin patch."
1050,21,6,Heidi Turner,[leaves the bedroom] Okay! Oh! I forgot my glitter lip gloss! [heads for the bathroom]
1051,21,6,Eric Cartman,You don't need glitter lip gloss!
1052,21,6,Heidi Turner,"[stops short of the bathroom, turns around and walks back] Eric, are you upset? Do you need to talk about something?"
1053,21,6,Eric Cartman,"No! No, we don't need to talk! Ah, I'm super happy!"
1054,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Oh, okay. [heads back to the bathroom, and Cartman is dejected. Heidi looks back for a second] Hang on, I gotta pee. [closes the bathroom door]"
1055,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Cool, you got to pee again. Awesome."
1056,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Almost thought you guys were gonna bail on us.
1057,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[chuckling] Yeah, right. We're gonna miss the first night of the party."
1058,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Sup, Stephen, Chip."
1059,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Just ready to party farty, witches. [holds up two six-packs of Samuel Adams beer]"
1060,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Well, I got the Jack."
1061,21,6,Thomas Tucker,[steps out of his truck with Steve] And I got the crack.
1062,21,6,Randy Marsh,Oh yeah! Jack and Crack Witch Week! Let's do this!
1063,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Everybody up the hill! [the men proceed up the hill, singing Wang Chung's ""Everybody Have Fun Tonight""]"
1064,21,6,The Men,"Everybody have fun tonight
Jack and Crack Witch Week tonight
Everybod-"
1065,21,6,Mr Turner,"Thanks for taking the kids out tonight, Ms. Cartman. Heidi's been looking forward to it."
1066,21,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh yes, my little Eric just loves the pumpkin patch. It's one of his favorite events of the year."
1067,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, come on, let's go."
1068,21,6,Liane Cartman,"All right, you kids all ready?"
1069,21,6,Eric Cartman,[directing his comments at Heidi upstairs] Yup. All set to go to the pumpkin patch! It's been open for over an hour now! [Heidi finally comes down the stairs]
1070,21,6,Nancy Turner,"Ohoh, don't you look cute, Heidi."
1071,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[goes to the front door and opens it] Awesome. Here we go, heading out now!"
1072,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Hold on, Eric. I want a picture."
1073,21,6,Eric Cartman,"No! Pumpkin patch is gonna, eh-"
1074,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Will you take a picture, dad?"
1075,21,6,Eric Cartman,"See, all the best pumpkins get taken and then eh-"
1076,21,6,Mr Turner,Cheese.
1077,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, come on! Here we go, going out the door! Go, Mom!"
1078,21,6,Heidi Turner,Bye Daddy! Love you!
1079,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[at the car door] 'Kay, here we go to the pumpkin patch!"
1080,21,6,Heidi Turner,Oh crap. Hang on! I forgot my bracelet!
1081,21,6,Eric Cartman,[in the car] Oh my fucking God!
1082,21,6,Liane Cartman,"Eric, potty mouth."
1083,21,6,Eric Cartman,Arrrrrrrrgh!
1084,21,6,The Men,Put a spell on our bosses. Put a spell on our wives. A hex on the Patriots. Let's fuck up their lives!
1085,21,6,Randy Marsh,And screw the Raiders too!
1086,21,6,The Men,Yeah! [some time passes and they're getting wasted]
1087,21,6,Randy Marsh,"No way. Check out Stephen, you guys."
1088,21,6,Stephen Stotch,[walks around as if riding a broom] Heeheeheehee. Happy Witch Week! [falls to the ground face first] Ow. [the other men laugh at him.]
1089,21,6,Chip Duncan,"[walks in with a book] Hey, HEY! [the partying stops] You guys wanna see some real witchcraft? [no one replies for a few seconds]"
1090,21,6,Randy Marsh,Oooooooooooooo. [the men laugh]
1091,21,6,Chip Duncan,"I mean it! I got this spell book last month. Got it in Salem, Massachusetts. They say it's real."
1092,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Like real, how?"
1093,21,6,Chip Duncan,Like from the Devil himself. You guys wanna try it?
1094,21,6,The Men,Yeah.
1095,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Hey, wait up, babe! [Cartman stops, closes his eyes, and stretches out his hand for Heidi to take when she catches up to him]"
1096,21,6,Butters Stotch,"[walks by with his pumpkin and his mom] Hey, where you been, Eric?"
1097,21,6,Scott Malkinson,Oh boy! What a great time that was.
1098,21,6,Ticket taker,"Thanks for coming, kids. [sees Cartman and Heidi approaching] Oh, you just getting here?"
1099,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we are just getting here."
1100,21,6,Ticket taker,"Okay uh, go on in, I suppose. Petting zoo's closed, and I think they stopped the churro machine."
1101,21,6,Eric Cartman,The petting zoo's cl- The petting zoo's closed?
1102,21,6,Ticket taker,Yeah. You can still maybe do the bouncy house.
1103,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Come on, babe!"
1104,21,6,Chip Duncan,Arkna. Peduum. Uthnod boral.
1105,21,6,Randy Marsh,That's pretty cool. [strikes up a crack pipe]
1106,21,6,Chip Duncan,Uthnod boral! Uthnod alvernderaal! Wickus! [a green glow emanates from the book] Stayfalls-wuh. Uh.
1107,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa."
1108,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Ach. Oh, it burns!"
1109,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Okay, Chip. You might need to ease up on that crack there, buddy. [Chip drops the book and screams, and begins to transform into an actual witch. A broom flies to him and he rides off on it, cackling]"
1110,21,6,Chip Duncan,I'll kill you all! Kill you all!
1111,21,6,Chip Duncan,[cackling] You'll all be dead by Halloween! [cackles some more]
1112,21,6,Ticket taker,Get out! Everyone out!
1113,21,6,Eric Cartman,What do you mean?! I just got here!
1114,21,6,Ticket taker,There's a witch! [Chip flies in and starts bombing the patch]
1115,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Come on, Eric!"
1116,21,6,Eric Cartman,"No! I missed it! I missed it all! [Heidi pulls him away. Chip sees a boy, plucks him off the ground and carries him away]"
1117,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh. Hey, didn't see you there."
1118,21,6,Sharon Marsh,Did you hear anything about what happened last night?
1119,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened?"
1120,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Your buddy, Chip Duncan? [holds up her phone, on which there's a news report about it] Apparently, he flew around on a broom, blew things up, and kidnapped some children?"
1121,21,6,Randy Marsh,Are you serious?!
1122,21,6,Sharon Marsh,You heard nothing about this?! He flew away vowing we'd all be dead by Halloween!
1123,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[hands her back the phone and walks off] God, I knew that guy was a fuckin' chode!"
1124,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, what did you guys do at that party?"
1125,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[turns around] Nothin'. We were just hangin' out and talkin' and stuff, and then Chip got all weird."
1126,21,6,Sharon Marsh,People were hurt!
1127,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I agree! It's awful! We're not like Chip, okay?! He's a bad witch!"
1128,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Did any of you guys actually see the witch?
1129,21,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, it was terrifying. She had a broom and a cackle and everything."
1130,21,6,Token Black,"What are we gonna do, guys?"
1131,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around! [next to him, Cartman has an angry glare on his face]"
1132,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that?
1133,21,6,Stan Marsh,"No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early."
1134,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. [the camera begins to focus on Cartman's glare]"
1135,21,6,Stan Marsh,We've got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe.
1136,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, but what are we gonna do?"
1137,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No, we've got to just hope the police will handle it."
1138,21,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, right. Like they'll handle anything. [from a nearby table, Heidi peeks past Bebe and smiles at Cartman, waving at him]"
1139,21,6,Token Black,"Stan's right. This might fall on us. [Cartman waves back, his glare fixed on her]"
1140,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, we've got to save Halloween. Don't you think so, Eric?"
1141,21,6,Eric Cartman,[his concentration is broken] What?
1142,21,6,Butters Stotch,We've got to do something to get rid of her!
1143,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes. You're right, guys. It's my only way out."
1144,21,6,Randy Marsh,"All right, see you, Sharon. Have a good night."
1145,21,6,Sharon Marsh,[displeased] Where do you think you're going?
1146,21,6,Randy Marsh,What do you mean? It's Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys.
1147,21,6,Sharon Marsh,[stands up] You can't possibly be considering doing this again!
1148,21,6,Randy Marsh,Why not?
1149,21,6,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don't think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!"
1150,21,6,Randy Marsh,Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we're supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus! [turns around and walks out the front door]
1151,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,Hey Randy.
1152,21,6,Randy Marsh,Sup guys?
1153,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches."
1154,21,6,Randy Marsh,"I know, right? It's like, there's one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they're coming after all of us. This is like a witch... thingy."
1155,21,6,Stuart McCormick,It's like a witch pursuit thingy.
1156,21,6,Randy Marsh,A witch uhhh-
1157,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,It's a witch chase and shoot 'em up.
1158,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, that's what it is!"
1159,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"Hey, what the hell is this?"
1160,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[reading the sign] ""Park closed until further notice"". That's bullshit!"
1161,21,6,Stuart McCormick,Oh my God.
1162,21,6,Randy Marsh,They can't do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing!
1163,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape."
1164,21,6,Stan Marsh,What are bent pits? [Cartman walks in with some plans]
1165,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey guys, I think I got it figured out."
1166,21,6,Stan Marsh,You do?
1167,21,6,Butters Stotch,"I knew Eric would come up with a plan! [Cartman puts up a drawing of his plan, which involves the boys luring Heidi to her death, burying the body, and celebrating her death with a pizza. He then brings out his retractable pointer and starts pointing]"
1168,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town? Ross Dress for Less, that's right. Stan and Kyle will wait inside the Ross Dress for Less, and I will bring Heidi there. Once inside, Kenny and Butters will set off a series of explosions that will-"
1169,21,6,Stan Marsh,Wait wait wait wait. What the fuck are you talking about?
1170,21,6,Eric Cartman,This is how we're going to get rid of Heidi.
1171,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody's talking about getting rid of Heidi!
1172,21,6,Eric Cartman,You guys said you would help me get rid of her!
1173,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,OF THE WITCH!
1174,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Who cares about a witch?! My life is a living hell, you guys!"
1175,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Then break up with her! You clearly can't stand her! LET THE POOR GIRL GO!
1176,21,6,Eric Cartman,I've tried! It's impossible!
1177,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?!
1178,21,6,Eric Cartman,"You don't understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don't know 'cause you've never had a girlfriend, Kyle! [Kyle just stares angrily at him] Fine. Just leave me to suffer. Next time you want me to kill someone for you, just forget about it! [leaves the room]"
1179,21,6,Mayor McDaniels,"Students and parents, I know that you are all concerned about the witch who is preying upon our town, and I wanna speak to you all about how to try and protect yourselves. But first, some gentlemen have asked to speak on what they perceive to be a [does air quotes] ""witch pursuit thing"". [walks off the stage as the gentlemen in costume get on stage and arrange themselves around the mic]"
1180,21,6,Richard Tweak,"Oh wait, I'm supposed to be-"
1181,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, sure, no. [to Stuart] You go over there."
1182,21,6,Stuart McCormick,Right. Right right right. [music starts and they begin singing]
1183,21,6,The Men,"We're all on the same side, you and I.
Let's all stick togetha, let's try.
When things are going bad and there's people you need to confront.
Just be sure it doesn't turn into a witch pursuit thing."
1184,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"[as the other men provide ambient harmony] Hey guys, there's good witches and there's bad witches, and we stand with you in saying this particular witch needs to be brought down. But that doesn't men we should all be closing parks and stopping all witch activity because [catches up with the others on vocals]"
1185,21,6,The Men,Let's not turn this into a witch pursuit thing.
1186,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Gerald] Dad, get out of here! We're trying to deal with an actual witch! Nobody's coming after you!"
1187,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Yes they are, boys! And next they'll be coming after you! 'Cause you're all little sons a witches!"
1188,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"Right. You don't have to worry about us, going around snatching children. Only the other witch does that. [Cartman's face lights up and he looks at Heidi. He gets a mischievous look in his eyes]"
1189,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, babe."
1190,21,6,Heidi Turner,Oh. Hey Eric.
1191,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Listen uh, there's a big fun costume party tonight and I was thinking you and me should go. What do you say?"
1192,21,6,Heidi Turner,A costume party? With everything that's going on?
1193,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I just think, you know, we need to let off some steam and have a little Halloween fun, you know? I already have our costumes picked out."
1194,21,6,Heidi Turner,Well... I guess.
1195,21,6,Eric Cartman,Cool. I'll pick you up at 5.
1196,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Well, maybe make it 4:30 if you're bringing the costumes. [Cartman turns left and walks away] I might need a little extra time getting ready."
1197,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[stops, then mischievously] Ohohoh, I'm counting on it. [walks off]"
1198,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Randy, can I talk to you?"
1199,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Sure, Stephen."
1200,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"I've been doing a lot of thinking, Randy. About the past. About what we've done. I think it's time we come clean and tell everyone about the crack. And the spells against our wives."
1201,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[quickly closes the door and walks up to Stephen] Okay, look. You're freaked out, it's understandable."
1202,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"I have to admit what I've done wrong, Randy! I feel like everything's crashing down and I want Linda to hear it from me first."
1203,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Okay, we smoked a little crack. We put harmless spells on our wives. We were just messing around, it was harmless fun."
1204,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Was it? Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming?
1205,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Stephen, you can't turn on your own kind. That's what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay? They make everyone go crazy."
1206,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"I'm sorry, Randy. I have to clear my conscience."
1207,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[sighs] All right, Stephen. At least give us till tomorrow morning to talk to our wives and prepare them, all right? Can you just give us till morning?"
1208,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Yeah, sure. [walks to the front door] I'm sorry."
1209,21,6,Randy Marsh,"It's okay. It's okay. [Stephen leaves. A few second later, Randy is on the phone calling up someone] Hey, it's Randy. Weve got until tomorrow morning to sacrifice Stephen to the Devil. I'll explain later, just get everyone together. And, maybe bring just a little bit of crack."
1210,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Don't you think we should stay on the main roads, Eric? This seems like a bad place to be right now."
1211,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, Heidi. This is the fastest way to the party. [loudly] I'm sure the witch won't even notice us."
1212,21,6,Heidi Turner,"Eric, come on, this is a bad idea. Let's turn around."
1213,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Well, Heidi, if we'd been on time, we wouldn't need to take a short cut. But I wanted to give you your space to get ready."
1214,21,6,Heidi Turner,"[sensing the sarcasm] Is that what this is about? You're still mad about the pumpkin patch, aren't you?"
1215,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Why would I be mad? You wanted to make sure you looked right, and then you had to eat and use the bathroom 40 times. I can't blame you for missing the pumpkin patch."
1216,21,6,Heidi Turner,"I didn't use the bathroom 40 times! [Chip is heard above them] What was that? [the leaves in the trees rustle and she looks up] Eric! Did you hear that?! [she turns to see him, but he's gone] Eric?! Eric! Oh my God! Eric, are you okay?!"
1217,21,6,Chip Duncan,"[finally appears] Well, well. What have we here?"
1218,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[barely above a whisper, hiding behind a fallen tree trunk] Sweet. Come on, come on."
1219,21,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, is your dad home?"
1220,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I, I don't know where he is."
1221,21,6,Stan Marsh,We can't find our dads either.
1222,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, and it turns out our dads and the bad witch were all part of the same witch group."
1223,21,6,Stan Marsh,"We asked our moms, and they said this has been going on for years. We've got to find them before something stupider happens."
1224,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,How are we gonna do that?
1225,21,6,Stan Marsh,There's another guy. Someone else who was in the witches' club that hasn't been around for a while.
1226,21,6,Kyle Broflovski,Who?
1227,21,6,President s Aide,"[opens the door and looks in] Mr. President, you have an urgent call from a Butters Stotch?"
1228,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"[lost in thought, he perks up] Butters? What's he want? [picks up the phone at his desk] This is the President."
1229,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Oh, uh, eh hello Mr. President. How are you?"
1230,21,6,Stan Marsh,"[in Butters' room with Kyle and Kenny] Butter him up, Butters."
1231,21,6,Butters Stotch,"How uh, how is runnin' the country going?"
1232,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, it's fine. You know, just makin' the country great again."
1233,21,6,Butters Stotch,Did you get rid of all the immigrants like you said?
1234,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"I got rid of like, six of 'em so far. You know, it's a little harder than I thought."
1235,21,6,Butters Stotch,Cool. Ah-and did you build that big wall you were gonna build?
1236,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Don't be a dick, Butters. Are you just callin' to shit on my Halloween?"
1237,21,6,Butters Stotch,"N-no, sir! I uh, well, the thing is, uh, didn't you used to do J and C Witch Week with our dads?"
1238,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Yeah, it was my favorite time of year. Now I just have to celebrate it alone."
1239,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Well, the thing is, Mr. President, one of the guys did a spell and took a bunch of children, and he's gonna eat 'em all."
1240,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Lemme guess: Chip Duncan. Oh, that guy was always such a douche."
1241,21,6,Butters Stotch,"Mr. President, please, you've gotta help. Our dads can't do anything 'cause they're scared people are comin' after all wtiches."
1242,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Comin' after all witches? Oh, Jeez..."
1243,21,6,Sgt Yates,So you were there when the witch showed up and took your girlfriend.
1244,21,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, it just came out of nowhere. I tried to save Heidi, but it was too late."
1245,21,6,Sgt Yates,What was your girlfriend wearing?
1246,21,6,Eric Cartman,"She was dressed kind of like me, but had a simple Munich dirndl from Germany."
1247,21,6,Rick,And you didn't stop at all to think that what you were doing might attract a witch?
1248,21,6,Eric Cartman,Excuse me?! Are you actually trying to blame the victim here?!
1249,21,6,Rick,"No, I'm just saying that if there's a big fat witch around, maybe you shouldn't walk around in the woods dressed as Hansel and Gretel."
1250,21,6,Eric Cartman,Ohhhhh!
1251,21,6,Sgt Yates,"Whoa, whoa, not cool, Rick. Not cool."
1252,21,6,Eric Cartman,"I will have your badge, sir!"
1253,21,6,Sgt Yates,"[looks towards the camera] Sorry folks, sorry."
1254,21,6,Cop 1,Detective! Detective! Call just came in. The witch has been spotted at Ross Dress For Less.
1255,21,6,Sgt Yates,"Everyone to Ross Dress For Less, now!"
1256,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Guys? I'm here. Guys? What's this all about?
1257,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Hello, Stephen."
1258,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, hey. What are we meeting here for?"
1259,21,6,Ryan Valmer,"It's too late, Stephen. We called the police. We know you took those children."
1260,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"What? What uh, What are you doing?"
1261,21,6,Steve Black,"[accompanied by Stuart] Here he is, everybody! Stephen's a bad witch!"
1262,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Nooo! [people begin to gather around the witches]
1263,21,6,Randy Marsh,"We're putting a stop to you, Stephen, because that's what good witches do!"
1264,21,6,Stephen Stotch,Oh my God! I see what this is! This witch pursuit thing has you on a witch pursuit thing now! [several police cars pull into the parking lot and officers pour out of them] I'm innocent. Please!
1265,21,6,Sgt Yates,"It's over, Stotch. What have you done with the children?"
1266,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"Noho, don't you see?! They're just doing their own witch pursuit thingy now! This is madness! [Chip is heard cackling from up in the air. Everyone looks up to see him flying over Ross Dress For Less, then hug their kids to keep them safe]"
1267,21,6,Chip Duncan,"[lands and gets off the broom] Hey, what's up, bros?"
1268,21,6,Stephen Stotch,"""What's up, bros?"" Chip, do you see all the chaos you've caused?"
1269,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Yeah, so? I'm a witch."
1270,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Ugh, you understand everyone associates us with you, right?"
1271,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Of course they do. You're all witches too, dudes!"
1272,21,6,Steve Black,Not like you!
1273,21,6,Stuart McCormick,What'd you do with the children?
1274,21,6,Chip Duncan,They're all in here! See? [opens his bag]
1275,21,6,Kids,"[voices heard while light emanates from the depth of the bag] Daddy, help! Mommy, help! Ahh!"
1276,21,6,Chip Duncan,I'm going to use their souls to increase my power!
1277,21,6,A townsman,Look! Another witch is flying down now! [a shot of Air Force One flying towards town]
1278,21,6,Stan Marsh,"Butters, come on! We've gotta go!"
1279,21,6,Butters Stotch,Okay! Where?
1280,21,6,Stan Marsh,"I guess our witches were gonna sacrifice your witch, but then the bad witch showed up and now the witch we called just arrived. There's witches everywhere!"
1281,21,6,Butters Stotch,Holy moly! [leaves his chair and follows the others out]
1282,21,6,Randy Marsh,"Look, Chip, if we had known you were gonna hurt people, we would have never even hung out."
1283,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Oh, give me a break, Randy."
1284,21,6,Randy Marsh,"No, seriously."
1285,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Like if one of you guys had the power I have, you wouldn't use it."
1286,21,6,Randy Marsh,No we wouldn't!
1287,21,6,Herbert Garrison,Excuse me. [makes his way to the front of the group]
1288,21,6,Chip Duncan,"Oh, hey man!"
1289,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"You're ruining the party for everyone, Chip! I'm here to take you out!"
1290,21,6,Chip Duncan,[cackles] You'll never stop me! [levitates] I grow more powerful every moment!
1291,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"You wanna see real power? [into his pocket mic disguised as a lapel pin] All right, take the shot. [a solar-powered satellite takes aim at the President's location with three beeps, and two lasers shoot down towards it. The shot obliterates Chip, but his bag and broom fall away unscathed. A few moments of stunned silence, and the witches celebrate as Garrison fist-pumps. Two officers quickly come up and open the bag]"
1292,21,6,Peter,[pops out of the bag] I'm free! [two girls pop out]
1293,21,6,A girl,Mommy! Daddy! [the boy Chip plucked first pops out of the bag]
1294,21,6,Sgt Yates,Is that all of them?
1295,21,6,Cop 2,"There's one more little girl. Come on out, little girl."
1296,21,6,Heidi Turner,Okay. Just a second.
1297,21,6,Cop 2,"Com- come on, little girl. Everyone's waitin' on ya."
1298,21,6,Heidi Turner,Okay. Almost ready. Hang on.
1299,21,6,Eric Cartman,[sighs] It's gonna be a while.
1300,21,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, we did it, guys."
1301,21,6,Ryan Valmer,Everyone will be stoked on us now.
1302,21,6,Randy Marsh,Hey! And there's still a few nights left of Jack and Crack Witch Week.
1303,21,6,Herbert Garrison,"Everybody follow me! I've got tons of Jack, tons of crack, and a jet! [the other witches cheer and follow him to the jet]"
1304,21,6,The Men,"Party's back on! We did it, guys!"
1305,21,6,Randy Marsh,"[looks back at Sharon] Don't wait up, Sharon! I'm gonna party with El Presidente. [Sharon and remaining townspeople are mad]"
1306,21,6,Heidi Turner,All ready to trick or treat?
1307,21,6,Eric Cartman,"[bored] Yeah, no. I've been ready for a couple hours now."
1308,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[expectantly] Yes, Eric?"
1309,21,7,Eric Cartman,[sobbing uncontrollably] Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi! Heidi!-
1310,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Eric, this isn't working."
1311,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Heid- Heidi, no, please! Heidi, Heidi, I would be nothing without you, okay? I'm sorry. Okay? Please!"
1312,21,7,Heidi Turner,You called me a whore and pushed me in front of a car.
1313,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, I was in a bad mood! I told you, that's what happens after I eat! My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra-"
1314,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Eric, you just can't keep being mean to me and blaming it on your blood sugar."
1315,21,7,Eric Cartman,"But ih, but it's true, Heidi! It's all my mom's fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn't know how to process it. Mom! Mom!"
1316,21,7,Liane Cartman,"Yes, hon?"
1317,21,7,Eric Cartman,"You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here!"
1318,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Eric, if blood sugar is really the problem, then you need to change how you ear, right?"
1319,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?"
1320,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Eric, every time I've talked to you about maybe being a vegan with me, you just tell me vegans are pussies. But then you try and blame food and your mom for being-"
1321,21,7,Eric Cartman,"It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please!"
1322,21,7,Heidi Turner,You really mean it?
1323,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Heidi! That's how much I love you! I'm vegan from now on."
1324,21,7,Heidi Turner,"All right, Eric. We'll see how this goes, okay? See you tomorrow."
1325,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Okay, bye, honey. [hangs up]"
1326,21,7,Eric Cartman,"That dirty whore! Who does that bitch think she is?! Packing my lunch for me?! Fuck her, dude!"
1327,21,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Pissed off at your girlfriend again, huh Eric?"
1328,21,7,Eric Cartman,"She's not a girlfriend! She's a controlling, manipulative whore!"
1329,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"That's enough, Cartman! I am so sick of hearing you call Heidi horrible things!"
1330,21,7,Eric Cartman,That's because you don't understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship!
1331,21,7,Heidi Turner,[approaching] Hey babe.
1332,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh hey babe, what's going on?"
1333,21,7,Heidi Turner,What are you up to?
1334,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[uninterested] Nothin', just tellin' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan."
1335,21,7,Heidi Turner,[happy] That's great. You wanna come eat with me? I can explain what I packed.
1336,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, sure. That sounds awesome. [he leaves with her]"
1337,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't get it. I just really don't get it. How is she still supporting him?!
1338,21,7,Stan Marsh,"She loves him, I guess."
1339,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,But he clearly sucks! She has to know he sucks. What the hell is going on?!
1340,21,7,Butters Stotch,"Well, it's not our problem."
1341,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,It is our problem. This is affecting us! Our whole school. There's got to be a reason she sticks by him.
1342,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[spots her and runs up] Oh Heidi? Heidi, you got a sec?"
1343,21,7,Heidi Turner,Oh. Hey Kyle.
1344,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey. Uh, listen, uh... I-I know you and Cartman have an anniversary coming up and, I was just wondering, you know, um. How do you think he's doing? Aaas a boyfriend."
1345,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Well, whattaya mean?"
1346,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, you know, like, some of us are thinking that, uh, maybe he's not super-qualified to be with you?"
1347,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Oh, God, not you too."
1348,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Just, like, what are the things about Cartman that you find remotely redeeming?"
1349,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Look, don't you think I get it enough from my girlfriends? ""He sucks, Heidi. What's wrong with you? Why can't you admit he's a loser? How could anyone ever go with him?"" I was just following my heart. Isn't that what you're supposed to do?"
1350,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,You don't have to get defensive. I just-
1351,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[gets in his face] Who's being defensive?! He's great! We're doing great! I didn't make a bad decision! I don't need you to stand there and say ""I told you so!"" [turns around and walks off]"
1352,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't say ""I... [she whips around again] told you-"""
1353,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[points at him] You know, you don't know what Eric's like when we're alone, okay? He's actually really good to me. [turns around and walks away]"
1354,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,Wooow.
1355,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Heidi! [walks in with a bag of food] Oh my God, you're not gonna believe this."
1356,21,7,Heidi Turner,What?
1357,21,7,Eric Cartman,You were so right [Heidi closes the door] when you said there were vegan options for everything. [puts the food on the table] Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat?
1358,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, the vegan meat that's made with all vegetables and plants."
1359,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, I tried it and you were right. You can't even tell the difference between that and real meat."
1360,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Really? That's great, babe."
1361,21,7,Eric Cartman,So now I've been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It's called Beyond KFC.
1362,21,7,Heidi Turner,Oh wow.
1363,21,7,Eric Cartman,"It's all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it."
1364,21,7,Heidi Turner,[Heidi tries a breaded breast] It tasted just like KFC.
1365,21,7,Eric Cartman,"I know, right?! Isn't that crazy?! [Cartman eats another breaded breast] Like, like seriously, how can you even tell that this was vegan? Try the, try the Beyond Mashed Potatoes and Gravy too. [hands her the mashed potatoes and gravy] They say you can even drink the Beyond Gravy by itself as like a protein boost. [eats some more of his breast while she eats the mashed potatoes and gravy] I don't know about you, but I could eat this every day."
1366,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, it's really good."
1367,21,7,Eric Cartman,[evilly narrowing his eyes to slits] Delicious.
1368,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, listen: I think I know why Heidi won't admit Cartman's a horrible boyfriend."
1369,21,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, are you still on this?"
1370,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! It's important.
1371,21,7,Butters Stotch,"Maybe she's telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don't see."
1372,21,7,Eric Cartman,[running up to them] You guys! You guys! Have you seen Heidi? [walks on past them]
1373,21,7,Stan Marsh,No.
1374,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Well uh, we've been trying some different foods lately and uh, [turns around] Heidi's put on some pounds, you guys."
1375,21,7,Token Black,Heidi's getting fat?
1376,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Token. Don't start rippin' on me for havin' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it. [smiles]"
1377,21,7,Heidi Turner,[walks up behind him] Hey babe.
1378,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What's goin' on? [a surprised look flashes on his face]"
1379,21,7,Heidi Turner,"I-ah, I'm not feeling the best again. [Cartman smiles again] I might see if my mom can come pick me up."
1380,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Pick you up? That could be tough. [a shot at the boys, who just look blankly at him and Heidi. Kyle, though, is not amused]"
1381,21,7,Heidi Turner,"I, I know, but I just feel bloated. I think there might have been something bad in that Beyond Arby's."
1382,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse's office. [the surprised look flashes on his face again, then disappears]"
1383,21,7,Heidi Turner,Can you come with?
1384,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh sure. [they turn around and walk away, but Cartman looks over his shoulder and points at Heidi's bloated figure]"
1385,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,We have to help that girl. Can't you see what's happening?
1386,21,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, it's none of our business."
1387,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,You're wrong. In a way... I think we're all going out with Cartman right now.
1388,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Uh huh. Yeah, I understand that, faggot. And you should understand how my balls are gonna taste when your country starts needing money. I don't give two shits about a treaty. You're a Polish midget. [A knock is heard at the doors] Come in. [three advisers come in - Mike Pence, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell - and Garrison gets back on the phone] Uh huh. Hang, uh hang on. I'm gonna call you back. Yeah, go fuck yourself, retard. [hangs up]"
1389,21,7,Mitch McConnell,"Mr. President, we have a problem. People are pretty upset."
1390,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Hoh, don't tell me people are still made about that nigger thing."
1391,21,7,Mike Pence,"It's pronounced Niger, Mr. President. And it's a country in Africa."
1392,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Oh, aren't we fancy. Okay, I don't want a bunch of [finger quotes] Nigers in Africa aiding terrorists."
1393,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Mr. President, you need to be a little more careful. There's an investigation. A worker with ties to Russia was found raped and executed."
1394,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Raped and executed? Oh, you mean fucked to death? Oh yeah, that was me."
1395,21,7,Mitch McConnell,"Mr. President, people are starting to question your oath to the office."
1396,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"My oath to the office was that I would fuck everyone to death, remember?"
1397,21,7,Memberberries,"Ooo, I 'member. Me too, I 'member. I 'member that."
1398,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"[to the berries] You guys be quiet, [to his advisers] and you guys just get out there and put a positive spin on this whole thing."
1399,21,7,Mitch McConnell,How are we supposed to put a positive spin on it?
1400,21,7,Paul Ryan,It's getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it's time we put our foot down.
1401,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Oooo. [whips out a remote control and presses a button on it, making the doors close and lock automatically. The advisers turn to see this] Hope you brought some condoms."
1402,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello. I know things have been difficult between us lately. I know you think all boys are sort of pigs, but just know that a lot of us boys think girls are amazing and smart and beautiful. [dead air] Not, not like hot-beautiful, I mean like inside-beautiful. I, I'm not saying you're hot. You're not, you're not hot. I'm not saying you're ugly. It doesn't matter- you're all hot on the inside. If we could all just see inside you, it would be hot. [realizes he's out on a limb] Oh, shit."
1403,21,7,Wendy Testaburger,"What do you want, Kyle?"
1404,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,It's Heidi Turner. You guys shouldn't criticize her so much for going with Cartman.
1405,21,7,Annie Knitts,Why not? Eric Cartman's a horrible person.
1406,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I know! I, I know that, okay? Trust me, I hate Cartman as much as any of you, but just, give her some space, you know? You can't keep on saying ""We told you so"", because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasn't dumb."
1407,21,7,Nichole Daniels,Why do you care? Do you like Heidi?
1408,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,No!
1409,21,7,Molly,"Oh my God, he so likes Heidi."
1410,21,7,Lola,Obvi.
1411,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,No I don't! ... Do I?
1412,21,7,Butters Stotch,"[walks up to him] Hey, Kyle. Hey, I was thinkin' about what you said. How we should all help Heidi break up with Eric? You're right, it's our moral obligation."
1413,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, no, we're not getting involved with that."
1414,21,7,Butters Stotch,"Oh, we're not?"
1415,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[stands up]Yeah, no, yeah, I uh dya, I think we need to stay out of it. [walks away]"
1416,21,7,Butters Oh Okay then,Dialog
1417,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, can we talk?"
1418,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Sure, Kyle. What's up? [brings out a harness and puts it on]"
1419,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I just, I hope that maybe you can realize what you have with Heidi and, and just try to be good to her, okay?"
1420,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There's always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it's all part of trying to make each other better. [picks up a big bass drum and straps it onto the harness, then picks up some drumsticks] Someday, maybe you'll have a girlfriend and you'll understand. Oh, here she comes. [at the far end of the hallway, Heidi rounds the corner and walks towards them, and Cartman starts beating the drum] BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi's comin' through."
1421,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[walks up to Cartman] Wha, what are you doing, Eric?"
1422,21,7,Eric Cartman,I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It's his favorite.
1423,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Oh, okay. Um, are we still on for lunch?"
1424,21,7,Eric Cartman,"You betcha, can't wait."
1425,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Okay, see ya. [walks away, vaguely upset]"
1426,21,7,Eric Cartman,[resumes the drum beat] BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!
1427,21,7,Anchor Bill Keegan,"Some concern over the President's competency again today. It was during a Middle East peace conference when the President referred to the people of Saudi Arabia as a bunch of ""dirty sand Nigers"". Though the comments seem divisive, Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, says he's sticking by his President 100%. [next shot is of Paul Ryan with a black eye stained with semen]"
1428,21,7,Reporter,"Speaker Ryan, it's the anniversary of the President being elected. How do you think he's doing?"
1429,21,7,Paul Ryan,Well whattaya mean? He's great. We're doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don't know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don't get to see all his good qualities.
1430,21,7,Reporter,Uh huh. And is that semen on your black eye?
1431,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that's just, that's doorknob cum."
1432,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You doin' okay, Heidi?"
1433,21,7,Heidi Turner,I keep thinking Eric's going to change.
1434,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[sits down next to her and sighs] Heidi, people like Cartman, they always make things someone else's fault. We all wrongly see ourselves as the victims sometimes, but Cartman sees himself as the victim all the time. He'll always find someone to blame for his shortcomings, and because of that, he's never gonna change."
1435,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Before we started going out I was in a really bad place. I felt... pushed away by society. Then this guy came along who told me all the things I wanted to hear, and I just went with it. Does that make me a bad person? [Rihanna's ""Unfaithful"" begins to play]"
1436,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Heidi. Good people make bad decisions every day."
1437,21,7,Heidi Turner,"I've been defending him for so long. I don't know how I'm gonna face people if I finally give up. [next scene is Heidi looking through her scrapbook at the memories she and Cartman created together. His discomfort begins to show in the fourth picture. She closes the book, and her location is shown - she's in bed. Next scene shows her at her locker putting books away when she notices someone looking at her. It's Kyle, looking at her from his locker. He then puts his books into his locker. Next scene shows Heidi and Cartman at the park bench, where she leaves him and he grabs onto her leg to delay her departure. Next scene has Kyle receiving a letter from Heidi. He reads it and smiles. Next scene has Garrison and Xi Jinping holding a news conference, and three bar patrons back at home turning away and crying. Next scene shows the Turners having dinner at a restaurant, in a booth by the window]"
1438,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[sobbing outside the window] Please Heidi! [he pounds on the window a few times before finally sliding down to the ground] Please! [her parents are stunned. Next scene shows Kyle and Heidi on the school swings, chatting away]"
1439,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Hei-... Hei- Hei- Hei-, Hei- .... Hei- [Token slams the door on him. Seconds later the doorbell rings. Token goes back to answer it] Hei-, Hei-, Hei-"
1440,21,7,Token Black,[not happy] What do you want?
1441,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Hei, Hei, Heidi broke up with me, Token."
1442,21,7,Token Black,So?
1443,21,7,Eric Cartman,"I have nothing now, Token. She was my whole world. Can, can I just stay here with you, please?"
1444,21,7,Token Black,What?! Why?! You still have a house!
1445,21,7,Eric Cartman,"I know how you feel now, Token. To be pissed off at the world. To feel completely screwed over by society. I totally get it now. I wanna do what you guys do and go disrespect the flag and flip over cars and stuff. [Again, Token slams the door on him. Again the doorbell rings, and again Token goes to answer it] Token, pleeease! I'm sorry for everything! I really understand now how you guys feel! Please, what time is your family gonna go disrespect the flag and stuff? I wanna go with!"
1446,21,7,Token Black,Get outta here!
1447,21,7,Linda Black,[appears behind Token] What's going on?
1448,21,7,Token Black,"[upset with Cartman] Nothing, Mom."
1449,21,7,Eric Cartman,Heidi broke up with meeeeee.
1450,21,7,Linda Black,"Token, he's freezing. [to Cartman] Come on in out of the snow."
1451,21,7,Eric Cartman,[entering] Thank youuuu.
1452,21,7,Token Black,...NO!!
1453,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Okay, we're safe to talk."
1454,21,7,Mike Pence,"It's not safe! Nowhere is safe, don't you understand?! We're all about to get killed!"
1455,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Sshh, keep your voices down! Look at this!"
1456,21,7,Mike Pence,What are all these numbers?
1457,21,7,Paul Ryan,"The latest approval ratings. I've been researching our own independent poll. The President is tanking. These numbers are so low that we just might have an out. Well, don't you guys see what this means?"
1458,21,7,Mitch McConnell,"I don't know anything, I'm just a turtle."
1459,21,7,Paul Ryan,It means that the swing voters are turning against him. It's those people that matter. Those are the ones who can finally turn this thing around!
1460,21,7,Mitch McConnell,And then we don't have to get killed! We can't let the President know about this. just let him- [the door opens]
1461,21,7,Herbert Garrison,[walks in] What are you guys talkin' about?
1462,21,7,Mike Pence,"No, nothing, Mr. President."
1463,21,7,Paul Ryan,Nothing!
1464,21,7,Mitch McConnell,"No, nope!"
1465,21,7,Herbert Garrison,Just having' a little chat or somethin'?
1466,21,7,Mike Pence,"[looks at the folder Pence is holding, takes it, and walks over to the President] It's an opinion poll, Mr. President. Your numbers are down and I wanted to show you so you could do something."
1467,21,7,Paul Ryan,"Oh, you bitch! [to the President] I was the one who researched the poll, Mr. President!"
1468,21,7,Herbert Garrison,"Let me see that. [takes the folder and leafs through it] Huh. Isn't that interesting? But it's not a problem. See, I know something about societal psychology that you three turd balls don't. Everything's gonna be fine."
1469,21,7,Eric Cartman,So... You guys about done with the soup?
1470,21,7,Linda Black,"Don't you like it, Eric?"
1471,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Well yeah, no, it's great. It's just- well, what time do you guys usually go out and disrespect the flag and stuff?"
1472,21,7,Steve Black,What?
1473,21,7,Eric Cartman,Oh no... Don't tell me you guys already disrespected the flag and flipped over cars today. Did I miss it?
1474,21,7,Steve Black,What the hell are you talking about?!
1475,21,7,Token Black,I told you not to let him in.
1476,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Please, I don't know what to do with all this anger and hurt!"
1477,21,7,Linda Black,"I'm sorry your girlfriend broke up with you, Eric, but... maybe you'll get back together."
1478,21,7,Eric Cartman,"No, no, we've broken up before, but this time it's different. I can tell. Something's changed with her. Heidi won't even answer my phone calls."
1479,21,7,Steve Black,Heidi? Turner? The Turners' daughter?
1480,21,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah...
1481,21,7,Steve Black,I thought she was with that Kyle Broflovski kid.
1482,21,7,Eric Cartman,[sadness switches to anger in a flash] What?
1483,21,7,Steve Black,I saw them at the park today holding hands.
1484,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[dramatic music begins] Kyle? Kyle?! Kyle!! [a montage begins with five marching happy Kyles appearing] Kyle! Kyle! Kyle Kyle Kyle! [a big red heart appears and breaks, and a line of smiling Kyles marches out of it in shades of pink. Next scene is a Jewish dance performed by hasidim. Next scene is Cartman out on the street striking a match...] Kyle! [...and burning a giant flag on the ground with it.] Kyle! [the flames spread to fill up the screen. The next scene shows a cackling Kyle coming up out of the water like a giant sea monster as Eric and Heidi hold on to each other. Kyle holds a menorah reminiscent of a trident. Next scene is another group of hasidim dancing] Kyle! [next scene is Cartman and Heidi running away, only to be stopped by Kyle popping up before them like an exploding volcano, cackling. Cartman and Heidi turn and run away again, but the ground around them is compromised and Kyle's shadow covers them both as they look up at him. Next scene is back at the dining room at Token's mansion] Kyle..."
1485,21,7,Steve Black,"Yeah, Kyle."
1486,21,7,Eric Cartman,KYLE! [the other kids in the hallway clear the way as Cartman appears at the end of the hallway behind Kyle. Dramatic Western showdown music plays] I should have known. You lying snake!
1487,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around] Cartman, I didn't mean for things to happen the way they did."
1488,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Did it bother you that I was happy?! Is that why you took her from me, Kyle?!"
1489,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you weren't happy."
1490,21,7,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle!"
1491,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,All you did was bitch about her all the time.
1492,21,7,Eric Cartman,"You're not gonna talk your way out of this one! This is the end, Kyle! It's you and me!"
1493,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Cartman. I-"
1494,21,7,Eric Cartman,[slams Kyle into the lockers] You took everything from me!
1495,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,Stop it!
1496,21,7,Eric Cartman,All you've ever done is work to ruin my life! Well now I'm finally gonna fight back!
1497,21,7,Butters Stotch,"Fuck him up, Eric!"
1498,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[goes in for the attack] Aaah! [Kyle delivers a punch] Ugh! [Cartman goes down straight away] Fuck you, Kyle!"
1499,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Cartman. You just have to accept that Heidi's moved on."
1500,21,7,Molly,"Guys, I just wanna say, here's to Heidi. Welcome back to the land of the living."
1501,21,7,The other girls,Yay Heidi!
1502,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[giggles] Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking me out. This is really fun."
1503,21,7,Red,No worries. We're just glad you finally came to your senses.
1504,21,7,Annie Knitts,"Yeah, no kidding. We seriously thought you might marry that piece of shit! [the girls laugh]"
1505,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[a bit sheepish] Well, you know, he- he actually had some good qualities too."
1506,21,7,Red,"Uhh, yeah, like what? Racism?"
1507,21,7,Bebe Stevens,Or the sociopath part?
1508,21,7,Courtney,"Yeah. I mean, no offense, Heidi, but what the fuck were you thinking?"
1509,21,7,Lola,"Guys, she admitted she made a mistake."
1510,21,7,Molly,You make a mistake on your homework. What Heidi did was more like a momentary loss of all sanity. [the girls laugh]
1511,21,7,Heidi Turner,[feeling pushed away again] It was just what I believed in.
1512,21,7,Bebe Stevens,"Don't worry, Heidi. We're not gonna keep telling you we told you so."
1513,21,7,Lola,But we told you so. [the girls laugh]
1514,21,7,Bebe Stevens,The only thing I wanna know is... how did you bring yourself to actually KISS him?
1515,21,7,The girls,Eewwww!
1516,21,7,Red,Can you imagine? Eric Cartman's breath on your mouth?
1517,21,7,The girls,"Ew, ugh! [this is depressing Heidi as sad music begins to play]"
1518,21,7,Courtney,"[imitating Cartman] Heidi, come here. I want to kiss you with my tongue!"
1519,21,7,The girls,"Ew, ugh! [they laugh as Heidi wilts]"
1520,21,7,Heidi Turner,Hi Eric.
1521,21,7,Eric Cartman,What are you doing here?
1522,21,7,Heidi Turner,I don't know. I think I- I just wanna make sure... you're doing okay. I want you to know I'll always care about you.
1523,21,7,Eric Cartman,"[sniffles] That's good to know, 'cause like, nothing helps more when you're down than knowing that your girlfriend who broke up with you might care."
1524,21,7,Heidi Turner,[sits next to him] I'm sorry that I've hurt you. I think maybe I am just stupid and I don't know what I want and it ends up hurting people.
1525,21,7,Eric Cartman,"No... You need to know something, Heidi. None of this is your fault."
1526,21,7,Heidi Turner,But I'm the one who-
1527,21,7,Eric Cartman,"No. Heidi, none of this is your fault. There's stuff I never told you. It's time... It's time I did."
1528,21,7,Heidi Turner,Hey.
1529,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! You all set to go?
1530,21,7,Heidi Turner,[walks in] I wanted to talk to you first.
1531,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, sure."
1532,21,7,Heidi Turner,"Kyle, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and it was all making me really confused."
1533,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, that's understandable."
1534,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[turns and holds his hands] I was being manipulated, and I didn't even see it. I never do. And, I don't think you saw it either, Kyle."
1535,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean?
1536,21,7,Heidi Turner,"I've come to realize that it's not my fault. It's your fault, Kyle. You made all this happen. Made me question who I was."
1537,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"But Heidi, I thought-"
1538,21,7,Heidi Turner,"[puts her index finger on his lips] Shh. [walks away] But it's okay. You can't help it. It's how you were raised, what you were taught. My heritage is Irish, so I'm prone to being moody. And your heritage... well, you know... you can be a little sneaky sometimes and not even realize it. [turns left to walk out the door] I'm sorry, Kyle, but everybody's trying to live life the best they can. It's hard enough without your people always trying to get ahead. [walks out and closes the door]"
1539,21,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude... did she just call me a dirty Jew? [he walks to the window to see her walk away, and sees Cartman waiting for her. Cartman sees him at the window. Heidi meets Cartman and they walk away together, with Cartman looking over his shoulder at Kyle with a smug look on his face]"
1540,21,7,Mike Pence,Happy anniversary to you.
1541,21,7,Paul Ryan,Happy anniversary to you.
1542,21,7,Mitch McConnell,Happy anniversary to you.
1543,21,7,Mitch McConnell,Cha cha cha.
1544,21,7,Mike Pence,Happy anniversary to you.
1545,21,7,Paul Ryan,Happy anniversary to you.
1546,21,7,Mitch McConnell,Happy anniversary to you.
1547,21,7,Mitch McConnell,Cha cha cha.
1548,21,8,Counselor Steve,"Okay guys, it's November and who can tell me what that means? [points] Yes, Francis?"
1549,21,8,Francis,It's time for the Special Ed Science Fair. [the other kids cheer]
1550,21,8,Counselor Steve,"That's right, the Science Fair is this weekend, and I know you're all very excited to show the projects you've been working on. [more cheers] This week we'll be hearing all about your projects and first up we have Nathan and Mimallah. [amid some applause and chatter, Nathan and Mimsy walk in with their project, a volcano]"
1551,21,8,Nathan,"For our science fait project, we will be showing the destructive force of nature by simulating a volcano!"
1552,21,8,The kids,Ooooooh.
1553,21,8,Nathan,"With vinegar and baking soda, we will make this paper-mch volcano EXPLODE."
1554,21,8,The kids,Aaaaaaa.
1555,21,8,Nathan,With the power and fury of Mount Kilauea. Our science fair project is sure to be... a blast. Get it? A. Blast.
1556,21,8,Counselor Steve,"All right, what do you guys think of Nathan and Mimallah's project idea? [the kids clap and cheer]"
1557,21,8,Nathan,"We've done it, Mimsy. We're gonna win the science fair for sure. And then, every chick in this school is gonna wanna have sex with us."
1558,21,8,Mimsy,"Uh, gee boss, I don't know about sex with no chicken."
1559,21,8,Nathan,"[smack] Not those chicks, numbskull. I'm talkin' 'bout bitches. You know what girls like? They like winners. And when we win the science fair, we're gonna be up to our ears in pussy."
1560,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Is it just me, or are things around here getting worse and worse?"
1561,21,8,Millie Larsen,It's definitely not just you. I think everyone's in shock that Heidi went back to Cartman.
1562,21,8,Theresa,What keeps driving her back to him? It's so weird.
1563,21,8,Isla,She's so... mean and angry these days.
1564,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"People change. They say you become more and more like the person you're with and, I guess it's true with Heidi."
1565,21,8,Heidi Turner,[joins the girls at the table] Hey guys. What's up?
1566,21,8,Isla,"Hey, Heidi."
1567,21,8,Heidi Turner,What are you guys talkin' about?
1568,21,8,Nichole Daniels,Nothing.
1569,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Bullcrap, you're all talkin' about me again. 'Cause you're judgmental bitches. [burps] Ehhh."
1570,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Heidi, are you okay? It's just... you look..."
1571,21,8,Heidi Turner,I look what?
1572,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"Ngh, you know, y-you just look-"
1573,21,8,Heidi Turner,"What? I look fat? Is that what you wanna say, Wendy? Fuck you, bitch!"
1574,21,8,Theresa,"She's just concerned, Heidi."
1575,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[mimicking] ""Mehmehmehmehmehhh, Heidi"". I'm just trying to enjoy my lunch here! Can I do it without you guys shitting on all over me?!"
1576,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"All right, good, Timmy. Test 42a is successful. Let's move on to the next phase. [Nathan and Mimsy walk in]"
1577,21,8,Nathan,"Well hello, gentlemen."
1578,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh hey fellas, we're doing great."
1579,21,8,Timmy Burch,Timmih!
1580,21,8,Nathan,Thought we'd stop by to see how your- science fair project is going.
1581,21,8,Mimsy,"Dah I thought we was comin' to rub their faces in how good our science fair project was, boss."
1582,21,8,Nathan,"[gets mad, then smacks Mimsy] Shut up, Mimsyyy! [to Jimmy and Timmy] So what are you guys workin' on?"
1583,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, it's fantastic. This year, Tim-Tim and I are doin' our project on [looks into the microscope] water bears."
1584,21,8,Nathan,"Oh. Water bears. [backs up to Mimsy] You hear that, Mimsy? Like there's any such things as water bears. That blue science fair ribbon is as good as ours. [to Jimmy and Timmy] Well, we've gotta get back to our lava volcano. Good luck finding your, pft, water bears. [he and Mimsy turn around to walk out]"
1585,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, would you like to see them?"
1586,21,8,Nathan,[he and Mimsy stop and turn] What? Uh what are you talking about?
1587,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Timmy and I have gathered thousands of water bears. Take a look in the microscope. [Nathan steps forward to look into the microscope. He sees some water bears swimming around on the specimen slide. Jimmy continues] Water bears are water-dwelling, eight-legged micro-animals."
1588,21,8,Timmy Burch,Timmah.
1589,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"They're one of nature's most resilient animals. [next slide] Studies have shown they can survive lava, and even the vacuum of space."
1590,21,8,Nathan,What-? How-? [looks up] Where the fuck did you learn about these things?
1591,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,Where all good scientists learn from. Octonauts.
1592,21,8,Timmy Burch,Octonauts!
1593,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,Some scientists believe the study of water bears is key to human survival.
1594,21,8,Mimsy,"Aw jeez, that sounds a lot better than a lava volcano, huh boss?"
1595,21,8,Nathan,"Well, not really, because the science fair is supposed to be an experiment. I fail to see what the experiment is here."
1596,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, that's easy. You see, for the past several weeks, Tim-Tim and me have been training the water bears to respond to different sound waves. We found that they respond best to Taylor Swift. Hit it, Timmy. [Timmy presses a button offscreen, and Taylor Swift's ""Look What You Made Me Do"" begins to play] Take a look. [the Water Bears soon form a circle of eight of them on the specimen slide. Timmy turns off the player] We still have some training to do, but we're excited about the results. I have to admit, your lava volcano is pretty great too. Maybe we could tie for first place. [Nathan looks at Jimmy, then at Timmy, in shock]"
1597,21,8,Mr. Mackey,Come in.
1598,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[enters the office] You wanted to see me, Mr. Mackey?"
1599,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Oh yes, Heidi, uh, we just wanted to see if you have transportation to the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend, or if you wanted us to set somethin' up for you."
1600,21,8,Heidi Turner,What?
1601,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"...Uh, Saturday is the science fair, and, you're the judge for the competition?"
1602,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Judge a special needs science fair? Ahem, no thanks."
1603,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Well, Heidi, is there a problem with you bein' the judge this weekend?"
1604,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Uhh, yeah? It's Saturday, and I don't wanna be at skewl?"
1605,21,8,Mr. Mackey,But you're always the judge of the Special Ed Science Fair because you're our best science student.
1606,21,8,Heidi Turner,So now I'm gonna be punished by being force to judge a bunch of handicapped kids?!
1607,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"But... Okay, you see, the problem is that you volunteered last month, Heidi. You said you wanted to do it, m'kay?"
1608,21,8,Heidi Turner,Well how can you expect students to commit to things a month in advance?! [puts away a stray lock of hair under her cap] I don't even know what I want for dinner tonight.
1609,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Look, the kids have worked really hard and have done some amazing projects."
1610,21,8,Heidi Turner,You're gonna force me to come to skewl on a Saturday?!
1611,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Heidi, eh... is everything all right?"
1612,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Oh what? Are you gonna call me fat now too?! It just so happens I'm a vegan, which means it'd difficult for me to get enough protein, so my body doesn't burn fat, it burns muscle, which makes it look like I'm fat, but I'm actually WAY healthier than any of YOU!!"
1613,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"Heidi, you're judging the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend."
1614,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Oh, Goddammit!"
1615,21,8,Nathan,[looks around] Mimsy! Come on! [reaches the door]
1616,21,8,Mimsy,Okay Nathan. [joins him]
1617,21,8,Nathan,"Shhh, shut the fuck up! [picks the lock and opens the door. They go in, look around, then go to Jimmy and Timmy's project]"
1618,21,8,Mimsy,"Gee, we could get in a lot of trouble. Ya, you sure we should mess with Jimmy and Timmy's science fair project?"
1619,21,8,Nathan,"Mimsy, do you know what Jimmy is? He's a cock blocker."
1620,21,8,Mimsy,Eh what's a cock blocker?
1621,21,8,Nathan,"Every time I come up with a way to score with the ladies, there's Jimmy tryin' to one-up me. This science fair is supposed to finally make us successful enough to get chicks."
1622,21,8,Mimsy,"D'aw, gee, I don't know if we should use our position of power to exploit women."
1623,21,8,Nathan,"... [smacks Mimsy] I'm not letting those assholes win the science fair! [opens a medical bag] That's why I say, the only good water bears are dead water bears. [pulls out a bottle of lighter fluid and pours it into the tardigrade tank, then follows that up with a bottle of lye. He then gets a curling iron, plugs it in and turns it on, and sticks it into the tank, where it sparks and causes a chemical reaction] Let's go! [they run out of the bungalow as the reaction continues inside]"
1624,21,8,Heidi Turner,This is bullcrap! How can they force me to be the science fair judge?! Now I know how it feels to be a slave!
1625,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"It's... not exactly like being a slave, Heidi."
1626,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Yes it is! Am I being paid to judge the science fair? No. Do I have a choice? No. ""Ohhh, yes masah. Lemme judge that science fair for ya, suh!"""
1627,21,8,Theresa,"God, will you stop?!"
1628,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Theresa, don't get all aggro on me because you're pissed off your family lives in a trailer."
1629,21,8,Theresa,My family doesn't live in a trailer. We live in a tiny home. My parents downsized to make a smaller footprint on the environment.
1630,21,8,Heidi Turner,That's what I said. Your family lives in a trailer.
1631,21,8,Theresa,There's lots of progressive people living in tiny homes. There's five others on my block.
1632,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Right. That's called a ""trailer park."""
1633,21,8,Theresa,A-hi don't live in a trailer park!
1634,21,8,Wendy Testaburger,"[to Theresa, about Heidi] Just don't even respond to her. Just ignore her."
1635,21,8,Heidi Turner,"I'll try, but she's such a bitch."
1636,21,8,Isla,"She wasn't talking to you, Heidi."
1637,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Oh, looks like Isla has something to say, you guys. Hold on, I'm sure this is going to be really profound. Go ahead, Isla, knock us out with you wit and satire. This should be good, you guys."
1638,21,8,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Heidi] Hey Heidi, what's up?"
1639,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[uninterested] Oh hey babe, what's going on?"
1640,21,8,Eric Cartman,What are you up to?
1641,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[her voice trails off] Nothiiing, just talking to my girlfriends about tiny homes."
1642,21,8,Nathan,"Well hello there, ladies."
1643,21,8,Nelly,"Oh, hi Nathan."
1644,21,8,Nathan,We just wanted to remind you [hand Nichole a flyer] that this weekend is the Special Ed Science Fair.
1645,21,8,Nichole Daniels,"Oh, cool."
1646,21,8,Nathan,"Yeah, that's right. Pretty soon you'll all be impressed with what you see. Hope you can make it. [walks off with Mimsy. Moments later...] Did you see that, Mimsy? The way those girls bit their bottom lips when I said ""science fair""? We're about to be drowning in muff."
1647,21,8,Francis,"Nathan! Mimallah! Yuh, you've gotta get to Special Ed!"
1648,21,8,Nathan,Special Ed class isn't for another two hours.
1649,21,8,Francis,"Nono, you've gotta see this! Jimmy and Timmy's water bears! They've changed!"
1650,21,8,Nathan,What?
1651,21,8,Counselor Steve,"Jimmy and Timmy, this is incredible! You've somehow made them even smarter. [Francis, Nathan and Mimsy enter]"
1652,21,8,Nathan,What's goin' on?
1653,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Nathan, it's amazing. The water bears we've trained are starting to display social advancements."
1654,21,8,Mimsy,But they're supposed to be dead. [Nathan smacks him]
1655,21,8,Nathan,[walks up to Jimmy and Timmy's table] What social advancement?
1656,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,They've actually evolved to the point of doing the hokey pokey.
1657,21,8,Nathan,"The hokey pokey? [looks down into the microscope and sees the tardigrades. ""The Hokey Pokey"" plays as the water bears begin synchronized dancing] You've gotta be fucking kidding me."
1658,21,8,Counselor Steve,"Boys, this might be the single greatest Special Ed Science Fair project I've ever seen!"
1659,21,8,Heidi Turner,Butters.
1660,21,8,Butters Stotch,Whoa. [turns around] Uh hey.
1661,21,8,Heidi Turner,How would you like to be the judge for the Special Ed Science Fair this weekend?
1662,21,8,Butters Stotch,"Uhh, I can't. I'm going to a birthday party."
1663,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, don't be a dick!"
1664,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Yeah, don't make up excuses because judging handicapped students sounds terrible!"
1665,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, Butters! God! [rolls his eyes]"
1666,21,8,Clyde Donovan,[walks up to Heidi and Cartman] He's not making it up. It's my birthday party.
1667,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Well then, could you invite Heidi, please? She needs an excuse not to have to go to the Special Needs Science Fair."
1668,21,8,Stan Marsh,[walks into view with Kyle] What's wrong with supporting them? They're our friends.
1669,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Because nobody wants to be trapped, in a gym, with Special Ed Science."
1670,21,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Actually, some of their projects are pretty cool."
1671,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle! [to each other] Samesies! [they kiss each other on the lips]"
1672,21,8,and Heidi,"Shut up, Kyle! [to each other] Samesies! [they kiss each other on the lips]"
1673,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Look, it's all just a complete waste of time! It's not like the Special Ed Science Fair is actually gonna contribute to society. [a helicopter is heard over the school. In front of the school, the helicopter lands on the lawn as several black cars and vans roll up to the school. A bunch of men in black suits get out of the vehicles and walk into school]"
1674,21,8,Jerry Jones,"[leading the men] Move. Move aside, kids. Official business!"
1675,21,8,An NFL owner,"Move it, children. [the kids make way for the NFL owners]"
1676,21,8,PC Principal,"Excuse me, can I help you?"
1677,21,8,Jerry Jones,We understand that you're about to have a science fair with some very interesting experiments.
1678,21,8,PC Principal,"That's right, the science fair is this Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm."
1679,21,8,Jerry Jones,We're here to help however we can. Your special ed department has all our resources and all our support. This science fair... just might be what saves us all.
1680,21,8,Heidi Turner,"What the hell is going on?! Everywhere I turn, people are being given handouts while I'm forced to work my ass off! It's total bullshit!"
1681,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah... uh... Babe, uh I understand that you're pissed off, but, um, you know, it is recess. Maybe we should relax and have some fun?"
1682,21,8,Heidi Turner,[stops pacing] Relax?! How can I relax?! I get straight A's! I ace every test! And who gets all the support?! The Special Ed Department!
1683,21,8,Jerry Jones,Good. Bring it on in. These kids need to have access to everything they need.
1684,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Wow, look at this, Tim-Tim. They've all been researching water bears too."
1685,21,8,Jerry Jones,"That's correct. [two workers roll up a whiteboard with a diagram of a tardigrade on it, with parts of the body clearly labeled] Like you, we've come to realize that water bears are the key to our future. [walks up to the project right after Jimmy and Timmy do] Are these the special water bears that we read about on your school message board?"
1686,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,That's right. The water bears we've been working with appear to be evolving somehow.
1687,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Then they are the key to our survival, boys."
1688,21,8,Nathan,"Gentlemen, perhaps I can interest you in a lava volcano. You won't believe your eyes when I add some simple baking soda."
1689,21,8,Jerry Jones,"[turns to face him] There's no time for that! We need everyone working on Jimmy and Timmy's project. I'm gonna let you kids all in on a little secret. We don't wanna create a panic, but... the End is very near. And we have very little time."
1690,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Fellow students, I have asked to speak today because of the hypocrisy and bullying that is coming from the administration at this so called... skewl. It is an outrage that our principal and counselor denand our participation in privileged programs that are outrageously overfunded. Why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to special needs students? Are the rest of us not special? If we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs, then soon we will all be poor, and forced to live in a trailer park like Theresa."
1691,21,8,Theresa,It's not a trailer!
1692,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Theresa, [that lock of hair comes down again] get over it, you live in a trailer park, it's not a big deal. [she puts the lock back in place]"
1693,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, o-okay honey, you're kind of getting off-topic, sweetie."
1694,21,8,Heidi Turner,What did you say?!
1695,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh just, uh-uhm, I just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with."
1696,21,8,Heidi Turner,GET THIS OVER WITH?! You're supposed to be supporting me!
1697,21,8,Eric Cartman,"I am supporting you, sweetheart!"
1698,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Being supportive doesn't mean you criticize me, asshole! Just forget it! My point is, if the school administration doesn't cancel the science fair, I will see to it that they are all fired for discrimination!"
1699,21,8,Mr. Mackey,"[standing by the gym doors, to PC Principal] She's... kind of like Cartman, but with the ability to follow through."
1700,21,8,PC Principal,"Oh, dude. Bro."
1701,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Francis, can you hand me the sound wave generator? [Frances hands it to him]"
1702,21,8,Nathan,This is bullshit! The Special Ed Science Fair is turning into a lovefest for Jimmy and Timmy's project! They're gonna get all the fame and glory!
1703,21,8,Mimsy,"D'aw, I guess we kind of shot ourselves in the foot, huh boss? If it weren't for us, those water bears wouldn't have even gotten smarter in the first place."
1704,21,8,Nathan,"[stops and thinks] Hey, Mimsy, that's right. They don't deserve the credit, we do. [speaks up] Uh, excuse me. If you're all trying to figure out why these water bears are different, you're talking to the wrong guys. [Everyone turns to face him]"
1705,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Wha-what do you mean, Nathan?"
1706,21,8,Nathan,Mimsy and I did some experimenting with the water bears on our own.
1707,21,8,Mimsy,We was tryin' to kill 'em. [smack]
1708,21,8,Nathan,"It was us who made them evolve, so we should be the ones working for the government."
1709,21,8,Jerry Jones,The government? Wuh we aren't the government.
1710,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,Yuh you're not the government? But you said you were here to help stop us from becoming extinct.
1711,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Not you, us. We're with... the NFL. Our fans are leaving at an exponential rate. We've been hit with anthem protests, protests of those protests, and worst of all, concussions. The more reports that come out, the more people are getting turned off by football. We've been experimenting with water bears because... we believe they are our last hope."
1712,21,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Oh, I get it. You've been experimenting with water bears to see how to make humans more impervious to concussions."
1713,21,8,Jerry Jones,No. We've been experimenting with water bears to try and make them... FANS.
1714,21,8,Sportscaster 1,A beautiful night for football here in Los Angeles as the Chargers take on the Buffalo Bills.
1715,21,8,Sportscaster 2,"And a record sellout crowd here at the stadium. Football clearly more popular than over with a whopping 17 million in attendance. [shown are a smattering of fans, with the rest of the seats being occupied by small tanks of tardigrades]"
1716,21,8,Sportscaster 1,"The NFL, of course, working really hard to reach new viewers, and it looks like they found their answer in tardigrades."
1717,21,8,Sportscaster 2,"[a camera crew focuses on one tank] The water bears are thrilled to be here and of course, love seeing themselves on the Jumbotron. [which shows that tank's sea bears onscreen] They're all ready for some football and enjoying the fan favorite Kiss Cam. [two tardigrades are shown kissing]"
1718,21,8,Sportscaster 1,And we're ready for kickoff as the cheers of 17 million fans rock the stadium! [the Chargers kick off and the Bills catch the football and begin their charge. Nothing but crickets are heard as a Bills player is taken down]
1719,21,8,Jerry Jones,We're running out of time. We have to see if these water bears truly are different. Insert the box. [a fellow owner grabs a microscopic box with tweezers and carries it over to the table. He puts it into the specimen slide] Gently. What do you see now? [the tweezers are removed]
1720,21,8,Nathan,"Ahhh, Iii see the box. [a microscopic FedEx box] What, what's in the box?"
1721,21,8,Jerry Jones,What are the water bears doing?
1722,21,8,Nathan,"Uhhh, they're just walkin' around and ubb, oh wait! They appear to be interested in the box."
1723,21,8,Jerry Jones,"These water bears are different. [the classroom door opens and in walk Heidi, Cartman, Mr. Mackey and PC Principal]"
1724,21,8,PC Principal,"All right, everyone, listen up. Give me your attention please. Due to circumstances beyond our control, we are cancelling the Special Ed Science Fair. [the students begin to talk amongst themselves]"
1725,21,8,Owners,What? Cancelling?
1726,21,8,Jerry Jones,You can't cancel the science fair. We're on the verge of a breakthrough here.
1727,21,8,Heidi Turner,It's cancelled. You guys can get all this shit out of here and leave. Thank you!
1728,21,8,Jerry Jones,You don't understand! The Special Ed Science Fair is our only hope!
1729,21,8,Mr Mackey,"Oh I'm sorry, but um, our hands are tied... by Heidi. [Jones and the other owners whip out their guns]"
1730,21,8,Jerry Jones,I think you all fail to see the seriousness of our situation! Football is dying!
1731,21,8,Mr Mackey,"[he and PC Principal put their hands up] Whoa, whoa whoa, okay."
1732,21,8,Jerry Jones,[to another owner] Close the door! [the owner closes the door] Everyone back to work! Nobody... [two special ed kids and Cartman slip out of view] will stop this Special Ed Science Fair!
1733,21,8,Another owner,[with his gun aimed at Nathan] Do what he says!
1734,21,8,Nathan,"Oh! Uh okay, Jesus Christ!"
1735,21,8,Heidi Turner,[finds Cartman] Are you just gonna stand there?! Do something!
1736,21,8,Eric Cartman,What the hell do you want me to do?!
1737,21,8,Heidi Turner,I want you to have some BALLS and act like you care about me!
1738,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, you need to stop being such a bitch!"
1739,21,8,Heidi Turner,[gets closer to him] Call me a bitch again! Do it! [gets in his face] Call me a bitch again!
1740,21,8,Eric Cartman,You are... acting... like a... bad girlfriend.
1741,21,8,Heidi Turner,That's what I thought!
1742,21,8,Nathan,"Hey, uh wait a minute! The water bears have changed again. I think it's working."
1743,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Let me see that! [looks through the microscope] Yes. Yes, they're starting to adapt. [the water bears now sport jerseys from various teams. He increases the magnification] Sonofabitch, we just might have ourselves some fans! [stands up] Now quickly, children! We must replicate these water bears to create more! [Nathan gets back on the microscope]"
1744,21,8,Heidi Turner,"If nobody else is going to do anything, I will! [runs up to the microscope, yanks the fish bowl from it, and runs to the door]"
1745,21,8,Nathan,Wha-ah?
1746,21,8,An owner,The water bears!
1747,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Heidi! Heidi, will you please listen to me?!"
1748,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Move it! Get the fuck out of the way! I said get out of the way, you assholes! [followiong are the NFL owners, the special ed kids, Mr. Mackey and PC Principal, ...and Cartman]"
1749,21,8,Another owner,"We got the fat girl, front of the school."
1750,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Shit! [turns around and goes back inside, only to see all the people chasing her down]"
1751,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Little girl, stop! [Heidi begins to pant] It doesn't have to end this way."
1752,21,8,Eric Cartman,"[makes his way to the front of the group] Move aside! Move aside! [finally sees Heidi] Heidi, seriously, you need to listen to me!"
1753,21,8,Heidi Turner,I don't... have to listen... to anybody!
1754,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes, yes you do! You need to listen!"
1755,21,8,Heidi Turner,Fuck you!
1756,21,8,Eric Cartman,"No, fuck you!"
1757,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Little girl, please! What you have in your hand is very special."
1758,21,8,Heidi Turner,Well I'm sick of everyone treating me like shit!
1759,21,8,Jerry Jones,Think about the NFL. How much joy it brings to everyone!
1760,21,8,Nathan,Don't listen to them. Give the water bears to me. I deserve all the fame and bitches.
1761,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Heidi, you've gotta stop being so angry."
1762,21,8,Jerry Jones,"Look, if you- if you don't do it for the NFL, what about humanity? Those creatures are showing the first signs of sentience. Think about what they could mean for science. For medicine. Making people better."
1763,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Come on, babe. We all want the old Heidi back. [Heidi looks up at the balcony and notices Wendy, Theresa, and Isla looking down upon her]"
1764,21,8,Heidi Turner,"[looks down at the water bears, then looks up again] Screw all you guys!"
1765,21,8,NFL Owners,"NOOOO! [Heidi chugs the fish bowl down like a college student, wipes her lips, then burps]"
1766,21,8,Special Ed kids,"NOOOO! [Heidi chugs the fish bowl down like a college student, wipes her lips, then burps]"
1767,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, wwow."
1768,21,8,Heidi Turner,[angrily] Is there something you wanna talk about?
1769,21,8,Eric Cartman,"No. I was just... trying to... figure out why you decided to drink 20,000 microanimals that were showing signs of intelligence."
1770,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Whatever. It's Saturday, and I'm not in skewl."
1771,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you're, you're not in skewl."
1772,21,8,Heidi Turner,[goes back to eating chips] How come we never snuggle anymore?!
1773,21,8,Eric Cartman,"[alarmed] Wha, what?"
1774,21,8,Heidi Turner,We used to snuggle all the time and it's totally gone away! What happened?!
1775,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, but honey, we still-"
1776,21,8,Heidi Turner,SNUGGLE!
1777,21,8,Eric Cartman,"[gets closer to her] Yes yes, let's, let's snuggle, yes. [she shares her blanket and snuggles]"
1778,21,8,Heidi Turner,"Goddammit, how come there's nothin' to watch on Saturday but kids cartoons?!"
1779,21,8,Blue Horse on TV,"Hohall right, kids. Now let's do the hokey pokey. [begins to sing the song]"
1780,21,8,Heidi Turner,Oooo. [her belly begins to move to the music] What's goin' on in here?
1781,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, what is goin' on in here?"
1782,21,8,Heidi Turner,I feel somethin' moving around. I-it- [farts]
1783,21,8,Eric Cartman,Yeesh. [backs away]
1784,21,8,Heidi Turner,[farts again] SNUGGLE!
1785,21,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, honey. [gets close to her again, but she farts again] Eughah, ah."
1786,21,8,Roger Goodell,"Well, did you have any luck, Mr. Jones?"
1787,21,8,Jerry Jones,"I'm afraid, Commissioner, that the Special Ed Science Fair failed to produce more viable water bears."
1788,21,8,Officlal 1,Then the NFL truly has no hope.
1789,21,8,Officlal 2,We're done for.
1790,21,8,Jerry Jones,Not quite. [a lab worker wheels something in and leaves] We were able to obtain somethin' else [picks up a beaker] that just might be our future. [pours the beaker into the volcano Nathan offered to him earlier]
1791,21,9,Netflix President,"Welcome to Netflix. [smiles] Last year we approved 16 original shows and movies; and this year, it is our goal to make that number 1,087. That's why we here at Netflix are thrilled to be working with you two comedy geniuses, Terrance & Phillip. [Terrance & Phillip are shown, now as elderly gentlemen. Terrance raises his left leg slowly and lets out a wet fart. The president laughs and claps] Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Classic stuff. Now go ahead and pitch what you're thinking for your Netflix original series."
1792,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,"Well, we were thinkin' that we'd do a show where Phillip and I are on a farm... with a cow."
1793,21,9,President,"[still enthused] Okay, I love it so far."
1794,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,[slowly] The sun is just starting to come up and then... I fart on Phillip.
1795,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,"[slowly] And I say, ""Terrance, you farted,"" and I fart on Terrance."
1796,21,9,President,And it's like a back and forth kind of thing? It's sort of like a-?
1797,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,"[slowly] It's like a back and forth kind of thing. I fart on him, he farts on..."
1798,21,9,President,On you. Got it!
1799,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,No! On the cow. [they both laugh]
1800,21,9,President,"Welcome to Netflix, you sons of bitches. YEAH!"
1801,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,Hooray!
1802,21,9,Craig Tucker,"Come on, Tweek. Hurry!"
1803,21,9,Stan Marsh,What's going on?
1804,21,9,Tweek Tweak,"[running by] Cartman and his girlfriend are fighting again. [Stan closes his locker door and joins the others. They get to the actual fight, where Heidi throws punches at Cartman]"
1805,21,9,Eric Cartman,Oh. Uh. Oh. Ugh! Goddamn! [he punches her once] Oh. Sweetheart!
1806,21,9,Heidi Turner,"Piece of shit! [punches him four times, he grunts as he gets hit]"
1807,21,9,Eric Cartman,"Honey, I wanna watch Terrance & Phillip with my friends!"
1808,21,9,Heidi Turner,You promised we'd have a date night! [punches him twice]
1809,21,9,Eric Cartman,"It's just one night, babe. Stan is having a viewing party, honey. [punches her once]"
1810,21,9,Heidi Turner,So then why can't I come?
1811,21,9,Eric Cartman,"Terrance & Phillip is a guys' night thing, baby."
1812,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[arrives to separate them] Uh, hey, hey, hey! What the hell are you all doing?"
1813,21,9,Wendy Testaburger,Watching Heidi get her bitch-ass kicked!
1814,21,9,Heidi Turner,"Fuck you, Wendy!"
1815,21,9,Craig Tucker,"Don't take that crap, Heidi! Let Cartman have it!"
1816,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys! Guys, this has gone on way too long. Can't we all stop being so mean to each other? [a moment of reflection around the crowd]"
1817,21,9,Heidi Turner,"Shut up, Kyle. You sound like your mom. [everyone laughs]"
1818,21,9,Eric Cartman,"Th- that was awesome, baby. I love you. [reaches out and takes her hand]"
1819,21,9,Heidi Turner,"I love you too, babe."
1820,21,9,Kids,"Awww. [disappointed, everyone disperses]"
1821,21,9,Craig Tucker,Dammit.
1822,21,9,Butters Stotch,Fight's over. Kyle ruined it. [Kyle is left all alone in the hallway]
1823,21,9,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. As you know, there's been a lot of bullying and insensitivity at our school. To counteract this, it is my firm belief that South Park Elementary is in desperate need of s a strong woman. So in looking for a new vice principal, we wanted to find a powerful, intelligent, and independent female to be a role model for us all. And with that said, I'd like to introduce our new vice principal, Strong Woman. [claps, then hands the mic to her as she walks up]"
1824,21,9,Strong Woman,"Thank you, PC Principal. Alright everyone, listen up. I'm the new vice principal of this school. My name is Strong Woman. I've already spent a few days here at the school watching and observing and we definitely have things we can all be working on. [at this point, Butters is whispering something in Clyde's ear]"
1825,21,9,PC Principal,[snatches the mic from Strong Woman's hand] Hey! Stotch! You do not disrespect Strong Woman by talking when she's talking!
1826,21,9,Strong Woman,You really think I couldn't have handled that? Myself?
1827,21,9,PC Principal,"Oh. Uh, I was just making sure everything was uh-"
1828,21,9,Strong Woman,You really had to grab the mic out of my hand like that?
1829,21,9,PC Principal,"Shit. I mean, no, sorry, sorry, I'm not u-, uh, here you go. [hands the mic back to her]"
1830,21,9,Strong Woman,"I want the girls here at this school to know that they can talk to me about anything, but I also want the boys to know what I'm looking for is a better place for everybody. [walks forward a bit] Turning this school around is going to take work from everyone."
1831,21,9,PC Principal,From everyone!
1832,21,9,Strong Woman,"[glances back at him] Sorry, am I not doing this correctly?"
1833,21,9,PC Principal,"No. NO! Sorry, I thought I'd... add, just add for emphasis."
1834,21,9,Strong Woman,You felt it wasn't strong enough? Me just saying it?
1835,21,9,PC Principal,"No-I, I'm... Uh, I'm sorry."
1836,21,9,Strong Woman,"[sighs, turns back to students] I'm looking forward to being your vice principal, and I'm looking forward to turning this school around."
1837,21,9,PC Principal,"[moves up] Alright, now if we have any q-"
1838,21,9,Strong Woman,I'm not finished!
1839,21,9,PC Principal,"[backs up] Right, right, uh, I'm sorry. Every- pay attention everybody!"
1840,21,9,Announcer 1,It's the Terrance & Phillip Sho-o-ow.
1841,21,9,Announcer 2,On Netflix. [the camera pans down to the duo. Terrance holds a pitchfork]
1842,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,"Hey Terrance, what did the black lawyer say to the Muslim priest?"
1843,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,"I don't know, Phillip. What? [Phillip climbs up a three-step ladder, turns around, and farts on Terrance. They laugh at each other. The kids watching at Stan's living room laugh at them, but Kyle looks rather disinterested. The doorbell rings]"
1844,21,9,Stan Marsh,Come in!
1845,21,9,Eric Cartman,[walks in with Heidi] Did we miss it?
1846,21,9,Stan Marsh,It's just starting.
1847,21,9,Heidi Turner,"Oh look, honey. Kyle's mom is here. Shouldn't you be at temple, Ms. Broflovski? [Kyle is shocked as the others laugh]"
1848,21,9,Canadian Mexican,[walks into view] Hola. Would you like to buy some chimichangas?
1849,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,"Si, mi amigo. [climbs onto the hay bale next to him as Phillip goes up the stepladder] Here, I'll give you two pesos. [he and Phillip take turns farting on the vendor. The kids in Stan's living room laugh]"
1850,21,9,Heidi Turner,"Dude, that's awesome."
1851,21,9,Stan Marsh,"[notices Kyle isn't laughing] What, what's wrong, dude."
1852,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,For the first time I feel kind of bad for the person being farted on.
1853,21,9,Heidi Turner,"Uf, Kyle's mom doesn't like the cartoon, guys. Better shut it off. [everyone laughs]"
1854,21,9,Eric Cartman,"Baby, I fuckin' love you so much."
1855,21,9,PC Principal,"Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you all know, we've been looking for a strong woman to take on the role of vice principal at this school. We couldn't be happier with the selection we've made and we're sure she'll be making our school a better place. So with that let me turn over the floor to our new vice principal, Strong Woman. [applause all around]"
1856,21,9,Strong Woman,"Thanks everyone. Alright, listen up. [gathers her papers up] I fully appreciate that some of you might be uncomfortable with me being here. Earlier today, I noticed that some faculty weren't sure whether to call me ""Miss Woman"" or just ""Strong."" If I were a man, you'd probably address me as Vice Principal Woman, so why should it be any different, huh? We good?"
1857,21,9,Mr Mackey,Uhm'kay.
1858,21,9,Strong Woman,"So I've been getting to know some of the students here and I'm definitely hearing a lot of frustration and confusion over issues that all the schools are facing right now. I also spent some time observing in the cafeteria and was pretty shocked by the abusive and intolerant language. [as she speaks, Hootie & The Blowfish's ""Hold My Hand"" begins to play in PC Principal's head] Not sure if any of you have noticed, but a lot of the girls are eating their lunches out on the playground to avoid being around the toxic environment that's been created. It's my intention to make the cafeteria... P.E. class is another huge problem at this school. The girls' gym outfits seem not to have been updated since the '60s. We have a lot of work to do here. I intend to do it quickly. [in PC Principal's mind, everything around her fades out and all he sees is her against a pink background with hearts everywhere, soon replaced by flowers and leaves, then a blue sky with clouds]"
1859,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Excuse me uh, I'm sorry, but uh, is anyone else hearing Hootie & The Blowfish like, very very softly?"
1860,21,9,Substitute Teacher,"Yeah, yeah, I hear it."
1861,21,9,Strong Woman,"[rises and walks towards PC Principal] It's, it's coming from over here somewhere."
1862,21,9,PC Principal,"E-excuse me everyone, I um, I need to get to the restroom. Sorry, I'll be right back. [rushes out the door, and the song disappears with him]"
1863,21,9,The Preacher,"Therefore what God hath joined together let no man [Terrance farts on the preacher] Oh! [the duo laugh. Kyle just gets off the merry-go-round and walks off campus. He walks onto a small stone bridge, where he looks at his reflection on the water below. He then leaves the bridge and goes home to look at his reflection on full-length mirror in his room. He takes off his jacket and hangs it up]"
1864,21,9,Michael Jackson,"That's it. That's it, Kyle. [Kyle takes off his Terrance & Phillip T-shirt and puts it away is his trash can, then goes to his dresser to pull out a baby blue shirt and puts it on. He then goes to the vanity mirror, takes off his hat, and gives himself a haircut] No more. No more of them doody jokes. [he leaves the bathroom and goes back to the mirror in his room] No more watching cartoons of people, people having go doody. [he checks himself out on the mirror] And poo-pooing on each other's heads. [he puts on his jacket and hat back on] It's not funny anymore, it is, Kyle? [he checks himself out once more]"
1865,21,9,Doctor,"Hello there, misterr... Principal, is it?"
1866,21,9,PC Principal,"That's right, I'm PC Principal."
1867,21,9,Doctor,Hm what's bringing you in today?
1868,21,9,PC Principal,I'm uh... having this problem with my ears. There's like a persistent kind of ahh ringing going on.
1869,21,9,Doctor,"[checking the right ear canal with a scope] O-kay, can you describe the ringing?"
1870,21,9,PC Principal,"It's um, Hootie & The Blowfish."
1871,21,9,Doctor,You're hearing a song? [walks to the other side to check out the left eat canal]
1872,21,9,PC Principal,"Yeah, uh, ahem, there's a new woman that has joined our faculty. Her name is Strong Woman, and uh, she seems to have set off some kind of device in my ears."
1873,21,9,Doctor,So maybe you're having some feelings for her.
1874,21,9,PC Principal,"No, that couldn't be it. We work in the same place, so it would be impossible for me to like her. I'm thinking there's some sort of device in my ears."
1875,21,9,Doctor,"Well, I looked, and Hootie & The Blowfish aren't in your ears. I believe you're hearing them in your mind and your heart."
1876,21,9,PC Principal,"Oh, dude. Bro."
1877,21,9,Strong Woman,You may enter. [Kyle walks in and sees her putting her books in order]
1878,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,Vice Principal Woman?
1879,21,9,Strong Woman,Yes? [sits at her desk] What can I do for you?
1880,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"My name's Kyle, and I've been doing a lot of changing lately. I came because I might be able to offer some... insight into our problem here."
1881,21,9,Strong Woman,"Please, by all means."
1882,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You see, there's a culture at this school that embraces meanness, and I believe now that it comes from a Canadian TV show. All the boys watch it. I did too. We all laughed while they... farted... on innocent people's heads. The thing is, I never felt for the person being farted on. Until now. I want to work with you to open people's eyes, because I get it now."
1883,21,9,Strong Woman,"[not following] You want to blame farts? That seems kind of ridiculous, doesn't it?"
1884,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1885,21,9,Strong Woman,"I mean, it's a slippery slope when we start pointing the finger at our own shortcomings."
1886,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"But, but I thought for sure YOU would be on my side."
1887,21,9,Strong Woman,"Kind of sounds like something my mother would say, actually."
1888,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"What?? D'oh, forget it! [turns around and walks out]"
1889,21,9,Eric Cartman,"May I have your attention please? Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Mrs. Broflovski, your tampons are available at the front desk. Thank you. [begins to laugh. The kids around Kyle begin to laugh as well]"
1890,21,9,Heidi Turner,"[over the PA system] Come on, we've gotta get out of here."
1891,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,Rrrrr!
1892,21,9,Mr Mackey,"You wanted to see me, PC Principal?"
1893,21,9,PC Principal,"Uh YES. Yes, Mackey, um, I just wanted to see how you thought it was going with Strong Woman."
1894,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Well, she seems to be acclimating fine, ukay, the kids really respect her."
1895,21,9,PC Principal,"Do you know, uh, [begins to fumble on his words] Do you know if Strong Woman has a boyfriend?"
1896,21,9,Mr Mackey,What??
1897,21,9,PC Principal,No-nothing. Just forget it. [leaves his desk and walks towards the door]
1898,21,9,Mr Mackey,Are you out of your fuckin' mind?! Askin' if a coworker is available in today's times?!
1899,21,9,PC Principal,"I just wanted to know because she's unavailable, then maybe I can get my head off of her, alright?"
1900,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Oh boy, this is bad! This is real bad!"
1901,21,9,PC Principal,[turns around] I don't know how it happened. I know it's inappropriate and yet I can't stop thinking about her. I think I'm... sick.
1902,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Look, this is real fucking fire you're dealing with, uhkay?! I'm gonna get someone down here from HR!"
1903,21,9,PC Principal,HR? Is that like... Hootie Removal?
1904,21,9,Mr Mackey,No! Human resources! The people that come in to make sure everything's kept on the level! We gotta get you back on track!
1905,21,9,Anchor Tom,"Is Canada a bad influence on the United States? A group of young people called ""Millennials Against Canada"" thinks so, and we are joined by their leader, Kyle Broflovski."
1906,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks for having me, Tom."
1907,21,9,Anchor Tom,"Young man, you say Canada is to blame for most of our problems."
1908,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,All I'm saying is that there's a culture that originates from Canada which is at least partly to blame for the state of our country now.
1909,21,9,Anchor Tom,To respond to this we're now joined by the Canadian Minister of Streaming.
1910,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Thanks for having me, buddeh."
1911,21,9,Anchor Tom,"Minister, how do you answer to these angry millennials?"
1912,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Well, they're pissed off because their country sucks, so they wanna point the finger at us."
1913,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm saying we're all guilty too. I grew up watching Terrance & Phillip, and I thought it was funny."
1914,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"So you thought it was funny, but now it's not funny?"
1915,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it was never funny. I see it differently now."
1916,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Oh, so you want to censor it."
1917,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't wanna censor it, we just wanna... get rid of it."
1918,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Uh huh, you sound like a Jewish mother."
1919,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, see? That's what I'm talking about, right there! That kind of mean, degrading, Canadian trash!"
1920,21,9,Minister of Streaming,Now I resent that! I find that racist-
1921,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,Canadians should care about the rest of the world!
1922,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"You are a racist, fwiend, and if you have a problem with Canada, maybe you should speak to your backwards President!"
1923,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe I will!
1924,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"'Kay, go ahead!"
1925,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe I know the President!
1926,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Oh, sure you do! Just like all Jewish moms, 'cause you don't understand how-"
1927,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,Stop calling me that!
1928,21,9,Minister of Streaming,Can I finish?!
1929,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,That's all you know is how to be mean-
1930,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"That's not a- Can I finish, please?!"
1931,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,Because you were all raised on it yourselves!
1932,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Please, can I finish?! [a few seconds of silence] Alright, I'm finished."
1933,21,9,PC Principal,"Alright, everyone. Listen up. As you know, we want to provide a safe work environment for all our employees. Sometimes feelings do arise and we are tempted by the Devil to act upon them. So we've been reaching out to Human Resources division as I think we can all use someone to tell us about what is and isn't considered misconduct. She has some great advice for us, so please welcome Heather Conduct. Go ahead, Miss Conduct."
1934,21,9,Miss Conduct,"Hello, everyone, my name is Miss Conduct. I'm hear to talk about making sure we avoid any trouble at this school. M'alright?"
1935,21,9,Mr Mackey,[smiles] Uh m'kay.
1936,21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright. Now, by a show of hands, who's ever had inappropriate feelings for a coworker? [Strong Woman raises her hand. PC Principal is surprised]"
1937,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,"Well hello there, little girl."
1938,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,Are you selling Girl Scout cookies?
1939,21,9,Canadian Girl Scout,Well yes I am. How about a Snickerdoodle?
1940,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,"Alright, you asked for it. [raises his right leg up high slowly and farts on the girl. The duo laugh] Oh! Oh, I think I shit my pants."
1941,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[runs into view blowing a referee whistle] Alright! That's it! Everyone stop! We're shutting it down! [the show's crew is stunned, and adult members of Millennials Against Canada come in and confiscate the equipment] We are Millennials Against Canada. We demand this kind of bullying Canadian entertainment be stopped!"
1942,21,9,Terrance and Phillip,Didn't think I'd live long enough to see this all happen again.
1943,21,9,Anchor Tom,More and more millennials are turning into Jewish mothers today as they demand the censorship of entertainment. The protesters say they're not giving up and are demanding to speak with the President of the United States.
1944,21,9,M A C Protester 1,[walks up to Kyle with a ringing cell phone] Here you go. Call is coming in on your phone.
1945,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Good. Give it here. [receives it and answers] Yes, hello? This is the leader of Millennials Against Canada."
1946,21,9,Stan Marsh,"[calling from his living room] Kyle, what the fuck are you doing? [Everyone present at the viewing party is there again, except Kyle]"
1947,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, I'm sorry I'm taking a stand and doing something. I realize this doesn't gel with your nihilism!"
1948,21,9,Stan Marsh,"Okay, dude. I didn't wanna have to say this, but you're really starting to sound like your mom."
1949,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not like my mom! I'm gonna make a difference! It's gonna feel real good!
1950,21,9,Tweek Tweak,"[runs up and takes the phone from Stan] Kyle! Kyle! Don't do this, man! You can't mess with this shit while You Know Who is in office! We're all gonna die!"
1951,21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright, so now everyone, we're gonna do some role-playing, m'alright? Talk about appropriate ways we can talk in the workplace. Can I, can I get a volunteer to role-play with me? M'alright? [looks towards Mackey] How about you, Mr. uh..."
1952,21,9,Mr Mackey,Mr. Mackey.
1953,21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright, come on up here. [he joins her] M'alright now, we're just gonna pretend it's a normal mornin' before work, and we're startin' the day. [shakes hand] Oh, Mr. Mackey. Good mornin'!"
1954,21,9,Mr Mackey,"[a bit awkward] Good morning, uh, Miss Conduct."
1955,21,9,Miss Conduct,"Now, did you have a nice night?"
1956,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, yeah it was good."
1957,21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright. Okay. Uh good luck today, and I hope that our workin' relationship can continue to be honest and straightforward."
1958,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Oh, ah I'm very open and honest, I promise you that."
1959,21,9,Miss Conduct,"I can see that. You got very honest eyes, m'alright. [turns to the rest of the faculty] M'alright, I probably shouldn't have said ""You have honest eyes"", m'alright. That's a big crossin' the line, commentin' on his physical attributes, m'alright? That's bad. I'm gonna stick to just talkin' about work only, m'alright? [back to Mr. Mackey] So, uh, Mr. Mackey, what methods do you use for counseling the students?"
1960,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Oh, I mostly use a semi-cognitive approach adapted by Kiezrick Solomon."
1961,21,9,Miss Conduct,"Wow, you studied Solomon? He was actually my thesis in college."
1962,21,9,Mr Mackey,Are you serious? Nobody I talked to has ever even heard of him!
1963,21,9,Miss Conduct,No! Same here! What made you attracted to his work?
1964,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Well it's just such a na-natural approach, m'kay?"
1965,21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright, m'alright."
1966,21,9,Mr Mackey,"When I read it, you know, first I was like ""whoa, okay!"""
1967,21,9,Miss Conduct,M'alright.
1968,21,9,Mr Mackey,"""This just really makes sense"", you know?"
1969,21,9,Miss Conduct,"[giggles] Well, m'alright."
1970,21,9,Mr Mackey,Mmmm'kay
1971,21,9,Miss Conduct,M'alright. [they smile at each other]
1972,21,9,Minister of Streaming,Mr. President! You need to do something about your millennials!
1973,21,9,President Garrison,[plucking with his eyebrows] What do you want me to do?
1974,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Terrance & Phillip are Canada's largest export! They account for 80% of our gross national product! If your citizens mess with them, they mess with all of us!"
1975,21,9,Garrison,"Look, I'm President of the United States. I can't get involved in every petty little protest against a third-world country."
1976,21,9,Minister of Streaming,"Third-world country?! [steps forward] How dare you! Canada is second-world at least! [reaches the desk] Now you listen here, Mr. Buddeh! Either you stop the embargo on The Terrance & Phillip Show, or we'll bring in our own troops to stop it ourselves!"
1977,21,9,Garrison,"Are you threatening us, you beady-eyed Canuck?"
1978,21,9,Minister of Streaming,I'm simply telling you that Canada will do what it must to protect itself!
1979,21,9,Garrison,Then I guess both our countries better be prepared.
1980,21,9,Mr Mackey,"And then, you know, I was-I was looking to get away from the city. [uncrosses his legs] I've never really been a city person."
1981,21,9,Miss Conduct,"M'alright, m'alright, I definitely get that, m'alright."
1982,21,9,Mr Mackey,"[crosses his legs again] I like hikin' around, bein' around in nature, m'kay."
1983,21,9,Miss Conduct,"No, I agree, I agree, the city's bad. I love hikin' too. What are some of your favorite places?"
1984,21,9,Mr Mackey,"Well, you know, Mt. Evens is always nice."
1985,21,9,Miss Conduct,"[chuckles] M'alright, m'alright. [they uncross their legs as a siren sounds]"
1986,21,9,Strong Woman,What the hell is that?
1987,21,9,Mr Adler,[checks his phone] There's some kind of... military alert going out.
1988,21,9,PC Principal,"[stands up and looks out the window] All right, military alert, everyone! Let's get to the hallways and get the students to the gymnasium! Come on, let's move!"
1989,21,9,M A C Protester 2,[looks out a window] It's the National Guard.
1990,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,The National Guard?
1991,21,9,M A C Protester 1,It's the President. He wants to talk to you. [hands him the phone]
1992,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. This is Millennials Against Canada.
1993,21,9,Garrison,"Yeah, listen, this thing's kind of escalating. You people need to call it quits."
1994,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"We can't do that, Mr. President. Someone has to do what's right."
1995,21,9,Garrison,What exactly do you want?
1996,21,9,Kyle Broflovski,"What do I want? I want a world... where laughter doesn't come at someone else's expense. Where people can live freely without fear of being farted on. I want a world where you aren't ridiculed for trying to help. A world where a nice girl that I liked isn't turned into another Eric Cartman! These Canadians are in the way of that world, and everything they do and everything they have done needs to be erased from the Earth!"
1997,21,9,Garrison,"Jeez, I got a little chub."
1998,21,9,Strong Woman,Let's go! Everyone to the gymnasium now!
1999,21,9,PC Principal,"You heard her! Move it, people! [more students run towards the gym. As the last of them runs by, he turns around] I have to make sure all the classes are empty. You go take cover with the kids."
2000,21,9,Strong Woman,I'm coming too. I'm your vice principal.
2001,21,9,PC Principal,"Alright, come on! [they reach the faculty room] Oh no."
2002,21,9,Strong Woman,What's wrong?
2003,21,9,PC Principal,"Vice Principal Woman, I need to ask you something."
2004,21,9,Strong Woman,Okay?
2005,21,9,PC Principal,"This is very difficult, but, uh..."
2006,21,9,Strong Woman,What? What?
2007,21,9,PC Principal,"[clears his throat] Well, as you can see, there's a door in front of us."
2008,21,9,Strong Woman,"Yes, there is."
2009,21,9,PC Principal,"I would like to open this door for you. However, I understand the gender-based biases this can imply."
2010,21,9,Strong Woman,Why do you need to open the door?
2011,21,9,PC Principal,"I don't need to open the door. I'd just be opening it and holding it the same way I would for Counselor Mackey, a student, anyone else."
2012,21,9,Strong Woman,"Somebody's gonna have to open the door, or we could die out here."
