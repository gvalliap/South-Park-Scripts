0,2,1,Announcer 1,"Since the last South Park, you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of Eric Cartman is. Now, finally, the shocking truth about Cartman's lineage... will not be seen tonight, so that we can bring you the following special presentation."
1,2,1,Announcer 2,"[Theme music plays.] Now, get ready for Canada's hottest action stars,"
2,2,1,Announcer 2,Terrance and Phillip in HBC's Movie of the Week:
3,2,1,Announcer 2,Not Without My Anus. Based on a true story.
4,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Ladies and gentlemen, the case before you today is of a murderer. On the night in question, this monster entered the home of Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer and struck him repeatedly on the head with his hammer."
5,2,1,Scott the Dick,"That monster is sitting right over there, and his name is Terrance!"
6,2,1,Phillip,"Oh, Terrance, You farted in court."
7,2,1,Terrance,"Yes, Phillip. I'm making a case for our defense. [They laugh again.]"
8,2,1,Scott the Dick,"[Approaching the displays.] All of these things link Terrance to the murder: hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt,"
9,2,1,Scott the Dick,"a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled, a haiku called, Time to Kill Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer.

""Dr. O'Dwyer
Time to have your head smashed in

with my new hammer."""
10,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not God. J'accuse, Terrance."
11,2,1,Terrance,"Would you like a monkey claw, Phillip?"
12,2,1,Phillip,"Yes, please."
13,2,1,Terrance,That's called the monkey claw because it feels like my colon is being ripped apart by a thousand monkeys.
14,2,1,Phillip,The monkey claw is smelly.
15,2,1,Judge,"[Bangs his gavels twice.] Come on, get a move on. I ain't gettin' any younger up here."
16,2,1,Phillip,"My sentiments exactly, Your Honor. I see from your actions that you're southern Canadian."
17,2,1,Judge,That is correct.
18,2,1,Phillip,"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is an innocent man. [Farts.]"
19,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip, now you farted during the closing argument."
20,2,1,Phillip,"I have, haven't I, Terrance?"
21,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Your Honor, the defense is trying to make a mockery of this court. They think that farts are funny, but they're not. [Thumps the table.]"
22,2,1,Judge,[Gavels] Sustained.
23,2,1,Phillip,"Good people of the jury. My client, Terrance, is no more a murderer than you or me. He loves puppies and hates mean things. Would a murderer go to the zoo and feed animals like this?"
24,2,1,Phillip,"Of course not. So in summation, find Terrance innocent. Or else he'll kill you."
25,2,1,Phillip,Just kidding.
26,2,1,Phillip,The defense rests.
27,2,1,Scott the Dick,Goddammit. That isn't funny.
28,2,1,Judge,"Madame Foreperson, have you reached a verdict so we can get the hell outta here?!"
29,2,1,Madame Foreperson,"We have, Your Honor. We have found Terrance, in the above entitled action of murder against Dr. Jeffrey O'Dwyer--"
30,2,1,Judge,You're gonna have to repeat that verdict because we have some flatulence issues.
31,2,1,Madame Foreperson,"I said, we find--"
32,2,1,Madame Foreperson,We find Terrance--
33,2,1,Madame Foreperson,Not guilty!
34,2,1,Phillip,"Did you hear that, Terrance? You're not guilty."
35,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip, you saved me from the gas chamber."
36,2,1,Terrance,"That sure was fun, Phillip. Let's go home and eat Kroff Dinner."
37,2,1,Phillip,Hear hear.
38,2,1,Scott the Dick,"[Coming over.] Well, looks like you got away with it, Terrance and Phillip!"
39,2,1,Phillip,"Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, right, old pal?"
40,2,1,Scott the Dick,There are hard feelings! This isn't over. I'm going ta see to it that you both pay for what you've done. And do you know why?
41,2,1,Phillip,'Cause you're a dick?
42,2,1,Scott the Dick,"No, Because I hate you. You think farting is so funny. Well it isn't!! Fart jokes are the lowest form of comedy, and if I--"
43,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Ugh! I hate you both! I've hated you ever since I could remember! I hate you, and I wish you both had cancer."
44,2,1,Phillip,Cancer?
45,2,1,Scott the Dick,Yes. In the head.
46,2,1,Terrance,Head cancer?
47,2,1,Scott the Dick,"This is not the end, Terrance and Phillip. You'll rue this day. [Leaves.]"
48,2,1,Terrance,"Wow, Scott really hates us, Phillip."
49,2,1,Phillip,"Yes, perhaps he's homophobic."
50,2,1,Terrance,"[Wondering.] But we're not gay, Phillip."
51,2,1,Phillip,We're not? [The news crews leave.]
52,2,1,Terrance,"Well, let us board the subway and return home. There we can eat Kroff Dinner."
53,2,1,Phillip,"Yes. It's been a long day, and only Kroff Dinner can calm my nerves."
54,2,1,Terrance,"Say, Phillip, why does Scott always try to convict me of murder? He does it every week."
55,2,1,Phillip,He sure does seem to hate us. I wonder what he'll try to do next.
56,2,1,Terrance,God only knows.
57,2,1,Phillip,"The subway certainly is wonderful, Terrance."
58,2,1,Terrance,It sure is. Let's look for treasure.
59,2,1,Phillip,"Yes, let's look for treasure."
60,2,1,Scott the Dick,Hello?
61,2,1,Voice,"Hello, Is this Scott, from Canada?"
62,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Yess, yes it is."
63,2,1,Voice,"You're a Journalist, right?"
64,2,1,Scott the Dick,Yes. I'm a television critic for a magazine.
65,2,1,Voice,I understand that you hate Terrance and Phillip.
66,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Yes! Yes I do! They think that fart jokes are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not!"
67,2,1,Voice,"Well, what about I help you get rid of them once and for all?"
68,2,1,Scott the Dick,Who is this?
69,2,1,Voice,"Let's just say that I'm someone who can help you, if you help me."
70,2,1,Voice,"Just call me your old pal, Saddam Hussein."
71,2,1,Scott the Dick,[Surprised.] Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi dictator?
72,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Eey, relax guy. I'm just your average Joe. Take a rest."
73,2,1,Scott the Dick,What do you want?
74,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"You want Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, I want you to bring me and my friends into Canada. That sounds like a fair trade, doesn't it? Super!.Let's get started."
75,2,1,Scott the Dick,I'm not sure I should trust you.
76,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Eeeeeeyy, relax guy! Trust me!"
77,2,1,Terrance,"Well. It's too bad we didn't find any treasure on the subway, Phillip."
78,2,1,Phillip,"Oh. Hello, Ugly Bob."
79,2,1,Ugly Bob,"Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip."
80,2,1,Terrance,"My God, you're looking hideously ugly today, Ugly Bob."
81,2,1,Ugly Bob,How can you guys say stuff like that?
82,2,1,Terrance,"Because you're God-damned ugly, Bob."
83,2,1,Ugly Bob,"I know, but--"
84,2,1,Phillip,"Ugly Bob, your face looks like somebody tried to put out a forest fire with a screwdriver."
85,2,1,Ugly Bob,"I can't help how I look. Besides, it's not what on the outside that matters, it's what's on the inside."
86,2,1,Terrance,No it isn't. [They laugh.] Wanna see what's on the inside of me?
87,2,1,Phillip,"Wait wait. I've got an idea. Why don't you put this paper bag over your head, Ugly Bob?"
88,2,1,Terrance,Yes.
89,2,1,Terrance,"If people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are."
90,2,1,Ugly Bob,"Really? Hey, thanks, you guys. Maybe now I can score with chicks."
91,2,1,Terrance,"Sure you can, Ugly Bob. If they can't see how horribly disfigured you are, they'll want to sleep with you."
92,2,1,Ugly Bob,"Thanks, you guys."
93,2,1,Phillip,Hello Barky. Hello Purry.
94,2,1,Barky,"Bark, bark."
95,2,1,Purry,"Purr, purr."
96,2,1,Phillip,"Say Terrance, I was just aboot to make some Kroff Dinner. Would you like some?"
97,2,1,Terrance,"You know I never turn down Kroff Dinner, Phillip."
98,2,1,Terrance,I'm going to put on a pirate costume.
99,2,1,Delivery Man,Special delivery for Terrance.
100,2,1,Phillip,I'll take that.
101,2,1,Delivery Man,"Sign here, and here, and here, and here, and here. [Signs all the forms.] And here. [Signs the last one.]"
102,2,1,Phillip,"Ooh, Terrannce! [The delivery man leaves.] You got a letter!"
103,2,1,Terrance,"[Now dressed as a pirate.] Shiver me timbers, Phillip. At this rate I'll never get to my Kroff Dinner. [Reads the letter.] Oh my God!"
104,2,1,Phillip,"What is it, Terrance? Did you fart?"
105,2,1,Terrance,No! It's Sally. She's being held captive in Iran.
106,2,1,Phillip,"Not Sally! Dear God, no, Terrance! Why Sally? God, why? Say, Terrance, who's Sally?"
107,2,1,Terrance,My daughter.
108,2,1,Phillip,"I never know you had a daughter, Terrance."
109,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, yes. Didn't I mention that, me hearty?"
110,2,1,Phillip,"No, you never did, Terrance."
111,2,1,Terrance,Oh. Well. It all began fifteen years ago.
112,2,1,Phillip,"My God, what a fascinating story, Terrance. Especially the part aboot Celine Dion."
113,2,1,Terrance,"Yes, indeed. [Takes off the hat.] But now my little Sally is being held captive in Iran. [Takes off the eye patch.] And I will have to go and find her."
114,2,1,Phillip,"Then I'll go with you, Terrance."
115,2,1,Terrance,"You're such a good friend, Phillip."
116,2,1,Phillip,"Well, you know what they say: A friend in need is a friend with Kroff Dinner."
117,2,1,Terrance,"Avast there, mateys."
118,2,1,Terrance,"Hello, Celine Dion."
119,2,1,Celine Dion,"Terrance, this is quite a surprise."
120,2,1,Terrance,You're looking well.
121,2,1,Celine Dion,And you.
122,2,1,Terrance,"Celine, where is our daughter, Sally?"
123,2,1,Celine Dion,"She's in the Middle East, studying anthropology. Why?"
124,2,1,Terrance,"Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and is now being held prisoner."
125,2,1,Celine Dion,What?!
126,2,1,Terrance,"Phillip and I are going to Iran to find her, but we may never return."
127,2,1,Celine Dion,"[Gasps.] Oh, Terrance. What happened to us?"
128,2,1,Terrance,"We just grew apart, Celine Dion. [He turns to leave.]"
129,2,1,Celine Dion,"Please, bring our daughter home safe, Terrance."
130,2,1,Phillip,"Hello, Ugly Bob."
131,2,1,Ugly Bob,"Hi, guys."
132,2,1,Terrance,How's the paper bag working out?
133,2,1,Ugly Bob,People seem to really like it. I even have a date this Friday.
134,2,1,Terrance,"Terrific! We need two tickets for Tehran, please."
135,2,1,Ugly Bob,Tehran is dangerous. You guys shouldn't go there!
136,2,1,Phillip,"Dammit man! [Bangs on the counter.] Danger or no, I'm going to help my friend find his daughter!!"
137,2,1,Ugly Bob,"All right, then. There's a flight leaving today."
138,2,1,Phillip,"Oh good. Well, I certainly am going to miss Canada, Terrance."
139,2,1,Terrance,"In-deed, Phillip."
140,2,1,Phillip,"Terrance, if I die whilst in Iran, please bring my body back to Canada, and bury me in a box with a side of Kroff Dinner."
141,2,1,Terrance,"Same here, Phillip!"
142,2,1,Phillip,"O Ca-nada,
Our home and native land,"
143,2,1,Terrance Phillip,"True patriot love,
In all thy sons' command,"
144,2,1,Small Group,"[Terrance, Phillip, Ugly Bob, and two others]

With glowing hearts we see thee rise,"
145,2,1,Middling Group,"[Four more...]

The True North, strong and free"
146,2,1,Larger Group,"[The folks at the kiosk join in.]

From far and wide, O Canada,
We stand on guard for thee,"
147,2,1,Crowd,God keep our land...
148,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Scott to Red Dragon, come in, Red Dragon."
149,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Go ahead, guy. This is Red Dragon."
150,2,1,Scott the Dick,The plan is working perfectly. Terrance and Phillip have taken the bait.
151,2,1,Saddam Hussein,Excellent! My buddies and I are ready to come to Canada. Has everything been arranged?
152,2,1,Scott the Dick,Yes. Everything's proceeding according to plan. Now you promised that when Terrance and Phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
153,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Hey, relax, guy. I'm gonna keep my side of the bargain."
154,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Roger, Red Dragon. Scott out."
155,2,1,Scott the Dick,"[To himself.] I've got you now, you fart-lovin' fart-lovers."
156,2,1,Terrance,I Got Ya.
157,2,1,Phillip,Burned your face.
158,2,1,Terrance,"Ow, that's rancid. hahahahaha."
159,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip. How will we ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place? We don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers, and we have no idea where to begin."
160,2,1,Phillip,"Oh, look. There she is."
161,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, good."
162,2,1,Sally,Goo. Where?
163,2,1,Terrance,"I'm here, Sally. It's your father, Terrance."
164,2,1,Terrance,I'm here to save you from your smelly Arabian captors.
165,2,1,Sally,Pa-pa.
166,2,1,Phillip,"Say, she looks a lot more like Celine Dion than you, Terrance."
167,2,1,Phillip,"Oh, now I see the resemblance!"
168,2,1,Terrance,"Well, enough of Iran, let's get home."
169,2,1,Terrance,"Well, now that I have my bastard daughter back, I feel like going to Celine Dion's house and asking her to marry me again."
170,2,1,Phillip,"Oh, raspberries, looks like I'm losing a friend."
171,2,1,Terrance,"No, you're gaining a pop vocalist."
172,2,1,Phillip,Oh my God! [Terrance looks.] What is this?!
173,2,1,Phillip,Is this Canada?
174,2,1,Terrance,It seems to have changed.
175,2,1,Phillip,This is madness!
176,2,1,Terrance,"What's going on, Phillip? How can Canada have changed so much whilst we were gone?"
177,2,1,Phillip,"I don't know, Terrance. And who is that smelly person in all these pictures?"
178,2,1,Terrance,I must take my bastard daughter back to Celine Dion and see what she has to say.
179,2,1,Terrance,"Celine, I brought our daughter Sally back, and I want to tell you that--"
180,2,1,Celine Dion,"Terrance, ha, could you come back a little later?"
181,2,1,Terrance,Why?!
182,2,1,Celine Dion,"Ah, I'm just a little busy right now."
183,2,1,Terrance,"You've got a man over, don't you, Celine Dion?"
184,2,1,Celine Dion,"Well, I..."
185,2,1,Ugly Bob,Hi guys.
186,2,1,Phillip,"Oh my God, it's Ugly Bob!!"
187,2,1,Terrance,What the hell are you doing here?!
188,2,1,Ugly Bob,I'm doing Celine Dion; what's it look like?
189,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Celine Dion, what have you done? I was going to make us a family again, but now you've slept with Ugly Bob!"
190,2,1,Celine Dion,"What do you mean? Why are you calling him ""Ugly Bob""?"
191,2,1,Phillip,"Because that's his name, you stupid bitch!"
192,2,1,Celine Dion,"You told me your name ""Handsome Bob""!"
193,2,1,Terrance,"Look at him, Celine Dion."
194,2,1,Celine Dion,Aaaaaaaaaaaagggggghhhhh!!!
195,2,1,Phillip,Behold his horrible face.
196,2,1,Celine Dion,"Oh my God, he's hideously ugly! And I am pregnant with his child!"
197,2,1,Terrance,What?! Nooooooooooooooooo!!
198,2,1,Celine Dion,I'm going to have a freak baby!!
199,2,1,Phillip,"Ohh, the humanity!!"
200,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Hey, Saddam. You helped me get rid of Terrance and Phillip, and I appreciate that, but why are framed pictures of you going up all over Canada?"
201,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Huh? Oh that? Don't worry, guy, you just need a rest."
202,2,1,Scott the Dick,...No I don't need a rest!! I want to know what this is all aboot.
203,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Hey, relax, fella. I'm just making it so that Terrance and Phillip can never come back to Canada again. I just need a couple of days, and then I'm gonna head back to Iran."
204,2,1,Scott the Dick,I thought you were from Iraq.
205,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Iran, Iraq, what the hell's the difference? Relax, guy!"
206,2,1,Terrance,"Phillip, I'm convinced that something very very not good is happening to Canada."
207,2,1,Phillip,Yes. I agree whole-fartedly.
208,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Hey, what the hell are you guys doing here?"
209,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, hello, Scott."
210,2,1,Scott the Dick,"You're not supposed to be here, you're supposed to be in Iran looking for your kidnapped--"
211,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Ah, I mean, how are you guys today?"
212,2,1,Phillip,"Wait, what were you saying?"
213,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Nothing, why?"
214,2,1,Terrance,"Hey, Scott. Guess what?"
215,2,1,Scott the Dick,What?
216,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Aargh! I hate you more than ever, Terrance and Phillip! I absolutely abhor you both!"
217,2,1,Phillip,"What are you doing, Scott?"
218,2,1,Scott the Dick,I'm wishing cancer upon you.
219,2,1,Phillip,Cancer?!
220,2,1,Scott the Dick,That's right. I'm trying to give you cancer with my mind.
221,2,1,Terrance,"Ooh, stop that!"
222,2,1,Phillip,"Hey, don't give me cancer!"
223,2,1,U S Army Official,"Mr. Hussein, the U.S. Government is becoming worried."
224,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Worried? Aboot what? Take a load off, relax."
225,2,1,U S Army Official,You seem to be... taking over Canada.
226,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Taking over Canada? Me? Eeeyy, you need a rest, fella. I'm not hiding any bombs."
227,2,1,U S Army Official,We didn't say anything about bombs.
228,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Oh. You didn't? Hey, relax."
229,2,1,U S Army Official,"We're giving you just three years to clear your forces out of Canada, and after that, we're gonna bomb all of Iran."
230,2,1,Saddam Hussein,I'm from Iraq.
231,2,1,U S Army Official,"Iran, Iraq, what's the difference?"
232,2,1,Guard on Right,"Euugh. I hate Americans. Please, let me kill them!"
233,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"No, no. You need to relax, guy. Remember the plan: first we take over Canada, then we'll have to go after the female pop vocalist. After that, we'll take over the U.S., then Europe, then China, then Newfoundland, then the world!"
234,2,1,Scott the Dick,[Returning.] What's so funny!
235,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Nothing! Relax, brother."
236,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Saddam, Terrance and Phillip are back in Canada!"
237,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Oh, really?"
238,2,1,Scott the Dick,You promised me they'd be gone for good! That was your part of the bargain!
239,2,1,Saddam Hussein,[Thumps his desk.] I changed my mind. [Thumps his desk again.] Pray that I don't change it any further.
240,2,1,Scott the Dick,This deal's getting worse all the time.
241,2,1,Phillip,"Hey, Terrance, let's watch American television."
242,2,1,Terrance,Yes. We can get satellite feed from the U.S. and watch all their stupid T.V. shows.
243,2,1,Phillip,Oh look. Here's a show. [Jerry Springer.]
244,2,1,Woman 1,...well fuck you.
245,2,1,Woman 2,Arrrggghh! [Lunges at woman 1.]
246,2,1,Springer,And this is what life would be like...
247,2,1,Terrance,It's so stupid!
248,2,1,Phillip,"Goddamn, their TV shows are lame!"
249,2,1,Mephesto,"The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is--"
250,2,1,Phillip,Look at their silly American heads.
251,2,1,Terrance,They look like groundhogs.
252,2,1,Cartman,He's my father?!
253,2,1,Anchor,"And in other news it appears that Saddam Hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the U.S. inspect his military operations. When asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement, Hussein replied, quote: ""Hey, relax, fella. You need a rest, guy."""
254,2,1,Terrance,"Hey, Phillip. Isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?"
255,2,1,Phillip,"Yes it is, Terrance. According to that newsie, he's some kind of Turkish dictator."
256,2,1,Terrance,"Well, we just can't sit here and eat Kroff Dinner and let Canada be overrun by the Turks!"
257,2,1,Phillip,"That fart sounded like a ringing phone, Terrance."
258,2,1,Terrance,"It sure did, Phillip."
259,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, wait. That is the phone."
260,2,1,Terrance,Hello?
261,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Terrance, this is Scott."
262,2,1,Terrance,"Oh. [To Phillip.] Hey, it's Scott."
263,2,1,Phillip,Tell him he's a smelly bastard.
264,2,1,Terrance,"Phillip says hello, Scott."
265,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Just shut up and listen. You've unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer."
266,2,1,Terrance,"You are such a dick, Scott."
267,2,1,Scott the Dick,You're a dick.
268,2,1,Terrance,You're a dick.
269,2,1,Scott the Dick,You're a dick.
270,2,1,Terrance,You're a dick.
271,2,1,Scott the Dick,You're a dick.
272,2,1,Terrance,You're a dick.
273,2,1,Scott the Dick,[Pause.] You're a dick.
274,2,1,Terrance,You're a dick.
275,2,1,Scott the Dick,The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair-
276,2,1,Terrance,"I'm sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?"
277,2,1,Scott the Dick,Sure.
278,2,1,Terrance,"How do you like that, Scott?!"
279,2,1,Scott the Dick,You son of a bitch! I'll get you if it's the last thin--
280,2,1,Terrance,"Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?"
281,2,1,Scott the Dick,Sure.
282,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says 'hello.'"
283,2,1,Scott the Dick,Goddammit!
284,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, wait a second, Scott."
285,2,1,Scott the Dick,Sure.
286,2,1,Scott the Dick,"I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you'll meet me at Karl's Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour. [Hangs up.]"
287,2,1,Celine Dion,"Oh, Ugly Bob, I'm so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly."
288,2,1,Ugly Bob,Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.
289,2,1,Celine Dion,We can only hope. I suppose we'll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.
290,2,1,Celine Dion,What's this?! [Gasps.]
291,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"He-yy there. I'm Saddam Hussein. I'm a big fan of Polo. I've been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion."
292,2,1,Ugly Bob,"Oh no, you don't. She's my bitch."
293,2,1,Saddam Hussein,Eh! Who are you?
294,2,1,Ugly Bob,"I'm Bob. But my friends call me ""Ugly Bob"", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim."
295,2,1,Saddam Hussein,Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.
296,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Well, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours."
297,2,1,Ugly Bob,You can?
298,2,1,Saddam Hussein,Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.
299,2,1,Celine Dion,What? Why?
300,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"Hey! Don't worry about that. Take a load off, don't worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?"
301,2,1,Ugly Bob,"Did you say, ""hostile takeover of Canada""?"
302,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"No, no, relax there, fella!"
303,2,1,Terrance,"Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he's not showing up."
304,2,1,Phillip,"Well, while we're waiting, why don't we search for treasure?"
305,2,1,Terrance,Oh. Good idea. Let's search for treasure.
306,2,1,Scott the Dick,[Arrives.] What are you idiots doing?
307,2,1,Terrance,We're looking for treasure!
308,2,1,Scott the Dick,Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can't be described?
309,2,1,Phillip,"No, we're searching for treasure."
310,2,1,Scott the Dick,Listen. I have an inside scoop. There's an Iraqi dictotor who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.
311,2,1,Terrance,Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.
312,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?"
313,2,1,Phillip,What do you mean?
314,2,1,Scott the Dick,It's your fault that he's here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! [they gasp.]
315,2,1,Phillip,"You mean, we are to blame?!"
316,2,1,Scott the Dick,"That's right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this."
317,2,1,Phillip,What is this?
318,2,1,Scott the Dick,"It's a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam's minions."
319,2,1,Terrance,That plan's scary!
320,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Well, you must do it for Canada."
321,2,1,Phillip,"For Canada, Terrance."
322,2,1,Terrance,"For Canada, Phillip."
323,2,1,Scott the Dick,"Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor."
324,2,1,Terrance,"Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada."
325,2,1,Phillip,Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.
326,2,1,Terrance,That's funny!
327,2,1,Phillip,Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.
328,2,1,Terrance,Why is that?
329,2,1,Phillip,"That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?"
330,2,1,Terrance,"Yes. Apparently, he does."
331,2,1,Phillip,Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!
332,2,1,Terrance,"Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea."
333,2,1,Phillip,"I do, Terrance."
334,2,1,Announcer,"And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money! [Not if the score is valid: 28-7.] All else aside, I must say that the Roughriders [To his right.] are simply outmatched by these Roughriders [To his left. Red and blue Roughriders go after the football and time runs out. A horn blows and the referee blows his whistle.] And that's going to take us to halftime. Be sure to stick around for the halftime show: Saddam and the Electric Iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers!"
335,2,1,Terrance,"Well, I guess it's time, old friend."
336,2,1,Phillip,Yes. Prepare the alert!
337,2,1,Saddam Hussein,Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.
338,2,1,Saddam Hussein,"You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don't worry about that, the changes will continue. I'm here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as ""New Baghdad!"" Qoloh Qalah!"
339,2,1,Saddam Hussein,You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!
340,2,1,Saddam Hussein,And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem...
341,2,1,Saddam Hussein,Or you will be stabbed in the head!
342,2,1,Celine Dion,Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht...
343,2,1,Terrance,"Now, Phlllip?"
344,2,1,Phlllip,"Now, Terrance."
345,2,1,Saddam Hussein,Hey!! What the hell is this?
346,2,1,Celine Dion,Freh kashu kaliakaliakatchut...
347,2,1,Guard,They're using chemical warfare! How could they?!
348,2,1,Terrance,"We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!"
349,2,1,Phillip,"Oh, Glorious Day!"
350,2,1,Celine Dion,"Phillip, Terrance! You've saved Canada!"
351,2,1,Terrance,"Ooh, it was all Phillip's idea."
352,2,1,Ugly Bob,"God bless you, Phillip. [Embraces him.]"
353,2,1,Phillip,"[Pulls away.] Don't touch me, Ugly Bob!"
354,2,1,Scott the Dick,"[Walking up.] Hey, What the hell happened? You were supposed to be blown up!"
355,2,1,Phillip,"We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada."
356,2,1,Scott the Dick,Oh! That is so juvenile!
357,2,1,Terrance,"Hey, Scott, you like apples?"
358,2,1,Scott the Dick,Of course!
359,2,1,Terrance,[Farts on him.] How do you like them apples? [Laughs heartily.]
360,2,1,Scott the Dick,"I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!! [Goes away.]"
361,2,1,Terrance,Oh Celine Dion. You never finished that national anthem.
362,2,1,Celine Dion,"You're right, Terrance. You're right."
363,2,1,Celine Dion,"O Canada, our home and native land,"
364,2,1,Crowd,True patriot love in all thy sons command
365,2,1,Large Crowd,"With glowing hearts we see thee rise,
the True North, strong and free,"
366,2,1,Crowd outside,"From far and wide, O Canada, we stand on guard for thee
God keep our land glorious and free
Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee"
367,2,1,Crowd,"Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee"
368,2,1,Announcer 1,"Who is Eric Cartman's father? Find out on an all new South Park, in just a few weeks."
369,2,2,Announcer 2,"Previously, on South Park: an air of sobriety fills the laboratory as the men of South Park gather to find out which one of them fathered this boy."
370,2,2,Announcer 1,"Who is Eric Cartman's father? At the end of this episode, you will know the answer."
371,2,2,Mephesto,"And now, to continue, the father is indeed someone in this room."
372,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Man, this feels like the longest minute of my life."
373,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Oooh- hey, Kenny."
374,2,2,Mephesto,"Gentlemen, the father is..."
375,2,2,Mr Garrison,"Hey, what the hell's going on?"
376,2,2,Jimbo Kern,It's a power outage!
377,2,2,Chef,Is everybody okay? That sounded like a gunshot!
378,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Oh my God, look!"
379,2,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh my God, they killed Mephesto!)"
380,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
381,2,2,Mr Garrison,Mephesto's been shot.
382,2,2,Chef,Is he ...dead?
383,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Hey! This window is shot out, too! That means the killer was not someone in this room!"
384,2,2,Mr Garrison,Then who was it?
385,2,2,Announcer 1,Who shot Mephesto? Was it the school counselor? Or was it Ms. Crabtree? Or was it--
386,2,2,Eric Cartman,Ey! Wait a minute! I didn't find out who my father was!
387,2,2,Announcer 1,Or was it Sheila Broflovski?
388,2,2,Chef,[Listening to Mephesto's chest.] Waait! [Getting up.] He's still breathin'! He's not dead.
389,2,2,Eric Cartman,[Grabbing Mephesto's shirt.] Goddammit! Who's my father?
390,2,2,Chef,[About to lift Mephesto.] We've got to get him to the hospital.
391,2,2,Eric Cartman,You've got to be kidding me!
392,2,2,Chef,"Come on, children!"
393,2,2,Eric Cartman,Eeeehh..!
394,2,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, that poor kid. It must be hell for him going through all this."
395,2,2,Jimbo Kern,There's a murderer free in South Park. We have to find out who it is before they kill again.
396,2,2,Mr Garrison,Yeah. God only knows who they'll kill next.
397,2,2,Announcer 1,Who will they kill next? Will it be Jimbo? Barbrady? The Denver Broncos?
398,2,2,Eric Cartman,Is he awake yet?
399,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,[Checking.] He's bleeding pretty bad back here.
400,2,2,Chef,Don't let him bleed on my Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel.
401,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,What's a Meredith Baxter-Birney memorial towel?
402,2,2,Chef,I actually was with Meredith Baxter-Birney in this very car. And afterwards we used that towel to... [Mad at himself.] Wait a minute. Why am I telling you this?
403,2,2,Stan Marsh,Could you pull over so I can get out?
404,2,2,Chef,What? We have to get to the hospital.
405,2,2,Stan Marsh,I have to get out first. I'm not gonna make it; I can't stand hospitals.
406,2,2,Chef,"Sorry, Stan. We just gotta drop Mephesto off and then we can get outta there, alright?"
407,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Man, it's really starting to snow."
408,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,I hope they don't close the roads.
409,2,2,Eric Cartman,They can't. Mephesto can't die.
410,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Maybe it's better you don't know who your father is, Cartman."
411,2,2,Eric Cartman,"No way, dude! I can't stand to leave things unfinished. It's like when you hear the first part of that song, ""Come Sail Away"", by Styx. If I hear the first part of that song, I have to finish it."
412,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
413,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, du-I can't do anything until it's done."
414,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,I'm sailing away...
415,2,2,Eric Cartman,No! Don't!
416,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,Set an open course for the virgin sea...
417,2,2,Eric Cartman,Eh--
418,2,2,Eric Cartman,"For I've got to be free,
Free to face the life that's ahead of me,
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard,
We'll search for tomorrow, on every shore,
And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on,
Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay Maymaynemay,
A gathering of angels appeared above my head,
They sang to us this song of hope,
And this is what they said,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads,
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me"
419,2,2,Eric Cartman,"I thought that they were angels, but to my surprise
We climbed about their starship and headed for the skies
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads"
420,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
421,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"What are we gonna do, Mayor? This killer is on the loose!"
422,2,2,Sheila Broflovski,We can't even leave our homes for fear of our children's safety.
423,2,2,Sharon,Uh... Where are our children?
424,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Officer Barbrady, let's pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town: what would he do?"
425,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hmmm... That's a good question, Mayor. Let me get right on that with thinking."
426,2,2,Man,Mayor! Mayor!
427,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,[Aside to an aide.] The press is here.
428,2,2,Sid Greenfield,My name is Sid Greenfield. I'm the director from Los Angeles for America's Most Wanted.
429,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,[Amazed.] Youuu certainly made it up here quickly.
430,2,2,Greenfield,We're desperate for stories.
431,2,2,Greenfield,A-and this one is so compelling.
432,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,[Aroused.] Really??
433,2,2,Greenfield,Sure. This story has everything. People. Furniture. Talking-ih it's a real American story.
434,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hey, I thought of something. [Close-up.] Uh... no, wait, that's subtraction."
435,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Director person, what exactly do you want to do?"
436,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Mayor, shouldn't we be focusi--"
437,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,Shh.
438,2,2,Greenfield,"We just want to do a recreation of the story for our show. Then we'll flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter. That's it. You win, we win, America wins."
439,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,Are you sure this wouldn't make our little town look dangerous?
440,2,2,Greenfield,"Don't worry, Mayor. America's Most Wanted is not about violence, it's about family."
441,2,2,Boom Mic Operator and Cameraman,It is?
442,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"[Thoughtfully.] Weelll, in that case, I guess it's okay!"
443,2,2,Greenfield,Great! We'll get started with auditions immediately. What part should we cast first?
444,2,2,Announcer 1,Who will the director cast first? Will it be Mr. Garrison? Officer Barbrady? Chef?
445,2,2,Liane Cartman,I want to have... an abortion.
446,2,2,Receptionist,"Uoh well, we can do that. This must be a very difficult time for you, Mrs..."
447,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Cartman. Yesuh- it's such a hard decision, but I just don't feel I can raise a child in this screwy world."
448,2,2,Receptionist,"Yes, Ms. Cartman. If you don't feel fit to raise a child, then abortion probably is the answer. Do you know the actual time of conception?"
449,2,2,Liane Cartman,About eight years ago.
450,2,2,Receptionist,"[Processing.] ...I sseee, so the fetus is..."
451,2,2,Liane Cartman,Eight years old.
452,2,2,Receptionist,"Ms. Cartman, uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion."
453,2,2,Liane Cartman,Really?
454,2,2,Receptionist,"Yes, this is what we would refer to as the ""fortieth trimester""."
455,2,2,Liane Cartman,But I just don't think I'm a fit mother.
456,2,2,Receptionist,"Wuh... But we prefer to abort babies a little- ...earlier on; in fact, there's a law against abortions after the second trimester."
457,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Well, I think you need to keep your laws off of my body."
458,2,2,Receptionist,"Hmmmmm. Tsk, I'm afraid I can't help you, Ms. Cartman. If you want to change the law, you'll have to speak with your congressman."
459,2,2,Liane Cartman,"[Rises from the chair.] Well, that's exactly what I intend to do. Good day!"
460,2,2,Chef,"Come on, children! We've gotta find a doctor! [Kenny follows him in.]"
461,2,2,Stan Marsh,"[Stops.] Ugh. I can't do it, dude. [Kyle and Cartman pass him.]"
462,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Stan. Hospitals aren't all that bad."
463,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, stop being a wuss!"
464,2,2,Chef,Doctor!
465,2,2,Dr Doctor,"One moment, please. Nurse, I need 20 cc's of sodium pentathol, stat!"
466,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude! She doesn't have any arms!"
467,2,2,Dr Doctor,"We're an equal-opportunity employer here, son."
468,2,2,Chef,Doctor! We've got a shot cracker outside!
469,2,2,Dr Doctor,"I'll be right with you, right after I inject this man with a long needle."
470,2,2,Stan Marsh,[Pained.] Oh man. [Grabs his stomach.] I'm gonna be sick.
471,2,2,Dr Doctor,"There there, young man. Medical science is nothing to be afraid of."
472,2,2,Stan Marsh,Oogh.
473,2,2,Nurse Goodly,"Ooooo, I think you're hitting the bone."
474,2,2,Stan Marsh,Ooooogh.
475,2,2,Dr Doctor,Yes. I can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside.
476,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Oops, he's hemorrhaging."
477,2,2,Stan Marsh,Aghh!
478,2,2,Dr Doctor,[Plop.] Ooo! His head fell off.
479,2,2,Stan Marsh,I'm gotta get outta here!
480,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,Stan!
481,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Ugh, some people just have a weak stomach."
482,2,2,Mephesto Tryout,"And the father of Eric Cartman is... Bang! Oh, Jiminy! I've been shot! [Drops the cane.]"
483,2,2,Greenfield,"Oh, thank you very much. We'll get back to you. [The actor departs.] I think I've seen enough genetic engineers. Let's move on to the auditions for the part of Mister-uhh Garrison."
484,2,2,Director's Assistant,Call the Mr. Garrison auditions!
485,2,2,Garrison 1,"Boy, I sure hope I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
486,2,2,Mr Hat 1,"[Just a sock with two purple disks for eyes.] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!"
487,2,2,Greenfield,"Alright, not bad. Let's keep him on the top pile. Next!"
488,2,2,Mr Garrison,"I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
489,2,2,Mr Hat,"You can say that again, Mr. Garrison!"
490,2,2,Greenfield,Thank you! Next!
491,2,2,Mr Garrison,[Shocked.] What?
492,2,2,Greenfield,Next!
493,2,2,Garrison 2,"[An actor with a deep voice.] I sure hope that I'm not Eric Cartman's father, Mr. Hat."
494,2,2,Mr Hat 2,"[A fist with a face drawn on it.] You can say that again, Mr. Garrison."
495,2,2,Greenfield,Perfect! You got it! Let's move on to the Chefs!
496,2,2,Liane Cartman,"...And so you see, Congressman O'Reilly, that's why I think abortion laws should be changed."
497,2,2,O Reilly,"Well, all I know is that third-trimester abortions are illegal. I don't really know anything about 40th."
498,2,2,Liane Cartman,But the person at Unplanned Parenthood said you were who I had to talk to about changing the law.
499,2,2,O Reilly,"No- No, I think youah gotta talk to the governor about that stuff."
500,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, dear."
501,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Well, this is about all I can do for him."
502,2,2,Eric Cartman,Can't you get him to talk? I have to know who my father is.
503,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Sorry, son, it might be a while."
504,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Wake up, you son of a bitch!"
505,2,2,Chef,Whoa!
506,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Now, son, that's not's gonna do him any good. I'll let you know if there's a change in his condition."
507,2,2,Eric Cartman,I can't wait anymore. What am I supposed to do?
508,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Cartman."
509,2,2,Eric Cartman,What?
510,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,I'm sailing ay...
511,2,2,Eric Cartman,"--way; Set an open course for the virgin sea
For I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me
On board I'm the captain, so climb aboard..."
512,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Okay okay, let's get outta here now!"
513,2,2,Eric Cartman,...We'll search for tomorrow on every shore...
514,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,[Looking out at the snow storm.] I don't know if that's gonna be too easy.
515,2,2,Eric Cartman,"...And I'll try, oh lord, I'll try to carry on..."
516,2,2,Dr Doctor,"My God, that's a hell of a storm."
517,2,2,Eric Cartman,"I look to the sea; Reflections--
--in the waves spark my memory..."
518,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, weak."
519,2,2,Eric Cartman,"...Some happy, some sad; I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had
We lived happily forever, so the--"
520,2,2,Greenfield,"God, I hate mountains. This better not push back our shooting schedule."
521,2,2,Greenfield,"Okay, people, let's rehearse the reenactment from the top before we shoot it."
522,2,2,Greenfield,Who's that?
523,2,2,Director's Assistant,"Oh, that's TV's Eric Roberts. We were able to get him to play the part of the little monkey guy."
524,2,2,Greenfield,"Whoa. Talk about ""all washed-up"", huh? Great to have you, Eric!"
525,2,2,Greenfield,"Here we go, aaand action."
526,2,2,Mephesto Actor,I want to announce who the father is.
527,2,2,Greenfield,Bang!!
528,2,2,Mephesto Actor,"Oh, I've been shot! [Falls over.]"
529,2,2,Barbrady Actor,Nobody move! I'm a law officer!
530,2,2,Chef Actor,"My God, I think he's gone into cardiac arrest!"
531,2,2,Mephesto Actor,[As Chef Actor speaks] Whoaw..!
532,2,2,Barbrady Actor,"You seem somewhat unnerved by this, Chef."
533,2,2,Chef Actor,"Are you accusing me, Barbrady? Because if you are accusing me, don't hide behind your clever riddles!"
534,2,2,Barbrady Actor,"Our differences must be set aside for now, Mr. Chef. I'm simply a man, a man trying to do my job."
535,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Whoa, this is a good movie!"
536,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me... lads
Come sail away, come sail away, come sail away with me-hee"
537,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Ohh. Dude, when can we get out of here?"
538,2,2,Blonde,"Doctor, I can't focus!"
539,2,2,Dr Doctor,"We're doing the best we can, ma'am. They've closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through. For now, it's just me, and Nurse Goodly."
540,2,2,Chef,Wait a second. They've closed the pass??
541,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Yes, I'm afraid we're critically understaffed. Unless we get help soon, all these people in here are completely fucked."
542,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Metaphorically speaking, that is."
543,2,2,Eric Cartman,What about Mephesto? Are you taking care of him?
544,2,2,Dr Doctor,He's on full life-support and breathing fine. He shouldn't need any help - so long as the power doesn't go out.
545,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Oof. Who didn't see that coming a mile away, huh?"
546,2,2,Voice over,"Tonight, on America's Most Wanted, a shooter is on the loose in Colorado, and its residents are up in arms! Here's your host, John Walsh."
547,2,2,John Walsh,"Good evening and welcome to America's Most Wanted. Tonight: terror invaded the small mountain community of South Park, Colorado, when Dr. Alphonse Mephesto [His picture appears.] was gunned down in his laboratory. America's Most Wanted has reconstructed this heinous crime [The South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch is seen.] in hopes that your calls could help solve the case."
548,2,2,Mephesto Actor,[Pfff. The actors flinch and he throws away the cane] I've been shot!
549,2,2,Garrison Actor,"[Catches him.] My God, Mr. Hat! Get some help!"
550,2,2,Mr Hat Actor,"Right away, Mr. Garrison."
551,2,2,Eric Roberts as Kevin,"No, no! My lifetime partner and friend, gone, taken away in the wink of an eye. O, Fortune, why do you mock me?"
552,2,2,Greenfield,What the--? Bu-eh. Eric Roberts is improvising lines again!
553,2,2,Chef Actor,I'm going to get the man to a hospital. Who will help me?
554,2,2,Eric Roberts,This is not a world I want to live in! Doesn't anyone want--
555,2,2,Greenfield,God-dammit!
556,2,2,Greenfield,What the hell is this?!
557,2,2,Boom Mic Operator and Cameraman,We've lost the feed to L.A.
558,2,2,John Walsh,"Uuuhm... We-we seem to have lost our linkup to the South Park crew, sso I guess we'll be going to our featured movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit."
559,2,2,Announcer 1,Who framed Roger Rabbit? Was it Jimbo? Mr. Garrison? Chef?
560,2,2,Greenfield,Somebody go see why we lost the hookup!
561,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Holy smokes, that blizzard is getting crazy!"
562,2,2,Nurse Goodly,"Don't panic, anybody. The power lines are down, but the backup generator is running just fine."
563,2,2,Dr Doctor,"[Opening the operating room doors wide.] Nurse, I could use some help in here!"
564,2,2,Nurse Goodly,Coming!
565,2,2,Eric Cartman,Lady-m? Is Mephesto gonna be okay?
566,2,2,Nurse Goodly,"Yes, for now. But I'm afraid the generator won't run for long. The batteries run out in half an hour. Time is very short."
567,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Nurse, please! I need another pair of hands in here!"
568,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Oh, sorry."
569,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Don't you see, Governor? I should have a right to have an abortion if I want one."
570,2,2,Governor,"[Smoking.] Mmaarr. I don't know-uh, I might need some more convincing, hm-hm-hm."
571,2,2,Liane Cartman,"I mean, what right do I have bringing another child into this overpopulated world? Then again, I should've thought of that before having sex. then againuh-- Oh, I just don't know..."
572,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Please, Mr. Chef. I've over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and Nurse Goodly."
573,2,2,Chef,What do you want me to do?
574,2,2,Dr Doctor,Do you know anything about surgery?
575,2,2,Chef,I used to watch Quincy.
576,2,2,Dr Doctor,"What?! Why the hell didn't you say so? Put on some scrubs! Boys, I'm making you all honorary doctors. You can help us save these people's lives."
577,2,2,Stan Marsh,"No way, dude!"
578,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Well, [Opens his right eye.] we're not going anywhere for a loong time."
579,2,2,Greenfield,We're snowed in?
580,2,2,Mayor McDaneils,Yes. We're trapped!
581,2,2,Mr Garrison,[Snuggling up to Greenfield.] Like sailors on a submarine.
582,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"My God, this is the worst storm I've ever seen."
583,2,2,Director's Assistant,"Oh I have to get out of here, I haven't eaten since breakfast."
584,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah, I'm gettin' hungry, too. [Rubs his belly.]"
585,2,2,Jimbo Kern,I hope you all realize what we might be facing here.
586,2,2,Jimbo Kern,Our only option might be to... eat each other to stay alive.
587,2,2,Greenfield,"Uuuhh, it's only been like, four hours. Aren't you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly?"
588,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"That's a lot of lead, Mr. Director. I don't eat pretty, but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive, so be it."
589,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Buut, how do we decide ""who""?"
590,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Well, we draw straws."
591,2,2,Greenfield,"Now, wait a minute. We all had a big breakfast: can't you people go without eating for a little while?"
592,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Calm down, soldier! We need every person here to keep his head! Barbrady, fetch some straws."
593,2,2,Greenfield,Well- who the hell made you the boss anyway?
594,2,2,Announcer 1,Who the hell made Jimbo boss? Was it Barbrady? Chef? Mr. Gar--
595,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Miles' appendix has burst. I have no choice but to operate now with our limited power. I need you all to be strong for me. [Stan raises his brows.] Nurse Goodly will take care of the anesthesia. Chef, you act as her arms. [He withdraws.] Boys, you have to help with suction and bandages. Ready?"
596,2,2,Stan Marsh,No.
597,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Okay. First, I'll make an incision on the chest, over the heart."
598,2,2,Stan Marsh,[Queasily.] Oh boy.
599,2,2,Stan Marsh,Bleech!
600,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,Duhuhude! You barfed into the incision!
601,2,2,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
602,2,2,Dr Doctor,Suction!
603,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey, who's screwing with the lights?"
604,2,2,Announcer 1,Who is screwing with the lights? Is it Barbrady? Or Jimbo? Or the 1991 Denver Broncos?
605,2,2,Eric Cartman,[To Kenny.] That is really starting to piss me off.
606,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Alright. So far, everybody has a long piece of straw. We'll keep drawing. [Draws.] Whew."
607,2,2,Mr Garrison,[Draws] Whew.
608,2,2,Officer Barbrady,Wooo!
609,2,2,Jimbo Kern,Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?
610,2,2,Officer Barbrady,The short what?
611,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you're supposed to have one of them short! That's how you decide who loses!"
612,2,2,Officer Barbrady,That's not how I played it!
613,2,2,Mr Garrison,"Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling."
614,2,2,Dr Doctor,"I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it's out and away from the hospital."
615,2,2,Chef,So how do we get to it?
616,2,2,Dr Doctor,"We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny."
617,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct."
618,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here [Points to it.] where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that's you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here."
619,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?"
620,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me."
621,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Great, then, let's do it. Go, Team!"
622,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Huh?)
623,2,2,Mr Garrison,I... can't... go on... eh. So... hungry...
624,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,We're all going to die in this horrible place. [She covers her eyes.]
625,2,2,Jimbo Kern,We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.
626,2,2,Greenfield,How can we? How could we live with ourselves?
627,2,2,Jimbo Kern,There's only one answer: eat Eric Roberts. [He's shown squatting on the floor.]
628,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"[Thoughtfully.] Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts."
629,2,2,Mr Garrison,[Madly] Eat Eric Roberts!
630,2,2,Eric Roberts,"No! No, please!"
631,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, there's no going back now. [Ned and Jimbo keep eating.] We're cannibals. [Someone burps.] God save us."
632,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!"
633,2,2,Director's Assistant,"[Coolly.] Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected."
634,2,2,Greenfield,[Miffed.] Aaww.
635,2,2,Mr Garrison,"This snow just isn't letting up. We're gonna die here, I know it."
636,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"What time is it, Barbrady?"
637,2,2,Officer Barbrady,It's almost midnight.
638,2,2,Mr Garrison,Oh! I can't... go on. [Drops to his side.]
639,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"We'll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again."
640,2,2,Greenfield,"What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?"
641,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Team B? Come in, Team B."
642,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(This is Team B.)
643,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Listen, Team B. We've found another path to the generator. There's actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don't need to walk through all that sewage."
644,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Are you fuckin' telling me that I could've fuckin' gone that way?!)
645,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left."
646,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Yup! I see it in the drift.)
647,2,2,Dr Doctor,Good. Head towards it. Team A out.
648,2,2,Eric Cartman,"What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?"
649,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,"My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive."
650,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"It is amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who."
651,2,2,Announcer 1,Who built the pyramids? Was it the Babylonians? Officer Barbrady? Samaritans?
652,2,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Okay, I've reached the generator)"
653,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Roger, Team B. [To Team A.] He's reached the backup generator. [To Kenny.] Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?"
654,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Roger.)
655,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?"
656,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Negative.)
657,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we're screwed."
658,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,D'you have any wire here?
659,2,2,Dr Doctor,There's no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!
660,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(I'll stick 'em together)
661,2,2,Dr Doctor,"No, Kenny, you can't. There must be some other way! He's going to make the connection himself, with his hands."
662,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, he'll die!"
663,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Go, Kenny!"
664,2,2,Dr Doctor,Kenny! Nnnoooooo!
665,2,2,Kenny McCormick,(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)
666,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
667,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
668,2,2,Chef,The power!
669,2,2,Dr Doctor,Quickly! Get the scanner running again!
670,2,2,Dr Doctor,We've got a chance now!
671,2,2,President Bill Clinton,"Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I'll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you."
672,2,2,Liane Cartman,"[Relieved and joyful.] Oh, thank you, thank you."
673,2,2,Bill Clinton,We'll have the pregnancy terminated immediately. [Her eyes widen.]
674,2,2,Liane Cartman,[Pulls back.] Terminated?
675,2,2,Bill Clinton,"Why yes, that's what an abortion is."
676,2,2,Liane Cartman,Oh no uh- I didn't mean that. I meant the other thing you can do-what's that other A word?
677,2,2,Bill Clinton,Adoption?
678,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Yess, that's what I mean. Adoption."
679,2,2,Bill Clinton,"Well, that's- pretty different."
680,2,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President."
681,2,2,Dr Doctor,"Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine."
682,2,2,Mephesto,[Coming to.] Where... where am I?
683,2,2,Chef,"You're at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don't know who tried to shoot you, but--"
684,2,2,Mephesto,Ohh. I'm sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.
685,2,2,Chef,Ooohhh.
686,2,2,Dr Doctor,Where's the little fat boy? He'll be delighted that Mephesto's awake.
687,2,2,Chef,He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.
688,2,2,Stan Marsh,"He was a good friend, and I'll miss him."
689,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.
690,2,2,Eric Cartman,Yeah. And now he's a freezy-pop.
691,2,2,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] Dude! D'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?"
692,2,2,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know. Let's find out.
693,2,2,Mr Garrison,Ohh. It's over! We're free!
694,2,2,Officer Barbrady,"Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?"
695,2,2,Jimbo Kern,"Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there."
696,2,2,Mayor McDaniels,But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?
697,2,2,Ned Gerblansky,"Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time."
698,2,2,Singer,"[A la Aaron Neville]
Ave Maria...

[The camera pulls back, and back...]"
699,2,2,Mr Garrison,"Well, I'm bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?"
700,2,2,Mephesto,"I'm glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--"
701,2,2,Eric Cartman,Just tell us already!
702,2,2,Mephesto,"Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that Terrance and Phillip special last month? Wasn't that just the funniest thing--"
703,2,2,Eric Cartman,[Boiling.] Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!
704,2,2,Mephesto,"Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. [All gasp.]"
705,2,2,Chef,What???
706,2,2,Liane Cartman,"[Back with her cookies.] Yes, it's true."
707,2,2,Mr Garrison,"Noo, that doesn't make sense!"
708,2,2,Mephesto,"Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. [She looks guilty.]"
709,2,2,Mr Garrison,Uh-meaning what?
710,2,2,Mephesto,Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.
711,2,2,Liane Cartman,It's true.
712,2,2,Chef,"You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, she was a he?!"
713,2,2,Mephesto,"No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis."
714,2,2,Mephesto,"The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman's DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance."
715,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Ugh. Man, this is fuckin' weak."
716,2,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude! You're a big fatass, and your mom's a hermapholite!"
717,2,2,Liane Cartman,"I'm sorry I never told you, Eric."
718,2,2,Liane Cartman,"I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you."
719,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!"
720,2,2,Mephesto,"Well, that's that. Thank you all for playing."
721,2,2,Eric Cartman,"No no, wait a minute! If... if she's my dad, then... who's my mom?!"
722,2,2,Announcer 1,Who is Eric Cartman's mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?
723,2,2,Eric Cartman,"Ooohhh, forget it!"
724,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children. Each of you gets to choose two books from the Booktastic bus."
725,2,3,Eric Cartman,[To Kyle.] Reading sucks ass.
726,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Eric, shut up! [Eric looks up.]"
727,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Boring. Boring. Gay. Boring. Boring.
728,2,3,Stan Marsh,[At the next stack.] Hey you guys. Check out these books. [They come over.] Sabrina Unchained.
729,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, these books look cool!"
730,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, there's a lot of big words in these books."
731,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(There's a lot of fuckin' vaginas and penises.)
732,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Stops by.] Hello, kids. I see you're discovering the magic of reading."
733,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Who are you?
734,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"I drive the Booktastic bus, where magic begins. You see, reading opens up whole new worlds to you. You can take a canoe down the Amazon or go back in time to Camelot or become a race car driver, all by just opening a book. Just like magic. The magic of reading."
735,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[Irritated.] God, shut up, dude."
736,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,Go ahead and pick any books you like. Then give in. Give in to the magic. [He floats away.]
737,2,3,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] If we read, are we gonna become like that guy?"
738,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, this is stupid! Books aren't magical."
739,2,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't know, I'm kinda getting a tingly feeling looking at these."
740,2,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, what's that?)"
741,2,3,Stan Marsh,I don't know. Let's go see.
742,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, being an officer of the peace means a lot of things. It's a hard job, but then I'm a hard man. A lot of people think that in a small town there isn't a lot for the law to do. Well, they're wrong."
743,2,3,Dispatcher 1,[Through intercom.] All units. All units. Report to 254 Avenue de los Mexicanos. Possible hostile situation.
744,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"There, you see? This could be a bank robbery. Or possibly even a murder! This ain't no Podunk little town!"
745,2,3,Dispatcher,"And, Barbrady, your wife called. She wants you to get some pizza on the way home."
746,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Goddammit!
747,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, people, move along. There's nothing to see here. [To the rancher.] What's the trouble? Where's the body?"
748,2,3,Rancher,"Barbrady, I just caught some guy in here having sex with one of my chickens."
749,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Uhhhh... oh.
750,2,3,Woman,"My God, that's disgusting!"
751,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude! How do you have sex with a chicken?"
752,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uhh, boys, you move along. This isn't for young eyes to see. [To the rancher.] Did you get a good look at the suspect?"
753,2,3,Rancher,"Naw, I didn't see anything. It just happened so fast."
754,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Wellll uh, this is quite interesting, huh, guys?"
755,2,3,Cameraman,"Uhh, we're gonna go grab some lunch and maybe get some shots of those turtles down at the pond."
756,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Haw, camel poo."
757,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what's this?"
758,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,It looks like a note.
759,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Give me that! [Takes the note.] That's a clue, and you'll get your stinking DNA all over it!"
760,2,3,Rancher,[Coming over.] What does it say?
761,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uhh... It says, uuh, ""Sorry I had sex with the chicken. I won't do it again. Bye-bye."" Well, there you have it. Case closed."
762,2,3,Rancher,"Dammit, Barbrady, what the hell's wrong with you? Every time somethin' happens in this town, you say ""Nothin' to see here"", and ""Case closed."" But we want justice. We have to find this sicko!"
763,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I said, return to your homes before I start arresting people."
764,2,3,Rancher,For what? Orderly conduct?
765,2,3,Officer Barbrady,How about fishing without a license?
766,2,3,Rancher,I'm not fishin'.
767,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Whataya call this then?
768,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"If you do not comply, I'll be forced to execute each and every one of you... [Pulls out his gun.] by gunshot to the head."
769,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"That's right, return to your simple lives. [Puts his gun away] Just forget this ever happened. Forget."
770,2,3,Officer Barbrady,For-get.
771,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. Barbrady sure is acting weird.
772,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wonder what's wrong."
773,2,3,Teller,Welcome to Fran's. Can I help you?
774,2,3,Teller,"Sir, can I help you?"
775,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Uhhh, just give me two cheeseburgers and some jalapeo poppers."
776,2,3,Teller,"Sure, there's just one problem."
777,2,3,Officer Barbrady,What's that?
778,2,3,Teller,We're a bank.
779,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I know that, smarty-pants! What do you think, I'm some kinda idiot?"
780,2,3,Teller,Yes.
781,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Hmmm. [Drives away.] I can't go on living this lie!
782,2,3,Anchor,"With chicken after chicken being violated, the South Park police are under increasing pressure to solve the case of the Chickenfucker. We now go live to a press conference where Officer Barbrady and the Mayor are fielding questions."
783,2,3,Reporter 1,"Officer Barbrady, what would drive a man to such a disgusting act?"
784,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, nobody can say for sure; uh, no motive has yet been established."
785,2,3,Reporter 2,Do the police have any leads?
786,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, both 3D computer modeling and intensive seismology have not given us any leads as of yet."
787,2,3,Reporter 3,But has Chickenfucker left any clues at the crime?
788,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"All right, all right! I can't read!"
789,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"There, I said it! I can't read! Are you happy now? You pushed and you pushed, and now you all know my terrible secret! I'm illegitimate! I'm not fit to be a policeman! I retire!"
790,2,3,Press Coordinator,"Okay, thank you all for coming. There's uhh, coffee and brownies out front."
791,2,3,Anchor,"And so Officer Barbrady has taken a leave of absence, and South Park would have to manage without any police force for a while--"
792,2,3,Anchor,This just in! South Park is plunged into total anarchy!
793,2,3,Anchor,"Exactly two seconds after the retirement of Officer Barbrady, looting and pillaging erupted in the quiet mountain town!"
794,2,3,Looter 1,"Whoopee, this is killer!"
795,2,3,Looter 2,"With no cops around, we can do whatever we want!"
796,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude, what's going on?"
797,2,3,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
798,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed--"
799,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, never mind."
800,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I don't believe it. All this time, Barbrady actually did keep this town peaceful."
801,2,3,Aide 1,Who knew? I always thought he was a complete idiot.
802,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,He is.
803,2,3,Reporter 3,What do you plan to do about the South Park riots?
804,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,No reason for concern. I want to assure all of you that Officer Barbrady is still our active police force.
805,2,3,Reporter 3,But he's illiterate. What do you plan to do?
806,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Uhhhhh, plan? I don't actually uh--"
807,2,3,Aide 2,"Reading classes, plain and simple. By the mayor's order, Officer Barbrady is on temporary leave of absence to learn to read, effective immediately."
808,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, that's right. It's back to school with Officer Barbrady!"
809,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, children, we have a new student joining us today. Please say 'hi' to Officer Barbrady."
810,2,3,Stan Marsh,"I can't see, dude!"
811,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay now, since our focus has been on reading, let's review some of the basics."
812,2,3,Mr Garrison,"E-yes, what is it?"
813,2,3,Officer Barbrady,I need to go poopies.
814,2,3,Mr Garrison,"[Pause.] Officer Barbrady, in school we go to the bathroom before and after class."
815,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, Christ. How do you kids do it?"
816,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, does anyone have any suggestions where we should begin with Officer Barbrady?"
817,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,How about a brain transplant?
818,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, Kyle, let's be supportive of our new student, give him the nurturing environment he needs to thrive. Now, I'm gonna write a sentence and I want us all to help Officer Barbrady read it."
819,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Give it a shot, Officer Barbrady."
820,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Ahhh... O... O--
821,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Bzzzt! Wrong! Try again, dumbass! Hahahahahahaha [Slaps his thigh.] hahahaha! [Wipes his forehead.] Okay, okay. Maybe we should try something a little easier. We can work our way up to the hard ones."
822,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Go ahead, Barbrady, don't be scared."
823,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Ahhh... O...
824,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Bzzzt drrrrr! Did you hear that, Mr. Hat?"
825,2,3,Mr Hat,"I sure did, Mr. Garrison. What a retard!"
826,2,3,Officer Barbrady,[To the children] Did you kids actually learn how to read this way?
827,2,3,Stan Marsh,"No, we just fake it to shut him up."
828,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Okayheh, okay hi'm sohry. I'm sohry heh. Let's try again."
829,2,3,Intruder,"So, what are nice chickens like you doing in a coop like this?"
830,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Now, children, I hope you all had a good time reading your books and are prepared for your book reports."
831,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Who should we have go first, Mr. Hat? Let's see..."
832,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[In falsetto.] Oh, how about Stan? Or Kyle?"
833,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Eric, why don't you go first?"
834,2,3,Eric Cartman,Oooaaagh.
835,2,3,Mr Garrison,"What's the matter, Eric? Are you not prepared again?"
836,2,3,Eric Cartman,I'm prepared!
837,2,3,Eric Cartman,"For my book report, I read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. It was very, very good. Have you read it, Mr. Garrison?"
838,2,3,Mr Garrison,"No, I can't say that I have."
839,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh, good. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, a bunch of uh, hippies, walk around and paint stuff. They eat lunch, and then they find a magical... camel... which they have to eat to stay alive. And that's pretty much it; I give it a B-minus."
840,2,3,Mr Garrison,"And I give you an F, Eric. Now sit down!"
841,2,3,Eric Cartman,God-dammit!
842,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Haa haa. Ha ha ha.
843,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Okay, Officer Barbrady, why don't you give us your book report?"
844,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I've just finished reading the heartwarming novel, Go, Dog. Go!. I found it a compelling and disturbing look at the canine psyche. If I may read a passage: ""Big... dog..., little... dog. [Turns the page.] A red dog... on a..."" Well, anyway, I'm not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life."
845,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Thank you, Officer Barbrady. That was a very good book report indeed. I'll give you an A."
846,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Hooray!
847,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Miffed.] Goody two-shoes.
848,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go
""Whoosh!"" goes the willy-wind, flowing through my toes"
849,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I think Barbrady enjoys being in school a little too much."
850,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, isn't he just supposed to be learning how to read?"
851,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Swingset, swingset, up and down I go..."
852,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Officer Barbrady, what are you doing?!"
853,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(Daaarrrggghh--)
854,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(-ooggghhh...)
855,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, my God! They've killed--"
856,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hey.)
857,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Oh, never mind. [Smiles.]"
858,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, how's the reading coming along?"
859,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"[Wringing his hands.] Oooh, pretty good."
860,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Barbrady, we really need you to speed this up. The Chickenfucker struck again last night."
861,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no!.
862,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Ah, Mayor, please, when we're around children we prefer to call him the Chickenlover."
863,2,3,Aide 2,This time he made love to Carla Weathers' prize chicken. She's catatonic.
864,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Who? Carla Weathers or the chicken?
865,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,The perpetrator left this clue at the crime scene.
866,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, I can't read this. It has silent e's."
867,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"[Throttling him.] You have to learn to read faster, Barbrady!"
868,2,3,Officer Barbrady,I'm doing the best I can. I even got a A on my book report.
869,2,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Listen, buddy! Either you learn to read quick, or else I'm gonna find a law officer to replace you forever!"
870,2,3,Aide 2,"Hey, what'd you do that for?"
871,2,3,Aide 1,"Uh, just dramatic effect, sorry. [They leave.]"
872,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh boy, I'm in big trouble."
873,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I'll never learn to read fast enough, and the town is in chaos."
874,2,3,Stan Marsh,"It's cool, dude. We'll help you."
875,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Hey, that's right. You can help me. Under article 39, section 2 of police code, I'm allowed to deputize citizens in a time of crisis."
876,2,3,Eric Cartman,Really? I wanna be a cop.
877,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"You boys will be my deputies; you can help me restore order, catch the Chickenlover, and swing me on the swingset."
878,2,3,Eric Cartman,Do I get a nightstick?
879,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Sure, nightsticks for everybody!"
880,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"You keep a tab on crime in the city, and we'll try to solve the Chickenlover case."
881,2,3,Eric Cartman,"10-4, sergeant! [Walks off.]"
882,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Now, what did that clue say again?"
883,2,3,Stan Marsh,"""If you want to know where I'll strike next, read Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft""."
884,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"To the Booktastic bus, deputies! We haven't a moment to spare!"
885,2,3,Stan Marsh,Hooray!
886,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Hooray!
887,2,3,Kenny McCormick,Hooray!
888,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Good day, friends. Welcome to the magical world of reading."
889,2,3,Officer Barbrady,We need a copy of Bumbly Wumbly and the Spotted Spacecraft right away!
890,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Oohhh, that's a very magical book, full of wondrous--"
891,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Aw, just give us the damn book, fruitcake!"
892,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,What's it say?
893,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"It says, ""Mmmuh mmmuuh..."" Uh, what's this word? [Points out to Stan.]"
894,2,3,Stan Marsh,I.
895,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, yeah. ""I... mmuh mmuh--"""
896,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Here, give me that. [Takes the book.] ""I am Bumbly Wumbly. I live in the pond."""
897,2,3,Stan Marsh,"A pond? Hey, maybe that means Stark's Pond."
898,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"That's quick thinking, deputy. Let's get to Stark's Pond immediately!"
899,2,3,Eric Cartman,Ey!
900,2,3,Randy Marsh,"Uhh, yes, Officer?"
901,2,3,Eric Cartman,I clocked you at 40 miles an hour back there. Do you know what the speed limit is heawh?
902,2,3,Randy Marsh,"Well, according to that sign right there, it's 40 miles an hour."
903,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Step out of the car, please, sir."
904,2,3,Randy Marsh,Wait a second. Aren't you Stan's little friend?
905,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[Slower.] Sir, step out of the car, please."
906,2,3,Randy Marsh,[Steps out.] Yeah. You're the one who always plugs up the toilet at our house.
907,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Ey! I am a cop, and you will respect my authoritah!"
908,2,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, right. You'd better get back to school, little boy."
909,2,3,Randy Marsh,Ow!
910,2,3,Eric Cartman,Get your ass to jail!
911,2,3,Randy Marsh,"Ow! Hey, what the hell are you doing? You can't do that! Ah-ow! Ah-ow! Ow!"
912,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Getting carried away.] Sweet.
913,2,3,Randy Marsh,Ooww!
914,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, weak, dude! We're too late!"
915,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Well, the chickens don't seem to really mind."
916,2,3,Father Maxi,"Well, this is terrible! Now, who would have sex with a chicken?"
917,2,3,Halfy,[Mischievously.] I would. [Everyone looks at him.]
918,2,3,Mr Garrison,"Aw, you couldn't screw anything, Halfy. You don't have any legs!"
919,2,3,Halfy,Oh... yeah. [He moves away on his fists.]
920,2,3,Father Maxi,"Have some respect for people's feelings, would you, Halfy?!"
921,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Come on, dudes. We need to look for another clue."
922,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Here! Here, I found one!"
923,2,3,Stan Marsh,What's it say? What's it say?
924,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"It says, ""Read Teetle the Timid Ta-- Taa-- The Taxi--"" What's this word?"
925,2,3,Stan Marsh,I dunno.
926,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"[Taking the note.] ""Ta... ta... Taaguh-- Taxi-dermist."" [Everybody cheers.] I read it! I read it all by myself! [Grins.]"
927,2,3,Halfy,"[Doing flips.] Hooray, yeah! Whoo!"
928,2,3,Dispatcher 2,Five George is en route to 496 Broad Wasteland...
929,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I've been working this beat for about three days now. You definitely have to have pretty thick skin or else these people, they just walk all over you. [The camera checks out traffic.] Sometimes you have to go undercover to get the worst of them."
930,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Winking.] Hi there, little lady."
931,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, hi there."
932,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Uh, wha-what are you doing tonight?"
933,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Well, hopefully spending some time with you, gorgeous. Is $20 enough?"
934,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Sir, step out of the car, please."
935,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Stammers.] What? Oh-oh-uh, is this a bust?"
936,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[Displays his badge.] Sir, step out of the car."
937,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Stepping out.] Hey, wait a minute. You're just a kid!"
938,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Pulls out his baton.] Maybe this'll teach you to listen to authoritah.
939,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Ow! Oo-uhow! Ow! Hey, man, what are you doing?! Ow, stop it!"
940,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Exhales.] Yeah... Sometimes upholding the law is messy. But you get by. One day at a time.
941,2,3,Looter 3,I got a TV.
942,2,3,Looter 4,Shh. Come on!
943,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"[Reading from the book.] ""Tee-tle the timid taxidermist... loves..to..."" Oh, goddamn, reading is lame!"
944,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"How's it goin', dude?"
945,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Terrible! I give up! I'm not fit to be a cop! Booohoohoohoohoo, booohoohoohoohoo."
946,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude, it's not that hard!"
947,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"It is, too!"
948,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Just read the sentence.
949,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"""Teetle the timid taxidermist loves to go to the pet-pet--"""
950,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dumbass, you can do it!"
951,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"""Pet--"" Wait a minute. [Recalls Garrison.]"
952,2,3,Mr Garrison,Conjugate the verb. Conjugate the verb.
953,2,3,Mr Hat,"Yes, conjugate the verb."
954,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Pet-ting. Petting zoo. He loved to go to the petting zoo! Boys, we're off!"
955,2,3,Dispatcher 3,"All units, all units. Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance."
956,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Sir, could you step out of the car, please?"
957,2,3,Stuart McCormick,"We're fine, officer. [Sips his beer.]"
958,2,3,Eric Cartman,"And-uhh who's, who's in here with you?"
959,2,3,Stuart McCormick,Just me and my wife and my brother. And my wife's cousin and his son and my brother's girlfriend and our two kids--
960,2,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hi, Cartman.)"
961,2,3,Stuart McCormick,"--and my brother's girlfriend's mother, and this guy Bob, who I met last year."
962,2,3,Eric Cartman,[To the camera.] Poor people tend to live in clusters.
963,2,3,Stuart McCormick,[Takes a swig of beer.] WhatWhat did you say?
964,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Nothing. Now, sir, is there some kind of a..."
965,2,3,Mrs McCormick,I want him out of my house! He ain't worth a shit! He can't even hold a fuckin' job!
966,2,3,Stuart McCormick,"Shut up, bitch!"
967,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, let's try to watch the language; there's children present heuh."
968,2,3,Mrs McCormick,You lazy-ass motherfucker!
969,2,3,Stuart McCormick,Look what she did to my fuckin' eye.
970,2,3,Mrs McCormick,I'll do it again!
971,2,3,Kevin McCormick,Mom hit Dad again!
972,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!"
973,2,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Goddammit, Cartman!)"
974,2,3,Stuart McCormick,Aagh!
975,2,3,Dispatcher 1,All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!
976,2,3,Eric Cartman,"[Stops, gasps.] Chickenlover!"
977,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody's gonna make love to this chicken any minute."
978,2,3,Stan Marsh,Maybe we were wrong about the clue.
979,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, maybe you read it wrong."
980,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, no!"
981,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Shhh!
982,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Keep your eyes peeled.
983,2,3,Stan Marsh,Look!
984,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,He's here!
985,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Grab him!
986,2,3,Eric Cartman,Dammit! Can't this thing go any faster?!
987,2,3,Stan Marsh,"[Gasps.] Oh my God, they've killed--"
988,2,3,Kenny McCormick,"[Gets up.] (Oh, it was only my jacket.)"
989,2,3,Stan Marsh,Goddammit!
990,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!"
991,2,3,Stan Marsh,"Aw, I think that's a mask, dude."
992,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Oh.
993,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude! It's the bookmobile driver!"
994,2,3,Officer Barbrady,Caught you red-handed!
995,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?"
996,2,3,Officer Barbrady,By reading Teetle the Timid Taxidermist.
997,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly! [Pleased.]
998,2,3,Stan Marsh,"What are you talking about, dude?!"
999,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn't read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!"
1000,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,So you fucked a bunch of chickens?
1001,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Yes! Yes, exactly! Don't you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate."
1002,2,3,Stan Marsh,"That doesn't... make a whole..lot of sense, dude."
1003,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!"
1004,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.
1005,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I guess I should say ""Thanks?"""
1006,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"You're welcome. And now, my reading friend, you've proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand."
1007,2,3,Eric Cartman,[Rushing up.] Freeze! Put your hands in the air!
1008,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman!
1009,2,3,Eric Cartman,I got reports that the suspect is in this area!
1010,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens."
1011,2,3,Eric Cartman,A-ha!
1012,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"Ow, that hurts!"
1013,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
1014,2,3,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
1015,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"No, no, that's not how you uphold the law! [He puts him down.]"
1016,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Well, he is not listening to my authoritah!"
1017,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oohhh, ohh, you've got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this: [Paf.]"
1018,2,3,Booktastic Bus Driver,"[Going down, squealing.] Heee--!"
1019,2,3,Officer Barbrady,You've gotta get 'em in the head; they go down quicker.
1020,2,3,Eric Cartman,Ooohhhh.
1021,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?"
1022,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Well anyway, I'm relieving you of your duties. I've proved that I can read, and now I'm back on the job!"
1023,2,3,Stan Kyle,Hooray!
1024,2,3,Stan Marsh,Hey! So what are you going to do now?
1025,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Now? [Turns around.] Well, I-ee uh... I think I'll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book."
1026,2,3,Anchor,And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.
1027,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Thank you, everybody. Thank you."
1028,2,3,Man 1,Speech! Speech!
1029,2,3,Officer Barbrady,[Lowers his arms.] What?
1030,2,3,Stan Marsh,"They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days."
1031,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I'd like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious."
1032,2,3,Man 2,"Oh, yeah!"
1033,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Second, I'd like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered! [More cheering.] And finally, I'd like to say that [Enunciating.] reading totally sucks ass!"
1034,2,3,Stan Kyle,Hooray!
1035,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: Atlas Shrugged, by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I'm never reading again!"
1036,2,3,Stan Marsh,Hooray for Barbrady!
1037,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Hooray for Barbrady!
1038,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! I guess reading really does suck ass!
1039,2,3,Eric Cartman,"Ey, that's what I've been saying all along, you guys."
1040,2,3,Stan Marsh,"I'm just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back."
1041,2,3,Kyle Broflovski,It's poetic justice.
1042,2,3,Officer Barbrady,"[Leaning forward.] Thanks, boys."
1043,2,3,Kenny McCormick,(Ow!)
1044,2,4,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. This morning we're going to have a special lecture by your school counselor, Mr. Mackey."
1045,2,4,Stan Marsh,[Imitating the counselor] Booooo!
1046,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Nuh-now, who was that?"
1047,2,4,Mr Mackey,"That is not appropriate behavior, m'kay?"
1048,2,4,Stan Marsh,"[Mimicking] I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
1049,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh... That's okay, just don't let it happen again."
1050,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Following Stan's lead.] We won't let it happen again, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
1051,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh, okay, okay, that's fine."
1052,2,4,Eric Cartman,M'kay?
1053,2,4,Mr Mackey,"M'kay. [More laughs.] Now, uh, as your counselor, I'm here to tell you about drugs and alcohol and why they're bad, m'kay? Uh, so, first of all, uh, smokin's bad."
1054,2,4,Mr Mackey,"You shouldn't smoke. And-uh, alcohol is bad."
1055,2,4,Mr Mackey,"You shouldn't drink alcohol. And-uh, as for drugs, well, drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. M'kay, that about wraps up my introduction, now uh, are there any questions?"
1056,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Yes, Stan?"
1057,2,4,Stan Marsh,Why do dogs have cold noses?
1058,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uhhh, well, I'm not sure."
1059,2,4,Stan Marsh,Oh.
1060,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Now-uh, let's focus our discussion first on marijawana."
1061,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Marijawana's bad, and it also has a very distinct smell, okay? I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit. Now, I want you all to take a smell,"
1062,2,4,Mr Mackey,"...so you know when someone is smoking marijawana near you. M'kay, just take a smell, pass it on,"
1063,2,4,Mr Mackey,"...and when it gets back up to me,"
1064,2,4,Mr Mackey,"...we'll finish talking about it. In the meantime, I want to get into alcohol a little, okay? Uh, alcohol is bad. Uh, if you drink alcohol you..."
1065,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, are you guys gonna come to Ike's party this weekend?"
1066,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Your little brother's having a party? Why, is it his birthday?"
1067,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's his bris."
1068,2,4,Eric Cartman,"What the hell is a ""bris""?"
1069,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. But there's gonna be lots of food, and a band."
1070,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, kick ass! I wanna have a bris!"
1071,2,4,Mr Mackey,"...and so uh, that's why alcohol is bad. Uh, ha-has that marijawana made it back up here yet?"
1072,2,4,Mr Mackey,No? O-okay. Let's talk about LSD.
1073,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh, children, LSD i-is bad. It's a drug made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney..."
1074,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Hey, are we supposed to get your little brother presents for a bris?"
1075,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Uhhh... I'm not sure.
1076,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Well, dude, you better find out!"
1077,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Boys, are you paying attention?"
1078,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Sorry, Mr. Mackey, m'kay?"
1079,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Okay. Now, children, has that marijawana made it around yet?"
1080,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uhh, who-who has the marijawana now?"
1081,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Ummm okay, whoe-whoever has the marijawana, just pass it up to the front row, m'kay?"
1082,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uh-oh.
1083,2,4,Principal Victoria,"I am very disappointed in you, young man. You should be ashamed of yourself. What could have possessed you to be so stupid? [Thumps the desk.]"
1084,2,4,Mr Mackey,"I'm sorry, Prinshipal Victoria."
1085,2,4,Principal Victoria,"We-hell, ""sorry"" isn't going to cut the cheese this time, mister! I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you from school."
1086,2,4,Mr Mackey,You mean I'm fired?
1087,2,4,Principal Victoria,"Well, I guess that's the grown-up way to put it, yes."
1088,2,4,Mr Mackey,"But-but it was an honest error of judgment, m'kay? I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--"
1089,2,4,Principal Victoria,"It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but I'm afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty."
1090,2,4,Mr Mackey,But--
1091,2,4,Principal Victoria,"We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of you!"
1092,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-[Sniff.]m'kay? Wha-what will I do for money??"
1093,2,4,Principal Victoria,"There, there, now. Maybe this will all blow over someday and we can give you a job as a janitor cleaning up vomit with that pink sawdust stuff."
1094,2,4,Mr Mackey,[Sobbing.] No-uho-uho-uho! [Sniff.] Not o-uho-uhokay!
1095,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Man! That sucked, getting searched."
1096,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, my ass is killing me."
1097,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Why did they search us? That marijawana never even made it to us.
1098,2,4,Eric Cartman,I wonder who took it.
1099,2,4,Announcer,And now it's almost time for BoBo's.
1100,2,4,Chef,"Hello there, children."
1101,2,4,Boys,"Hey, Chef."
1102,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,How's it going?
1103,2,4,Chef,Bad.
1104,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Why bad?
1105,2,4,Chef,"Children, I heard about what happened at school today. Now, none of you took that nasty marijuana, did you?"
1106,2,4,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, we never even saw it!"
1107,2,4,Chef,Okay. Because I just want to tell you that drugs are bad!
1108,2,4,Stan Marsh,"We know, we know, that's what everybody says."
1109,2,4,Chef,Right. But do you know why they're bad?
1110,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Because they're an addictive solution to a greater problem, causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits."
1111,2,4,Chef,And do you have any idea what that means?
1112,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,No.
1113,2,4,Eric Cartman,"I know. Drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck."
1114,2,4,Chef,"Look, children. This is all I'm goin' to say about drugs: stay away from them. There's a time and place for everything, and it's called college. Do you understand?"
1115,2,4,Boys,Dude!
1116,2,4,Chef,Okay. [Starts to move.]
1117,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, are you going to come to Ike's bris this weekend?"
1118,2,4,Chef,"[Stops.] Oh, hell no! I can't bear to see that!"
1119,2,4,Stan Marsh,What do ya mean?
1120,2,4,Chef,Don't you boys know what a bris is? They're going to circumcise him.
1121,2,4,Eric Cartman,Wo-what's that?
1122,2,4,Chef,Oh boy. Here we go again.
1123,2,4,Chef,Children... Uhh... What's the one thing that's more sacred to a man than anything else in the world?
1124,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Ahhh, bicycles?"
1125,2,4,Eric Cartman,Ham?
1126,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No, not ham, you fat fuck!"
1127,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Screw you! It's ham, isn't it?"
1128,2,4,Chef,"No, no, no, children, I'm talkin' about the most important part of a man's body."
1129,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Your heart?
1130,2,4,Stan Marsh,Your eyes?
1131,2,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Ooh, the penis!)"
1132,2,4,Chef,That's right.
1133,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey! My mom says you're not supposed to call it a penis, Kenny! You're supposed to call it a fireman."
1134,2,4,Chef,"A ""fireman""?"
1135,2,4,Eric Cartman,"That's the proper way to say it, or else you get a spanking."
1136,2,4,Chef,"Dammit, children! Why do I always have to be the one to explain all this stuff to you?"
1137,2,4,Chef,Ask your parents for once!
1138,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, wait!"
1139,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, something tells me this bris thing isn't good."
1140,2,4,Female passenger,"Hey, Mackey, you got any more pot? My four-year-old needs a fix! Yehahahahaha!"
1141,2,4,Mr Allen,"Hey, Mackey! Now we see what you and Homer Simpson have in common, d'oh-pe! [Peels away.] Ha ha ha ha!"
1142,2,4,Driver 2,"Heeey, Mackey!"
1143,2,4,Driver 3,"Hey, Mackey! Why did the drug user cross the road?"
1144,2,4,Driver 3 s Passenger,"Who do you think you are, you stupid drug-taking hippie?! You damn hippies are all alike!"
1145,2,4,Driver 4,Won't you leave the guy alone?
1146,2,4,Driver 5,"Hey, hippie, are you gonna do some drugs?"
1147,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uuuuuugh!
1148,2,4,Bartender,"Hey, I don't think I've seen you around here before."
1149,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Naw, I just-- I had to get away, m-m'kay? I just lost my job."
1150,2,4,Bartender,"Oh that's weak, man. You know what you need? You need a good, stiff drink."
1151,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Oh-uh-uh, I don't drink, m'kay?"
1152,2,4,Bartender,"Trust me, man! It'll make you feel better."
1153,2,4,Mr Mackey,Ughuh... [To himself.] Drinkin's bad.

 Devil Mackey
 Angel Mackey","[Poof.] Yeah, why the hell not? It's just a beer. Don't be such a pussy, m'kay?"
1156,2,4,Bartender,So how do you feel?
1157,2,4,Mr Mackey,"[Burp] Woah, about the same."
1158,2,4,Bartender,"Oh, you just need something a little stronger."
1159,2,4,Stan Marsh,[Rushing up.] Kyle! You have to stop them!
1160,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Stop who?
1161,2,4,Stan Marsh,Dude! I found out what a bris is! I found out what they're gonna do to Ike!
1162,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1163,2,4,Stan Marsh,They're gonna chop off his wee wee!
1164,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Chop off his wee wee?! Are you sure?!
1165,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude! It's a Jewish tradition! It's called a circumstision!"
1166,2,4,Eric Cartman,Dude! That is not cool! Choppin' off wee wees is not cool!
1167,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,That can't be true! My parents wouldn't do that!
1168,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I asked five different people. They said all Jewish boys have circumstisions, an-and they make it into a party called a bris."
1169,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Dude, yuh-eh-you just don't...chop off somebody's fireman!"
1170,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I won't believe it! I won't! I have to ask my mom and dad!
1171,2,4,Mr Mackey,"We are young, m'kay?
Heartache to heartache we stand, m'kay?
No promises, no demands, m-m'kay..?"
1172,2,4,Mr Mackey,Whoa... Is this my house?
1173,2,4,Landlord,"[Smoking a cigar.] Your key ain't gonna work, Mackey! I changed the locks!"
1174,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Why, Mr. Freely?"
1175,2,4,Mr Freely,I'm not rentin' to you anymore! I heard that you got fired from your job for selling drugs to children!
1176,2,4,Mr Mackey,"No, no, no, m'kay? I-it wasn't like that."
1177,2,4,Mr Freely,"Drugs are an illegal narcotic! And having never taken drugs, I can say that they have nothing to offer!"
1178,2,4,Mr Mackey,But I've never taken drugs either.
1179,2,4,Mr Freely,"I've never taken drugs, and look at me! I'm totally fine! Now get off my property before I lose control and kill you!"
1180,2,4,Mr Mackey,Huuhh?
1181,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Ow, m'kay?!"
1182,2,4,Mr Freely,Drug user! Druuug user!

1189,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,Your mother's made gahekgafuga.
1190,2,4,Eric Cartman,What the hell is gahekgafuga?
1191,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad, what exactly are this party for?"
1192,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,To celebrate your little brother's [Ike claps.] passage into life.
1193,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Meaning what?
1194,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,Meaning we're going to circumcise him. [Kyle gasps.]
1195,2,4,Eric Cartman,They are gonna cut off his fireman!
1196,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"It's Jewish tradition, bubbe."
1197,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Normally, we do it right after the baby is born, but we had to do it later for Ike because he's a--"
1198,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!
1199,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, now what's gotten into him? Stan, will you go talk to him?"

1206,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I can't believe my parents are cannibals!
1207,2,4,Stan Marsh,"What are you goin' to do, dude?"
1208,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I have to save my little brother! I have to send him away until my parents come to their senses!
1209,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Ike!"
1210,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Cover me for a while. I'll find a place to hide him and come back.
1211,2,4,Eric Cartman,"No way, dude! We're not staying alone in your house with your wee-wee-choppin' parents!"
1212,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Just give me 30 minutes. Come on, Ike!"
1213,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Hoh! I can't sleep; it's too cold, m'kay?"
1214,2,4,Hobo,"Hey, you want somethin' to warm you up?"
1215,2,4,Mr Mackey,"[Startled.] Oh, I didn't know this dark alley was taken."
1216,2,4,Hobo,"[Holds out a joint.] Here, try this; it'll warm you up."
1217,2,4,Mr Mackey,Marijuwana's bad.
1218,2,4,Hobo,What?
1219,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Ma-marijuwana makes you feel depressed and low, m'kay?"

1225,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Man, this alley is cool! It's so alive and beautiful! [He drops the joint.]"
1226,2,4,Hobo,"Ohh, boy."
1227,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Ike, hurry up! [Ike babbles.] Where is the next train going?"
1228,2,4,Train Station Clerk,"Lincoln, Nebraska; train leaves in five minutes."
1229,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You wanna go to Nebraska, Ike?"
1230,2,4,Ike Broflovski,No!
1231,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I need one ticket for my little brother.
1232,2,4,Train Station Clerk,That's a little brother? I thought it was a trash can or something. What's wrong with his head?
1233,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
1234,2,4,Train Station Clerk,"I'm sorry, but we just can't throw Caucasian babies on an outbound train."
1235,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,But my parents are gonna cut off his ding-dong!
1236,2,4,Train Station Clerk,What?! Why the hell would they do that?
1237,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"They've just gone crazy for a while. Please, mister, I have to hide my brother until they come to their senses."
1238,2,4,Train Station Clerk,"No can do, sonny."
1239,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dammit!
1240,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, if you wanna keep your penis, you have to get on this train."
1241,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ready, Ike? Kick the baby!"
1242,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Don't kick the--
1243,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Goodbye, Ike! Be safe! I'll come find you in Nebraska when Mom and Dad are back to normal!"
1244,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Bye-bye.
1245,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Oh, man, where am I?"
1246,2,4,Teen 1,"Hey, wow, it's that counselor from elementary school, Mr. Mackey."
1247,2,4,Teen 2,"Wow, dude."
1248,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh, hi, boys, how are you today?"
1249,2,4,Teen 1,"Pretty good, man. How are you?"
1250,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Oh, I've been better. I've been kicked out of town for doing drugs."
1251,2,4,Teen 1,"Hey! Us, too!"
1252,2,4,Teen 2,"Yeah, remember? You caught us smoking weed in the bathroom and got us suspended."
1253,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Oh. O Fortune, how you mock me?"
1254,2,4,Teen 1,"Oh, cheer up, bro; all you need is some clear liquid to get your head straight."
1255,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Uh-uh, boys, LSD is bad. Hmmm..."
1256,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Man, who put all this cotton in my mouth?"
1257,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, baby... The world is so small."
1258,2,4,Mr Mackey,I'm free... I'm free...
1259,2,4,Teen 2,"Sweet dude, totally killer."
1260,2,4,Teen 1,That guy's totally trippin'.
1261,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"There, what do you think?"
1262,2,4,Eric Cartman,What the hell is that supposed to be?
1263,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm making a dummy Ike doll. My parents think he's out with me right now, and I have to bring him back for dinner."
1264,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I think you mom's gonna notice that isn't Ike."
1265,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,Not when  if I say he's sick and put him to bed right away.
1266,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No, go away! Bad dog!"
1267,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what did you make that doll out of?"
1268,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,I used a bunch of bones from the butcher shop.
1269,2,4,Eric Cartman,Is that why it stinks so bad?
1270,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Hi, boys."
1271,2,4,Boys,"Hi, Mr. Mackey."
1272,2,4,Mr Mackey,Are you boys stayin' out of trouble?
1273,2,4,Boys,Yes.
1274,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Okay, I-I'm just gonna go over here for a while."
1275,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone."
1276,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Knock it off, asshole!"
1277,2,4,Eric Cartman,No way! I'm never going back to your parents' house!
1278,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude. If it were your little brother, we'd help you."

1285,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Bubbe, where have you been? Dinner's been ready for five minutes."
1286,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Sorry, Mom. I just had to deal with Ike. He-he's been cranky."
1287,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,How is my little jellybean?
1288,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Doing Ike.] Bye-bye seeme mama. [As himself.] Ah, I'm gonna take him up to the bathroom to get washed up."
1289,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Okay, but first let Mommy give you a kiss."

1305,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, wait a minute. How come Ike's tombstone has the Canadian flag on it?"
1306,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, bubbe, there's something you have to know. Ike wasn't really your brother, he was adopted."
1307,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,What??
1308,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"He was not really a Broflovski, he was Canadian. But we loved him all the same. [He starts to sob]"
1309,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You mean to tell me that all this time I've been trying to protect Ike from having his fireman cut off, and he's not even my real brother?!"
1310,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,What are you talking about?
1311,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, Ike isn't dead. He's in Nebraska!"
1312,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,What-what-whaaat?!
1313,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you shouldn't have told them that. Now they're gonna find him and cut off his penis!"
1314,2,4,Eric Cartman,Fireman!
1315,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ooh, who the hell cares? He's not even my responsibility."

1335,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"If we don't find him, so help me, you're gonna be grounded for a month!"
1336,2,4,Shiela,"Ike, love?"
1337,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Grousing.] All the time: ""Look out for your little brother, Kyle!"", ""Take care of your little brother, Kyle"", and he wasn't even really my little brother."
1338,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,"Kyle, just because Ike is adopted doesn't make him any less your brother."
1339,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, right."
1340,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Excuse me, we're looking for a two-year-old Canadian boy."

1350,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"But first, apologize to your brother!"
1351,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,[Pointing at Ike.] He's not my brother!
1352,2,4,Gerald Broflovski,Apologize to him!
1353,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Angrily.] I'm sorry, Ike."
1354,2,4,Ike Broflovski,"Uh oh, stufid."
1355,2,4,Blonde,"Wooow, this is sooo beautiful!"
1356,2,4,"Mr. Mackey
 Devil Mackey
 Angel Mackey",[A dove alights on his right arm.] I am one with the animals. And the trees.
1357,2,4,Blonde,And I am one with you. [They reach for each other.]
1358,2,4,Mr Mackey,"At long last I have found
A true reason to be
Now I feel I can start anew--"
1359,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Woo, whoa! Ow! Hey!"
1360,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uh oh hel-m. Hey!
1361,2,4,Blonde,[Subdued.] Whoa...
1362,2,4,"Mr. Mackey
 Devil Mackey
 Angel Mackey","[As Mr. T tosses him into the A-Team van.] Yeah I got, m'kay?"
1363,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uh-- What the hell is going on?!
1364,2,4,Jimbo Kern,"Tough love, Mr. Mackey. We're taking you to rehab."
1365,2,4,Mr Mackey,I don't want to go to rehab! I haven't even done drugs in weeks!
1366,2,4,Principal Victoria,"We were wrong for shunning you, Mr. Mackey, and we apologize. We should have realized that you needed help."
1367,2,4,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, and now we're gonna make sure you get the help you need."
1368,2,4,Mr Mackey,I don't want help!
1369,2,4,Principal Victoria,You'll thank us later.
1370,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Hello, Tom. Hello, Patty. Thanks for coming to Ike's bris."
1371,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Uh oh.
1372,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Look Ike, It's Uncle Murray!"
1373,2,4,Uncle Murray,"Hello, Ike! Say, where's little Kyle?"
1374,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"He's been sent to his room for being a bastard. He's decided that Ike isn't his brother, since he's adopted."
1375,2,4,Guest,Hi there!
1376,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,Hello. Do I know you?
1377,2,4,Guest,"Uh-no, but I never miss a bris. Here, I brought some dip. [Gives it to her.]"
1378,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Ohhh, thanks."
1379,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess the chopping is about to commence."
1380,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Oh deh family nrr.
1381,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,What do you want?!
1382,2,4,Ike Broflovski,I wumuh trecompr. Com. Tebruhnerr.
1383,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ohhh, no you don't. That isn't gonna work on me, Canadian!"
1384,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Maybe you're being too hard on him, dude."
1385,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,No way! There's no real connection between us. It was all a big lie.
1386,2,4,Ike Broflovski,"Cookie Monster, [flips some pages] two, three, four, five."
1387,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Go on, Canadian! Beat it! I'm through getting in trouble for you!"
1388,2,4,Ike Broflovski,[Now sporting one of Kyle's caps.] Baraterndr nfard fy. [Kyle looks. Pause.]
1389,2,4,Social Worker,You have to admit you have a problem before anyone can help you.
1390,2,4,Mr Mackey,But I don't think I really have a problem.
1391,2,4,Social Worker,Nonsense! You did drugs! I suppose you forgot all about your family.
1392,2,4,Mr Mackey,I don't really have a family.
1393,2,4,Social Worker,And you lost your job.
1394,2,4,Mr Mackey,"No, I lost my job before that."
1395,2,4,Social Worker,"Mr. Mackey, you're supposed to be an adult."
1396,2,4,Social Worker,"The problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them. There's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Mackey, and it's called college! Now, I want you to repeat after me: Drugs are bad."
1397,2,4,Mr Mackey,Drugs are baad.
1398,2,4,Social Worker,Drugs are bad.
1399,2,4,Mr Mackey,Uhh... Dru-drugs are baad.
1400,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"Hello, Dr. Schwartz! Thank you so much for coming all this way to perform Ike's bris."
1401,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"Oh, my pleasure, Sheila. I brought the normal cutting device, but then I remembered that Ike was Canadian, so I brought the right one."
1402,2,4,Where is the little rug rat,Dialog
1403,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,Right over here.
1404,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"Come 'ere, you."
1405,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Oowwww!
1406,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Oh deh faminrr.
1407,2,4,Dr Schwartz,Ike? Ike?
1408,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Heh cohcoh mondefern menurr.
1409,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"There you are. Come on Ike, it's time."
1410,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,You stay away from my little brother!
1411,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"[Stammers.] Bu-bu-but, son, I just--"
1412,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You aren't gonna cut off his wee wee. Not today, you sick-ass weirdo!"
1413,2,4,Sheila Broflovski,"[Now in the room.] Kyle, what are you talking about?"
1414,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,And you! You should be ashamed of yourself! Don't you understand that us males are defined by our firemen?!
1415,2,4,Eric Cartman,"[A bit solemnly.] Yes. The fireman is very magical. If you rub his helmet, he spits in your eye. [Stan draws a blank.]"
1416,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"Kyle... a-a circumcision is a very common thing for Ike to have. His father had it, his grandfather had it, and..."
1417,2,4,Dr Schwartsz,...his brother had it.
1418,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No! No, it isn't true!"
1419,2,4,Dr Schwartz,"We're not going to cut it off! We're just goin' to snip it, so it looks bigger."
1420,2,4,Stan and Cartman wonder,Dialog
1421,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hey, that doesn't sound like a bad idea!"
1422,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Heyeah, I want to get a circumstision, too. [Kyle looks up.]"
1423,2,4,Social Worker,"Congratulations, Mr. Mackey. You are fully recovered."
1424,2,4,Mr Mackey,"I can't thank you enough for everything, m'kay? I feel like my old self again."
1425,2,4,Social Worker,Just one more thing.
1426,2,4,Social Worker,Remember that you can stay sober.
1427,2,4,Mr Mackey,"I will, Ms. Social Worker. I will. [They embrace one last time.] M'kay?"
1428,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"It's okay, Ike. I'm here."
1429,2,4,Dr Schwartz,And-a one and-a two and-a... bris. [Snip.]
1430,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Ouch. Amuhbuhbuhbuh.
1431,2,4,Ike Broflovski,Cookie Monster.
1432,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[Gets up.] Ike, you're okay. [Cartman and Stan get up.]"
1433,2,4,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude, I guess having a bris isn't all that bad."
1434,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. You know, I've learned something today. Family isn't about whose blood you have, it's about who you care about."
1435,2,4,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
1436,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,And that's why I feel like you guys are more than just friends. You're my family. [Tugs on Ike and moves away.] Except for Cartman.
1437,2,4,Stan Marsh,[Follows.] Naturally.
1438,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Eah, screw you guys! I don't wanna be in your penis-choppin' family anyway!"
1439,2,4,Mr Garrison,"And so now, children, your school counselor is back, to tell you firsthand about his nasty experience with drugs and alcohol."
1440,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Okay, kids? Uh, you shouldn't do drugs, m'kay? Drugs are bad. You see, I was at the bottom of the barrel. I was a wreck; why, I didn't even care about money. I was-I was wasting my life..."
1441,2,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys wanna come to my bris tomorrow?"
1442,2,4,Stan Marsh,"You can't have your bris tomorrow, Cartman, that's when I'm having mine."
1443,2,4,Eric Cartman,"No way, I set up mine first, hippie!"
1444,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Now boys, you need to listen up, m'kay? Wha-what I'm talkin' about might save your life someday, m'kay?"
1445,2,4,Stan Marsh,"[Mimicking.] Okay, Mr. Mackey, okay?"
1446,2,4,Mr Mackey,M'kay.
1447,2,4,Kyle Broflovski,M'kay?
1448,2,4,Mr Mackey,M'kay.
1449,2,4,Eric Cartman,Okay?
1450,2,4,Mr Mackey,Okay.
1451,2,4,Mr Mackey,"Now, as I was sayin, uh... drugs are bad. You shouldn't do drugs. Eh, uh if you do them, you're bad. Because drugs are bad, m'kay? It's a bad thing to do drugs. So-uh so don't be bad, by doing drugs, unkay? That'd be bad, 'cause drugs are bad. M'kay?"
1452,2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, it's Friday, and you know what that means for PE class. We're gonna play dodgeball!"
1453,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,We don't wanna play dodgeball. It hurts.
1454,2,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
1455,2,5,Chef,So let's have half the children on this side [To his right.] and half the children on that side. [To his left]
1456,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"[Uncertain.] Uhh... Excuse me a moment, gentlemen. I don't believe I know how to play dodgeball."
1457,2,5,Eric Cartman,[With Clyde and Stan looking on.] What? Don't you have dodgeball in France?
1458,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Well, no. And actually, I'm not from France--"
1459,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Look, Pip, the rules are simple. A kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball."
1460,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, dear."
1461,2,5,Stan Marsh,"If the ball hits you, you're out, but if you catch the ball, he's out, and the last team to still have anybody standing wins."
1462,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, what jolly good fun!"
1463,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"No it isn't, it hurts! I can't believe they let us play this in school."
1464,2,5,Chef,[Blows his whistle.] Play ball!
1465,2,5,Clyde Donovan,Ow! Ahow-ow-ooooowww!
1466,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Dammit, we lost one already!"
1467,2,5,Chef,"Aheeheh, you're out, Clyde! Heheheh."
1468,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Jordan, Swanson, pull forward! We need backup."
1469,2,5,Stan Marsh,We're losing men fast out here!
1470,2,5,Chef,[Giggling.] Concentrate on your ge-hame! Be the buhaw-hall!
1471,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,I caught it! I caught it!
1472,2,5,Chef,"Great catch, Kyle! Now your team's on offense!"
1473,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Here, Pip, you throw."
1474,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Ugh... Oh, no, I couldn't."
1475,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, limey, don't be a wuss! Are you just gonna be a little French pig your whole life?"
1476,2,5,Pip Pirrip,I'm not French--
1477,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Throw the ball, you stupid frog!"
1478,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"God-damn, maybe if you didn't eat all those croissants,"
1479,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,you'd be able to-- Ow! [He falls.].
1480,2,5,Chef,"Okay, that was pretty good, Pip, but you're supposed to hit the kids on the other team."
1481,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Ow, my nose! You broke my nose!"
1482,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Damn, Pip. I didn't know you had it in you."
1483,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Ogh! I'm dreadfully sorry!
1484,2,5,Chef,"That nose is bleeding pretty bad, Kyle. I think you might have to go to the nurse's office."
1485,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[Gasp.] No. No, it'll be okay!"
1486,2,5,Chef,"Sorry, son. You'll have to let the nurse look at it. Come on."
1487,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Oh-- Noooo!
1488,2,5,Eric Cartman,[Ominously.] Dude! He's going to the nurse's office.
1489,2,5,Clyde Donovan,I heard the school nurse is hideously deformed.
1490,2,5,Bebe Stevens,I heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch.
1491,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Stan? Has anybody actually seen the nurse, and come back to tell about it?"
1492,2,5,Stan Marsh,"[Somberly.] No, Cartman. Nobody ever has."
1493,2,5,Nurse Gollum,Are you Kyle Broflovski?
1494,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ye-yes.
1495,2,5,Nurse Gollum,I'm the school nurse. Did you hurt your nose?
1496,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ye-yes.
1497,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Young man, Why do you have your eyes closed? I'm not gonna hurt you."
1498,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,I know.
1499,2,5,Nurse Gollum,So open them.
1500,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Oh! Phew.
1501,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Now, what seems to be the problem?"
1502,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, I just hit my nose playing dodgeball."
1503,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh. Well, I'll get you an ice pack."
1504,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,AAGGGGGHHHH!!
1505,2,5,Nurse Gollum,What?
1506,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,OOOOOHHHHH MY GOD!!
1507,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, I see you've noticed my disorder. I have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head."
1508,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,AAAARRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!
1509,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"...And when she moved up and down, the little fetus jiggled."
1510,2,5,Boys,Eewwww!
1511,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Did it talk? The little fetus, did it talk?"
1512,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,No. No-it looked dead.
1513,2,5,Boys,Eewwww!
1514,2,5,Stan Marsh,Wa-was it wearing clothes?
1515,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where is she gonna get fetus clothes?"
1516,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah. Eeww."
1517,2,5,Boys,Eewwww!
1518,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,And then she walked over to--
1519,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle! That is enough! I've been reading up on your poor nurse's condition, and it is nothing to be made fun of. It's called ""conjoined twin myslexia""."
1520,2,5,Eric Cartman,Who the hell cares what it's called? As long as she doesn't have to touch me...
1521,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Now, that's just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against. Sit down, boys."
1522,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"You see boys, sometimes, when babies are born, they're born as twins. But sometimes the twins get hooked together, and they're born as Siamese twins."
1523,2,5,The Boys,Gross!
1524,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"But sometimes, after the Siamese twins are joined together, one of the twins dies before birth. The living baby is born with the dead baby still attached."
1525,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Sometimes, this dead twin is inside the living person, so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it!"
1526,2,5,Stan Marsh,AGGGGGGHHHHHH!
1527,2,5,Eric Cartman,AGGHHH! Let me live! AGGGHHH!
1528,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"So now that you're educated about her disease, you won't need to make fun of her. Right, bubbe?"
1529,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Uhhhh... Yeah.
1530,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Can you imagine that poor, poor woman?"
1531,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,Mm-hmm.
1532,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Feeling like an outcast, being ridiculed every day..."
1533,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,Mm-hmm.
1534,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Hello?
1535,2,5,Sharon Marsh,"Hello, Sheila? It's Sharon, Stan's mother."
1536,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, yes. Hello, Sharon."
1537,2,5,Sharon Marsh,"Sheila, I was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick?"
1538,2,5,Stan Marsh,No! I have to get it out!
1539,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, Sharon, I was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia."
1540,2,5,Sharon Marsh,So this is your fault.
1541,2,5,Stan Marsh,ARRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!
1542,2,5,Randy Marsh,"Damn it, stop."
1543,2,5,Randy Marsh,Oh!
1544,2,5,Randy Marsh,Damn it!
1545,2,5,Sharon Marsh,"Would you do me a favor? Next time you want to scare the hell out of my child, just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead?"
1546,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,[Undaunted.] That does it! I must educate the entire town about this awful disease!
1547,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,Mm-hmm.
1548,2,5,Stan Marsh,"[To Cartman.] Dude, I don't get it. Why are we playing dodgeball again?"
1549,2,5,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I thought we only played on Fridays.
1550,2,5,Chef,[Arriving with a letter.] Children! Great news! We've been asked to play in the State Finals for dodgeball!
1551,2,5,All,Awww...
1552,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Aw, do we have to?"
1553,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Can't we just play with that big parachute again or something?
1554,2,5,Chef,"You-you don't understand, children. If we can win State, we can play in the Nationals in Washington, D.C.!"
1555,2,5,Eric Cartman,Heyh! They have a zoo there!
1556,2,5,Chef,"That's right! Now, come on! We have a lot of practicing to do!"
1557,2,5,Stan Marsh,Aren't we supposed to have won something in order to go to State Finals?
1558,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Pip. Do you wanna be on my team again?"
1559,2,5,Pip Pirrip,I'd love to!
1560,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Now, let's try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time, Frenchy."
1561,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Hey! I get quite disturbed when you call me that! You shouldn't make fun of foreigners.
1562,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"And besides, I hate French people."
1563,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Well, Mrs. Broflovski, it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again. What seems to be pissing you off today?"
1564,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Nothing is pissing me off! I just wanta start a movement.
1565,2,5,Principal Victoria,O-of course you do.
1566,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,I want to talk to you all about your school nurse.
1567,2,5,Mr Mackey,"Uh, Nurse Gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--"
1568,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"No, no no. I'm not upset about her. I want to make the public aware of her. Her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of."
1569,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh, and uh, what disease is that?"
1570,2,5,Mr Mackey,"Uh, Principal Victoria, Nurse Gollum has conjoined twin myslexia."
1571,2,5,Principal Victoria,What's that?
1572,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,She has a dead fetus attached to her head.
1573,2,5,Principal Victoria,[Gasp.] She does?
1574,2,5,Mr Mackey,Y-you never noticed that?
1575,2,5,Principal Victoria,"No-o, I never did."
1576,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, that's exactly what I'm talking about. This poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast. It is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town!"
1577,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Did you say a fetus, sticking out from her head?"
1578,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,I want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening. I'd appreciate it if both you and Mr. Mackey would attend.
1579,2,5,Mr Mackey,Do we have to eat kosher stuff?
1580,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Well, I'll talk to Nurse Gollum, but I'm sure she'll be delighted. Let's say around 8:00?"
1581,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Wonderful!
1582,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Now, you did say she has a fetus on her head?"
1583,2,5,Chef,"[Rising.] Okay children. [Encouraging] Now, who's gonna win the State Finals?"
1584,2,5,Clyde Donovan,Denver?
1585,2,5,Chef,"Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!
Here we go Ca-ows, here we go: Unh, unh!"
1586,2,5,Chef,I think we need to get off on this exit.
1587,2,5,Mrs Crabtre,"SIT DOWN, KID!!"
1588,2,5,Chef,But it's quicker to get to the Denver school that way!
1589,2,5,Ms Crabtree,DO YOU WANT AN OFFICE REFERRAL?!
1590,2,5,Chef,"How many times do I have to explain this to you?! I'm not a student! You can't give me an office referral, and-!"
1591,2,5,Ms Crabtree,I SAID SIT DOOWWN!!!
1592,2,5,Chef,"[Sits down.] Yes, ma'am."
1593,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude, this is a school?"
1594,2,5,Bob Thomas,"Hello, there. I'm Bob Thomas, the coach for the Denver Cougars."
1595,2,5,Chef,"I'm Chef, coach of the South Park Cows."
1596,2,5,Bob Thomas,"Well, I certainly want to thank you for bringing your team down. Apparently, nobody else would play us, because they knew we'd just beat 'em silly. So I told the school board to find me some hick school from the mountains, and here you are."
1597,2,5,Bob Thomas,"You're from South Park, yeah?"
1598,2,5,Chef,[In a low tone.] Yeah.
1599,2,5,Bob Thomas,"My G-hod, amazing where people can live nowadays. Well, we might as well get this over with; we've gotta start thinking about D.C. Promise we won't make it too painful."
1600,2,5,Referee,Play ball!
1601,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"So, uhh, where did you get your degree, Nurse Gollum?"
1602,2,5,Nurse Gollum,Colorado State.
1603,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Ahhh.
1604,2,5,Principal Victoria,Oh.
1605,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Sheila, could you pass me the dead fetus?"
1606,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,"I mean, gravy."
1607,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,Ow!
1608,2,5,Token Black,Ow!
1609,2,5,Chef,"Dammit, come on!"
1610,2,5,Chef,Somebody catch the ball!
1611,2,5,Bob Thomas,"All right, boys, just five more of the little bastards to go!"
1612,2,5,Eric Cartman,"I caught it, I caught it!"
1613,2,5,Player 1,"Oh, that's not fair! He's so fat, it stuck in his belly!"
1614,2,5,Referee 2,South Park on offense!
1615,2,5,Chef,"Great job, children! Just stay focused now."
1616,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Go for it, Pip."
1617,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Oh, bother."
1618,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, you Frenchy little frog!"
1619,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Gagghh!
1620,2,5,Chef,"Whoa-ho-ho-ho! Great shot, Pip!"
1621,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Eh, sooo, I hear that the South Park Cows are playing for the State Finals in dodgeball tonight."
1622,2,5,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, but you know, it-it doesn't matter though. The-the Denver team always wins, m'kay?"
1623,2,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, I don't know. I think our boys might just have the dead fetus to win-- Heart!"
1624,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,Gerald!
1625,2,5,Shiela,Keep your damn mouth shut!
1626,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I-it's okay, Ms. Broflovski. Really."
1627,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"[Exhales.] Please forgive us. I-I'm terribly sorry, Nurse Gollum."
1628,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"No, I'm quite secure with it."
1629,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,I have felt so bad ever since I heard the boys making fun of you--
1630,2,5,Nurse Gollum,They're just young boys. Joking is a way for them to come to terms with what they don't understand.
1631,2,5,Mr Mackey,Could I get some more pork?
1632,2,5,Principal Victoria,"So did you ever think of just, you know, having it cut off?"
1633,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Yes, Principal Victoria, the thought had occurred to me. Unfortunately, it would mean my death."
1634,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Ooohh, so I suppose that's out. Uh-how about a hat, then?"
1635,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"No, really, I don't need a--"
1636,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day. No big whoop."
1637,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I really appreciate what you're trying to do here, but it's not necessary. I'm a pretty happy person."
1638,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,I've got it! We could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you.
1639,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Ooohh, yeess, a Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week. You know, that has a nice ring."
1640,2,5,Nurse Gollum,But I really don't think--
1641,2,5,Mr Mackey,"Th-the school could put out pamphlets, m'kay? And we could have seminars to educate, m'kay?"
1642,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Ooooh, this is so exciting! I'm gonna get the mayor on the phone right now!"
1643,2,5,Chef,"You got just one more, Pip. You get this kid, and we are State Champions."
1644,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and if you don't, you're a big dumb-ass European hippie piece of crap."
1645,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Get him, Frenchy!"
1646,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Gaagghh!
1647,2,5,Referee 2,South Park wins!
1648,2,5,Chef,"We did it, children, we did it! We're going to Washington, D.C.!"
1649,2,5,Player 6,Uh-hu-hu-hu-howieee!
1650,2,5,Player 6,It hur-hurts! Owieee!
1651,2,5,Player 6,"Mommy, it huurts! I-it hur-hurts!"
1652,2,5,Chef,"Oh, sorry about whoopin' your ass there, Coach!

Oooh, baby, come on
Just whooped Denver's ass
Gonna need some cream for your ass
It's all swollen and red"
1653,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed a great week for South Park. Ms. Hermans has opened the east wing of the library, and our own South Park Cows Elementary School Dodgeball Team is going to the national finals..."
1654,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,...where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the Washington team.
1655,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"But most importantly, this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease: conjoined twin myslexia. And so it is in honor of this that I declare this exciting week as Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week!"
1656,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, let's kick off our week long festivities with the first annual Grand Conjoined Parade!"
1657,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,Let's hear it for these brave souls!
1658,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,What a glorious parade that was! Let's hear it for the parade coordinators!
1659,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"You know, Mayor, I really should be accompanying those kids to Washington in case they get hurt. That is my job."
1660,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,[The mic is still on.] Nonsense. This is your week. You aren't going anywhere.
1661,2,5,Chef,"How much further is Washington, D.C.?"
1662,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,"SIT DOWN, KID!!"
1663,2,5,Chef,"I need to know how far it is, lady!"
1664,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,I SAID SIT DOWN!!!
1665,2,5,Chef,"[Grumbling.] Yeah, whatever, you old, dried-up, fat hog."
1666,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
1667,2,5,Chef,"I said, ""I've always wanted to visit Prague."""
1668,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,"Oh, me too."
1669,2,5,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] Okay, what have you got?"
1670,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Some hadka fish, some gafagga..."
1671,2,5,Eric Cartman,[Quickly.] I got a jelly roll! I got a jelly roll!
1672,2,5,Stan Marsh,Sweet! A jelly roll is perfect!
1673,2,5,Stan Marsh,Places!
1674,2,5,Ms Crabtree,ARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!
1675,2,5,Kids,Whoa!
1676,2,5,Kenny McCormick,(Sheesh!)
1677,2,5,Chef,"Damn, man. This is the big time, alright."
1678,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we're hungry."
1679,2,5,Chef,"You can eat after the game. You children win this one, and you're National Champions! Then you can go on and play the Chinese."
1680,2,5,Eric Cartman,My mom says there's a lot of black people in China.
1681,2,5,Chef,What?
1682,2,5,Referee,Are you Chef?
1683,2,5,Chef,Yeah.
1684,2,5,Referee,"The Washington team has forfeited the game. Congratulations, you're national champions."
1685,2,5,Chef,"What? We did it! Children, we won!"
1686,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, that was easy."
1687,2,5,Announcer,"Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear a round of applause for the new national champions of dodgeball, the South Park Cows!"
1688,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, why did you guys forfeit?"
1689,2,5,Player,You mean you don't know?
1690,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Know what?
1691,2,5,Player,Last year's national champions were the Austin Pirates. They played China for the world championship. Only four of them came back alive. Chinese dodgeball players aren't like us.
1692,2,5,Master,Bush langli. Woon taun. Waya ching gia!
1693,2,5,Player,"[Voice-over.] They do nothing but dodgeball, day in, and day out. They use steroids and advanced training equipment to make them, not kids, but animals."
1694,2,5,Player,"Well, good luck. We've got our futures to think about."
1695,2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, back in the bus."
1696,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"And so, at this honorary dinner we take a look back at our beloved Nurse Gollum and the brave life she has lived. Roll the tape, please, Mr. Garrison."
1697,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, no..!"
1698,2,5,Singer,"[The video begins.]

You've got the strength, you've got the courage
Even with a dead fetus on your head
You carry on
You fight for tomorrow
Dead fetus or no, you never let go
You're my conjoined-twin-dead-thing-hanging-off-your-head woman"
1699,2,5,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, that was so touching."
1700,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"[With envelope in hand.] And now, friends, it's time to present the Lifetime Conjoined Twin Achievement Award. This award goes to outstanding conjoined twins who have made a mark on society. And the winner is... [Reaches into the envelope.]"
1701,2,5,Nurse Gollum,[Derisively.] Nurse Gollum.
1702,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,Nurse Gollum!!
1703,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Oh, boy."
1704,2,5,Jimbo Kern,"[Interrupting.] Excuse me, Mayor, but I just received some news that you might all be interested in."
1705,2,5,Jimbo Kern,"Our South Park Cows have just beaten the Washington dodgeball team, and are on their way to the world championship in China."
1706,2,5,Chef,"Okay, children, now, we're almost to China. I want you all to try and focus on your game."
1707,2,5,Stan Marsh,"But Chef, we don't wanna play the Chinese!"
1708,2,5,Chef,"Nonsense! If we win this one, we're world champions."
1709,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,But we could get killed!
1710,2,5,Chef,And just what price would you pay for eternal glory?
1711,2,5,Chef,"Just imagine: a big yellow ""Dodgeball Champions"" banner hanging in the cafeteria! Imagine it!"
1712,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Chef has lost it."
1713,2,5,Chef,"You'll be in the news all over the world. South Park will finally have a sport that it's good at. Ohh, children, it'll be glorious!"
1714,2,5,Eric Cartman,"So, Captain Ahab has to get his whale, huh?"
1715,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what does that mean?"
1716,2,5,Eric Cartman,I dunno.
1717,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey, isn't that kid Kevin Chinese?"
1718,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you're from China."
1719,2,5,Kevin Stoley,"No, I'm from America. My parents are Chinese."
1720,2,5,Stan Marsh,Tell us how the Chinese play dodgeball!
1721,2,5,Kevin Stoley,"I have no idea, dude."
1722,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Come on, rice picker!"
1723,2,5,Chef,"Hey, hey hey!"
1724,2,5,Chef,"Children, that's not cool! You don't make fun of somebody because of their ethnicity."
1725,2,5,Stan Marsh,You don't?
1726,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"But Chef, you just ripped on Chinese people."
1727,2,5,Chef,"No, no, no, no, no, that's different. I made fun of them because they are from China. You see, it's not okay to make fun of an American because they're black, brown, or whatever, but it is okay to make fun of foreigners because they are from another country."
1728,2,5,Stan Marsh,Ohhh.
1729,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Ohhh.
1730,2,5,Eric Cartman,"[At the same time.] Oooh, I get it."
1731,2,5,Kevin Stoley,[Vindicated.] Yeah.
1732,2,5,Mrs Crabtree,[Slamming on the brakes.] AAAGGGGHHHH!
1733,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Hiit ita wita great pride, that huwe huwelcome ourn American friend. Now let the..."
1734,2,5,Chinese Commentator,...champion of dodgeball be deshide!
1735,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude. China's fucked up."
1736,2,5,Referee,Take places!
1737,2,5,Chef,"All right, let's go, Cows! Let's show 'em what we've got!"
1738,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Okay, Tom, rooks rike A-mericans are getting ready to play. I don't suppose they'll have any problems seeing the ball with their big American eyes!"
1739,2,5,Tom,Yeah. Good thing they have those big eyes so that they don't have to rery on that amazing American interrect.
1740,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Oh, you say such things."
1741,2,5,Tom,That's a zinger!
1742,2,5,Referee,Praaayyy braal!
1743,2,5,Chef,Holy crap..!
1744,2,5,Chef,God damn...
1745,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Hey, hey, what do you call white American person with PhD in a physics and-a math?"
1746,2,5,Tom,"Ah, I don't know. What?"
1747,2,5,Chinese Commentator,Stupid American!
1748,2,5,Tom,"Aw, no way!!"
1749,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Oooh, another American is down! It's numbuh-- uuhhh... Oh, I don't know. All American look alike!"
1750,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
1751,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,[Laying on his side and out of breath.] You... bastards...
1752,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Oooh, my, I haven't seen an American die like that since Abraham Lincoln!"
1753,2,5,Tom,"Dude, that is-a not cool! You're gonna get us into trouble again."
1754,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, on this fourth day of Conjoined Twin Myslexia Week, all our prayers are with our little South Park Cows now playing their hearts out in China."
1755,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Now, join me in saluting our Cows and help make Nurse Gollum not feel like an outcast with our first official Conjoined Twin Myslexia hats!"
1756,2,5,Chinese Commentator,And there is-a only a one South Park prayer left.
1757,2,5,Chinese Commentator,Still all Chinese prayer. This should be over veerry shortly.
1758,2,5,Chinese kid,Come on! Throw ball!
1759,2,5,Tom,"Hey, you wanna hear my impersonation of American?"
1760,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Yeah, yeah!"
1761,2,5,Tom,"Ah, okay."
1762,2,5,Tom,"Hey, I really, really want that. That looks good."
1763,2,5,Chinese Commentator,"Hey, hey. Let me try, let me try."
1764,2,5,Chinese Commentator,I'll use my credit card.
1765,2,5,Chinese Commentator,Eh-eh-uh... Do you have any non-dairy creamer?
1766,2,5,Tom,"Yes yes! [Laughs.] Y'all come a-back now, you hear?"
1767,2,5,Chef,"[Crestfallen.] Oh, what have I done?"
1768,2,5,Chef,"You know, Eric, I just realized something. I have been obsessed, and obsession isn't good."
1769,2,5,Chef,"If we had won the world championship, what then?"
1770,2,5,Chef,It would only be a bigger letdown the next year if we didn't win! Our lives would have to revolve around dodgeball. Our lives were fine before.
1771,2,5,Chef,"Oh, I'm sorry, children. I let it all go to my head. Can you ever forgive me?"
1772,2,5,Chef,"Come on, forget this stupid game. Let's go home."
1773,2,5,Chinese kid,Come on! Throw ball!
1774,2,5,Kevin Stoley,"[Walking over to player 70.] Hey, if you wanna make him throw the ball, say this."
1775,2,5,Player 7,"Thanks, you American dumbass! [Reads it.] ""You French piece of crap! Throw ball!"""
1776,2,5,Player 7,"""What's the matter, Frenchy? You got crepes in your ears."""
1777,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Arrggghhh!
1778,2,5,Chinese Commentator,And the winner is South Park Cows!
1779,2,5,Pip Pirrip,"Everyone! Everyone, look! I won the game! We're world champions! Mr. Chef, Mr. Chef. South Park is the world champion in dodgeball. Oh, glorious day!"
1780,2,5,Chef,"Shut up, Pip."
1781,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, shut up, Pip. [To Chef.] Can we go home now?"
1782,2,5,Pip Pirrip,Did you all see? I can't believe I threw such a ball with my own arm. It was--
1783,2,5,Kids,"Shut up, Pip!"
1784,2,5,Chef,"Shut up, Pip!"
1785,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"As this year's Conjoined Twin Myslexia Awareness Week draws to a close, I would like to personally thank all of you for your enthusiastic cooperation."
1786,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Now, let's hear it one more time for our world champion South Park Cows!"
1787,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell is everyone wearing on their heads?
1788,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, let's hear from the woman of the week! The incredible, courageous Nurse Gollum!"
1789,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,Agghh!
1790,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's the freak nurse!"
1791,2,5,Eric Cartman,Holy crap!
1792,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Dammit, Kyle! We've been working all week against that kind of behavior!"
1793,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Well sorry, dude, we weren't here."
1794,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Thank you, Mayor. I uhhh, wa-I... I don't know what to say; this has been quite a week."
1795,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,[Wiping away a tear.] She's really touched.
1796,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"What I really wanna say is... well, -egh-- This may sound odd coming from a woman with a fetus sticking out of her head, but... you're all a bunch of freaks!"
1797,2,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Uhhh, freaks with big hearts! And now--"
1798,2,5,Nurse Gollum,Don't you realize that the last thing I ever wanted was to be singled out?
1799,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"I just wanted to do my job and live my life like any normal person, but instead you've made everybody focus on my handicap all week long."
1800,2,5,Nurse Gollum,"Look, I don't want to be treated different. I don't want to be treated special orh-or treated gingerly. I just want to be ridiculed, shouted at, and made fun of like all the rest of you do to each other."
1801,2,5,Nurse gollum,And take those stupid things off your heads!
1802,2,5,Principal Victoria,"Oh, my, what an ungrateful bitch."
1803,2,5,Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah, the nerve of some people."
1804,2,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, you know, that nurse is actually pretty cool."
1805,2,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, maybe that dead fetus makes her smarter."
1806,2,5,Eric Cartman,I love you guys.
1807,2,5,Eric Cartman,"Ah, screw you guys!"
1808,2,6,Announcer,"And now back to Huntin' and Killin'  with South Park's favorite hunters, Jimbo and Ned!"
1809,2,6,Jimbo Kern,"Hi, I'm Jimbo Kern, and this here is Ned. Say hi, Ned."
1810,2,6,Ned Gerblansky,"M-hi, Ned."
1811,2,6,Jimbo Kern,"Arrgh-ha-ha-ha! Now, isn't that great?"
1812,2,7,Ms Crabtree,BE QUIET BACK THERRE! THESE ROADS ARE SLIICK!
1813,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman!"
1814,2,7,Eric Cartman,What?
1815,2,7,Stan Marsh,Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?
1816,2,7,Eric Cartman,"[Finishes a bite.] Hmmm, let me see. No!"
1817,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, fatass! You shouldn't be eating all that cake anyway!"
1818,2,7,Eric Cartman,Mmm. It's chocolaty and delightful.
1819,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Give us some, Cartman!"
1820,2,7,Ms Crabtree,[Turns around.] BE QUIET BACK THERRE!
1821,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there."
1822,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, the road is always snowy."
1823,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I know, but, it's really snowy today."
1824,2,7,Eric Cartman,"[Now baiting.] Mmm. I can't possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. [Resumes eating.]"
1825,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman!"
1826,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"Okay, that does it! Y'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies!"
1827,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would."
1828,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, she would, dude. She would."
1829,2,7,Ms Crabtree,GOODD!
1830,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!"
1831,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now."
1832,2,7,Eric Cartman,"[Exhausted.] I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I'll try."
1833,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!"
1834,2,7,Ms Crabtree,[Spins around.] WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
1835,2,7,Ms Crabtree,Whoa oh.
1836,2,7,Ms Crabtree,Hold oonn! Aaaaa!
1837,2,7,Kids,Aaaah!
1838,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'm scared!
1839,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"BE QUIET, KID!"
1840,2,7,All,Aaaah!
1841,2,7,Guide,...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They're indigenous to this area.
1842,2,7,The Kids,Aaaah!
1843,2,7,Wife,What was that?
1844,2,7,Guide,[Turns.] What was what?
1845,2,7,All,Aaaah-
1846,2,7,Eric Cartman,All done!
1847,2,7,Ms Crabtree,SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!
1848,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"I SAID 'QUIET,' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY!"
1849,2,7,Stan Marsh,Where are we?
1850,2,7,Ms Crabtree,I have no idea.
1851,2,7,Stan Marsh,I don't think we're in a very safe spot.
1852,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what are we supposed to do?"
1853,2,7,Ms Crabtree,Just keep your trap shut. I'll consult the manual.
1854,2,7,Eric Cartman,Ms. Crabtree?
1855,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"SHUT UP, KIID! I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!"
1856,2,7,Trainer,"[The video starts.] Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver's video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you've calmed down the children and kept order by using the 'keep quiet or I'll kill the bunny' technique. Now, it's time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, 'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.'"
1857,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!"
1858,2,7,Trainer,"That's right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver's code: 'Sit down. And shut up!'"
1859,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"I'm goin' for help. Ah'll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don't get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!"
1860,2,7,Boy In The Red Shirt,"Hey, why doesn't the scary monster eat her?"
1861,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don't eat big fat smelly bitches!"
1862,2,7,Ms Crabtree,WHAT DID YOU SAY?!
1863,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I said, 'Larry King won't grant me three wishes.'"
1864,2,7,Ms Crabtree,Oh.
1865,2,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is not good! She could've at least kept the heat on."
1866,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"Had to happen to me, didn't it?"
1867,2,7,Truck Driver,"Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too-"
1868,2,7,Truck Driver,"Whoa uhih, it's supper time. Come to poppa."
1869,2,7,Truck Driver,"Whoa uh heh hello, little lady-yeh. Goin' my way?"
1870,2,7,Ms Crabtree,SHUT UP AND HELP ME INTO THIS THIING!
1871,2,7,Truck Driver,Whoa. Hehum huh.
1872,2,7,Ms Crabtree,[Grunts.] Yeah! [Now seated.] COME ON! I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY!
1873,2,7,Truck Driver,"Uh huh. Alright, sure, of course."
1874,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST TOWN AND MAKE IT SNAPPY, YOU FREAK-ASS CRACKPOT!"
1875,2,7,Truck Driver,"Uuuh, yeh, yes ma'am. Righta right away, ma'am.}"
1876,2,7,Truck Driver,"So uh... Uhwhat's a- fragile little doe like yourself doin' out on a, on a night like this?"
1877,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"LOOK, MISTER, I GOT A BUSLOAD OF KIDS TRAPPED UP ON THAT PASS! I NEED A CRANE, HELICOPTERS, ALL THAT CRAP! HERE, LET ME HAVE SOME O' YOUR ASPIRIN!"
1878,2,7,Truck Driver,"Uh uh- ma'am, those are actually roofies."
1879,2,7,Ms Crabtree,"ROOFIES, ASPIRIN, RIGHT NOW I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS!"
1880,2,7,Ms Crabtree,HOW FAR TO THE NEAREST TOOWWN?!
1881,2,7,Truck Driver,Mm-... mm-it's a ways.
1882,2,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys. What if Ms. Crabtree doesn't come back, and we're all trapped here forever."
1883,2,7,Kids,"[Gasp, then individually.] What? Huh?"
1884,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,"We couldn't get trapped here forever, Cartman. We'd die after a couple of days."
1885,2,7,Stan Marsh,Dude!
1886,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1887,2,7,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna die on this- bus with you assholes! [Panics.] You guys suck!
1888,2,7,Stan Marsh,Would you just relax? We've been in a lot worse situations than this and come out of it just fine.
1889,2,7,Kyle Broflovski,Worse than this?
1890,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?"
1891,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!"
1892,2,8,Mr Garrison,The prank is over!
1893,2,8,Mr Garrison,"You think I can't get along without Mr. Hat, don't you? You think I can't live without him? Well, I can! He's just a puppet. I don't need him. You see? Watch."
1894,2,8,Mr Garrison,God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!
1895,2,8,Kids,Yea--
1896,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh no, you don't! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn't start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!"
1897,2,8,Kids,Awww..!
1898,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Now, I'm going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!"
1899,2,8,Mr Garrison,Okay. I'm going to turn around now.
1900,2,8,Mr Garrison,Shit!
1901,2,8,Pip,Where did everybody go?
1902,2,8,Kids,Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!
1903,2,8,Mother,"Oh golly, Kevin, honey."
1904,2,8,Father,"Good to see you again, son."
1905,2,8,Man,Looks like winter's right around the corner. Better get some firewood ready.
1906,2,8,Pip,"Oh, happy summer, gentlemen!"
1907,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Pip."
1908,2,8,Pip,"Right-o. Uh... Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?"
1909,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean?
1910,2,8,Pip,"Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can't be left alone. You see, my parents are dead."
1911,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Your parents are dead? Goddamn, you suck, Pip!"
1912,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah, dude, it's summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks."
1913,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.
1914,2,8,Stan Marsh,"I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's butt."
1915,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman's cat.
1916,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty's ass, I'll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!"
1917,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, Cartman!"
1918,2,8,Eric Cartman,"[Mumbles.] Well, I'm just saying na, don't mess with Kitty na."
1919,2,8,Stu,"Hi, fellas."
1920,2,8,Boys,"Hi, Stu."
1921,2,8,Stu,What can I do for you?
1922,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,We wanna buy M-80s.
1923,2,8,Stan Marsh,The kind that fit in Cartman's cat's ass.
1924,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that's it!"
1925,2,8,Eric Cartman,Screw you guys! I'm going home.
1926,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,What a baby.
1927,2,8,Stan Marsh,"So, we'll have ten M-80s, please."
1928,2,8,Stu,"I'm sorry, fellas. Haven't you heard?"
1929,2,8,Stan Marsh,Heard what?
1930,2,8,Stu,All fireworks have been banned in Colorado.
1931,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,What do ya mean?
1932,2,8,Stu,It was in the paper this morning.
1933,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude! Just 'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don't get to buy M-80s?"
1934,2,8,Stu,Right.
1935,2,8,Stan Marsh,How can they do this to us? Doesn't anyone believe in tradition anymore?
1936,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. We've been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.
1937,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh gosh, killed Kenny!"
1938,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Oo bastards!
1939,2,8,Stan Marsh,"A summer without fireworks is like I don't know, but it's like-- It sucks ass."
1940,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?"
1941,2,8,Stu,I can still sell snakes.
1942,2,8,Stan Kyle Kenny,Awww..!
1943,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"This is absurd! We need fireworks for our Fourth of July celebration at the lake. [Listens.] I don't care that some twerp blew his hands off! We've got to have fireworks for our picnic! Hold on, I've got another call. [Switch.] Hello? No, I don't know where Mr. Hat is! Jesus, Garrison. I've got bigger problems! [Switch.] Hello, yes? Now what am I supposed to do about our Fourth of July show at the lake? No, I don't want snakes! This is an outrage! Get me the Mayor! I know that, smart-ass, I was being ironic..! [Hangs up.]"
1944,2,8,Officer Barbrady,"[Emerging from under her desk.] I'm sorry, Mayor, but I couldn't find the little man in the boat."
1945,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, keep looking. [Pushes him down.]"
1946,2,8,Officer Barbrady,Oh?
1947,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,This is ridiculous. We can't have a celebration without fireworks. Whoever heard of a Fourth of July picnic with snakes?
1948,2,8,Officer Barbrady,"[From under the desk.] Oh, I like snakes. You light 'em and they grow and grow."
1949,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Wait a minute. That's it! I got it! This Fourth of July, South Park will make history by having the largest snake in the world! The press will love it. I'll be on the front pa-- [Swoons.] Oooooogh..."
1950,2,8,Officer Barbrady,I found him.
1951,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Man, it's hot out here."
1952,2,8,Eric Cartman,What do you guys want to do? We've got the whole summer to play!
1953,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what are we supposed to do? We always just play with fireworks."
1954,2,8,Stan Marsh,I know! Let's go sledding!
1955,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
1956,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Cartman, get on."
1957,2,8,Eric Cartman,Stan?
1958,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's go, dude. We're ready."
1959,2,8,Stan Marsh,"What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?"
1960,2,8,Eric Cartman,Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong with this picture?
1961,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Your fat ass isn't on the sled!
1962,2,8,Eric Cartman,Ugh... Whatever.
1963,2,8,Stan Marsh,What the hell is going on?
1964,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Hey there, boys!"
1965,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
1966,2,8,Jimbo Kern,How come you're not blowin' things up? It's summer.
1967,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Didn't you hear? They outlawed fireworks 'cause a little boy blew off his hands.
1968,2,8,Jimbo Kern,What?!
1969,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they're not even having them at the lake this year."
1970,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Oh my God! [Revs up.] Well, don't worry boys, Uncle Jimbo is on the case. [Drives off.] Buckle your seat belt, Ned."
1971,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmm-where are we going?
1972,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Mxico, my amigo."
1973,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmm-why are we going to Mxico?
1974,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"To buy fireworks. Just 'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn't mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?"
1975,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Are fireworks legal in Mexico?
1976,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Hell, everything's legal in Mxico. It's the American way."
1977,2,8,Charlie,"At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--"
1978,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
1979,2,8,Charlie,"Oh, o-kay. [To himself.] Let's see..."
1980,2,8,Charlie,"Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake."
1981,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Ooooh!
1982,2,8,Charlie,We'll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.
1983,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,[Writes notes.] Comanche helicopters...
1984,2,8,Charlie,"[Flips page.] Then we'll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time."
1985,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time..."
1986,2,8,Charlie,"Once lit, the snake will grow."
1987,2,8,Charlie,And good times will be had by all.
1988,2,8,Aide 1,Wonderful.
1989,2,8,Aide 2,Spectacular.
1990,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We're gonna need an orchestra to play The Stars and Stripes!"
1991,2,8,Aide 1,Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of Mary Had a Little Lamb at their last concert.
1992,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!
1993,2,8,Aide 2,"Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?"
1994,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Of course I do, you fuckin' asshole!"
1995,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[Singing.]
Dusty the dirtball..."
1996,2,8,Stan Marsh,Why does everything have to suck so bad in summer?
1997,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look, it's Mr. Garrison."
1998,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Hello, children. How is your summer going?"
1999,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison."
2000,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?"
2001,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that old thing? Why, I almost forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. Hat."
2002,2,8,Stan Marsh,That's good.
2003,2,8,Mr Garrison,Mr. Hat is just a puppet.
2004,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yup.
2005,2,8,Mr Garrison,Mr. Hat isn't real.
2006,2,8,Stan Marsh,Right.
2007,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys, my mom signed me up for swimming lessons at the community pool. You wanna come?"
2008,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the lamest thing I've heard heard."
2009,2,8,Eric Cartman,It is not!
2010,2,8,Stan Marsh,Everyone knows that the first graders pee in the community pool.
2011,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, Cartman, you're swimming around in first-grader pee."
2012,2,8,Eric Cartman,I am not swimming around in pee!
2013,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Whatever, dude."
2014,2,8,Eric Cartman,"My mom says that if I take swimming lessons, I could be in the Olympics someday."
2015,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[Grins with Stan.] Yeah, the Fat Ass Olympics."
2016,2,8,Eric Cartman,I'm trying to make the best out of a bad situation! I don't need to hear crap from a bunch of hippie freaks living in denial! Screw you guys! I'm going home.
2017,2,8,Stan Marsh,"But Cartman, we're trying to--"
2018,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, screw you guys. Home. [Leaves.]"
2019,2,8,Stan Marsh,"What does he mean, ""living in denial""?"
2020,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's Cartman. He's just being a dumb-ass like always."
2021,2,8,Stan Marsh,"There, how does that look?"
2022,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Like a..big hunk of dirt with a carrot sticking out of it.
2023,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Uh, crap..!"
2024,2,8,Eric Cartman,Eh-eh-eh-eh...
2025,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"Okay kids, everyone in the pool!"
2026,2,8,instructor,"Come on, Eric, we're gonna start now."
2027,2,8,Eric Cartman,Nuh-uh.
2028,2,8,Swimming Instructor,Just jump in.
2029,2,8,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna.
2030,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"It's not gonna hurt ya, hon. Just do it."
2031,2,8,Eric Cartman,Egh--
2032,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"There you go! Now just let the first graders swim by you, and then head towards us."
2033,2,8,Eric Cartman,Huh? First graders?
2034,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Awww! Weak! Weak! Oh, y-you sons of bitches!"
2035,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Where the hell is our firework? We only have 24 hours!
2036,2,8,Aide 2,I'm sure it'll be here any second.
2037,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Shut up!
2038,2,8,Aide 2,Copy that.
2039,2,8,South Park Elementary Orchestra Conductor,"Okay, children, I'm sure we're a little rusty. Where is Eric Cartman?"
2040,2,8,Stan Marsh,He's taking swimming lessons.
2041,2,8,South Park Elementary Orchestra Conductor,"Oh, dear. How are we supposed to sound good without our French horn section? Oh, let's try some scales first. C scale first. And..."
2042,2,8,South Park Elementary Orchestra Conductor,"Okay, that was pretty good. Let's play Mozart's Symphony No. 5."
2043,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, we're doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing."
2044,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Wait a minute... It's the snake!
2045,2,8,Officer Barbrady,"Let's move along, people. If you've seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you've seen them all."
2046,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Call everybody! The show's back on! Come on, we've only got one day to prepare!"
2047,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Buenos dias, mi amigo. Yo soy un Americano espectacularrr."
2048,2,8,Proprietor,Qu?
2049,2,8,Jimbo Kern,Yo necesito el fireworko spectacularrrr.
2050,2,8,Proprietor,Necesita usted un cohete grande?
2051,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Nnnn-no moleste el gato spectacularrrr.
2052,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Would you look at that, Ned? That's a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies have enough power to blast a fiery hole right through the ozone."
2053,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmm-they're spectacularrrr.
2054,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Ned, it's our job to get these to children all over America for the Fourth of July."
2055,2,8,Jimbo Kern,We'll be like Santa Claus on Christmas morning.
2056,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Hmmm-bueyno.
2057,2,8,Mr Garrison,Hello?
2058,2,8,Caller Mr Mackey,"Hello, is Mr. Hat there?"
2059,2,8,Mr Garrison,Is this some kind of joke?
2060,2,8,Caller Mr Mackey,[snickers] Yes.
2061,2,8,Mr Garrison,You go to hell! You go to hell and you die! I'm gonna find out who you are!
2062,2,8,Caller Mr Mackey,"I don't think you can, m'kay."
2063,2,8,Mr Garrison,Goddammit..!
2064,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"So, Lamb Chop, what would you like to do today?"
2065,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"Well, I'd like to sing you a song."
2066,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"Hey, let's sing one to-gether!"
2067,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"As long as we're together,
we can do anything
We can take on the whole darn world
We're happy as clams,
with plenty of pearls
Through thick and thin,
we've always been to-geth-er..."
2068,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,Whoa-aagghh! Aagghh! Aggh!
2069,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"No! Lamb Chop, no!"
2070,2,8,Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop,"Shari, help me... It burns! It burns..!"
2071,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"Eric, you have to get in the deep end sooner or later."
2072,2,8,Eric Cartman,Later's fine.
2073,2,8,Swimming Instructor,Just do your side stroke.
2074,2,8,Eric Cartman,I only know how to do it doggie style.
2075,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"That's doggie-paddle, Eric. Now come over here!"
2076,2,8,Eric Cartman,Can I do it doggie style?
2077,2,8,Swimming Instructor,Okay.
2078,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"That's it! That's it, you can do it!"
2079,2,8,Eric Cartman,Sweet..!
2080,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Awww, dammit! Aw, not again!"
2081,2,8,Swimming Instructor,"Come on, Eric!"
2082,2,8,Eric Cartman,No way! Those sons of bitches! I'm going home.
2083,2,8,Anchor,"Fourth of July is finally here, and with the state-wide ban on fireworks, people from all over Colorado are flocking to South Park. Here with a special report is a normal-looking guy with a funny name."
2084,2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Thanks, Tom. It looks like the firework ban won't be putting a damper on one town's festivities tonight. I'm here at Stark's Pond in South Park, where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history."
2085,2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Now, as most of you will probably remember, snakes are these little round disks that you light, and they spew out a little snake of black ash. Well, the South Park snake is over half a mile in diameter, and twenty stories high. I'm told that this event won't begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us."
2086,2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Alrighty then, looks like we're ready."
2087,2,8,Stan Marsh,"How are your swimming lessons going, Cartman?"
2088,2,8,Eric Cartman,Fine.
2089,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,I heard you won't even get in the deep end.
2090,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, you heard wrong, hippie!"
2091,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, good citizens of Colorado. It's my pleasure to be the first person to wish you all a happy Fourth of July! Let's start with our school band playing The Stars and Stripes!"
2092,2,8,South Park Elementary Orchestra Conductor,This is it. And a-one and a-two and a...
2093,2,8,Audience,Ooohhhh..!
2094,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,What is fuck is that?!
2095,2,8,Aide 2,I think it's The Stars and Stripes.
2096,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, hell. Light the snake!"
2097,2,8,Audience,Ooooooh!
2098,2,8,Audience,Ahhhhh!
2099,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Alright, Ned. Now we're coming up to the American border. They can't know that we have fireworks in the trunk. Just let me do the talking."
2100,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?"
2101,2,8,Guard,"Good evening, gentlemen."
2102,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Hello there, fellow American. We're just anxious to get back to our homeland."
2103,2,8,Guard,"Alright, I just need to ask you a few questions."
2104,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Fire away, we have nothing to hide."
2105,2,8,Guard,Is anyone other than the two of you traveling in this vehicle?
2106,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"No, sir."
2107,2,8,Guard,Do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
2108,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Yes. [Ned recoils.] I mean, no! No!"
2109,2,8,Guard,"Open your trunk, please, sir."
2110,2,8,Jimbo Kern,Damn! Damn! I always get that question wrong!
2111,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"My God, it's beautiful. It never fails to amaze me how I manage to overcome adversity."
2112,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Say uh, Charlie, when does that thing die out?"
2113,2,8,Charlie,Die out?
2114,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes, you know, expire, end."
2115,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,Hello? I'm asking you when it stops?
2116,2,8,Charlie,"Uhhh, I'm not sure; I never made one this big."
2117,2,8,Charlie,"I guess we didn't quite think this through, did we?"
2118,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,What?!
2119,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,[Looking up.] Dude! That thing is huge!
2120,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, they need to shut it off."
2121,2,8,Eric Cartman,[Distracted.] Hey! You guys are screwin' up the song!
2122,2,8,Man 1,Somebody stop it!
2123,2,8,Man 2,It's out of control!
2124,2,8,Stan Kyle Cartman,Aarrgghh!!
2125,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! Watch out!
2126,2,8,Kenny McCormick,(Waarrggh!!)
2127,2,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude! You guys, I really, really don't have time to tell you that-- Argghh..!)"
2128,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"
2129,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
2130,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"[Horrified.] Oh my God! [Grabs Charlie.] You tell me, how much longer this thing is gonna last?!"
2131,2,8,Charlie,Let's see. A normal-size snake lasts three minutes... [Mutters indistinctly.]
2132,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,So when does it run out?!
2133,2,8,Charlie,November. Of next year.
2134,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, hell..!"
2135,2,8,Creamy Goodness,"Well, we're coming up on nine hours, and the giant snake of South Park shows no signs of stopping. Residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop, but nothing seems to work."
2136,2,8,Tom Pusslicker,"Thanks, Creamy. Police are advising all citizens to stay indoors, not breathe the ashen air, and not ever light any giant snakes in the near future."
2137,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Man, this sucks."
2138,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"What should we do, dude? That big snake keeps growing; it's gonna demolish the whole state soon!"
2139,2,8,Stan Marsh,We should do what we always do. Ask Chef for help.
2140,2,8,Eric Cartman,Where is Chef?
2141,2,8,Chef,"[Slowly.]
Baby, you know you're the girl for me-ee
And all that I want to be-ee-ee is...
[Quickly.]
You and me
And her; simultaneous
You and me, and you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three; simultaneous
Ooh, that's right...


[The phone rings and Chef answers it.]
Hello? What? Oh, hello, children. It's a what?... A giant snake?... Killing everybody?!... Growing bigger?!... Children, you know I rarely say this but... Well, fudge ya.
[He hangs up and resumes singing.]


Simultaneous, you and me
And you and you
Simultaneous lovin', baby
Two or three..."
2142,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,What'd he say?
2143,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I think he told us to go fuck ourselves."
2144,2,8,Eric Cartman,Wow.
2145,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,How is that gonna help?
2146,2,8,Anchor,"All over America, the effects of the giant ash snake of South Park can be seen."
2147,2,8,Preacher,"Yea, let the spirit of Heavenly Father be blessed upon you."
2148,2,8,Assistant,"From this day on, all will be well."
2149,2,8,New Mormon,I already feel like things are getting better.
2150,2,8,Mr Garrison,And I can't sleep or think...
2151,2,8,Mr Garrison,Where would he have gone? Why would he leave?
2152,2,8,Dr Katz,"Well um, let me ask you this. Why? Wher-where do you think... Mr. Hat... went?"
2153,2,8,Mr Garrison,"How the fuck should I know? If I knew that, I wouldn't be seein' a fuckin' psychiatrist, would I?"
2154,2,8,Dr Katz,"Well I guess, I-I see what you're saying. Yeah."
2155,2,8,Mr Garrison,"At first I was sure one of the children took him, but then I remembered that Mr. Hat and I actually had a fight that morning."
2156,2,8,Dr Katz,Um... Ahem...
2157,2,8,Dr Katz,Are you gay?
2158,2,8,Mr Garrison,What?!
2159,2,8,Dr Katz,[Stammers.] It-it's j-just-- It's just a question.
2160,2,8,Mr Garrison,Are you propositioning me?
2161,2,8,Dr Katz,No.
2162,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, I can tell that that I am 100% not gay!"
2163,2,8,Dr Katz,"Well, I believe you, I... absolutely believe you."
2164,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Hat, on the other hand..."
2165,2,8,Dr Katz,Mr. Hat was gay?
2166,2,8,Mr Garrison,Sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations.
2167,2,8,Dr Katz,I see.
2168,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Sometimes Mr. Hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with Brett Favre, and a bottle of Thousand Island dressing."
2169,2,8,Dr Katz,That I did not need to know.
2170,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Well, I'm just sayin'."
2171,2,8,Mr Katz,"Mr. Garrison, I think that Mr. Hat was actually your gay side trying to come out. You see, it's-it's you that's gay, but, but you're in denial, so...you act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet."
2172,2,8,Dr Katz,What do you think about that?
2173,2,8,Mr Garrison,I think you're the loony one in this room.
2174,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Serves you right, you gay-bashing homo."
2175,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Well, Ned, looks like we missed Fourth of July again."
2176,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmmmmm-yup.
2177,2,8,Jimbo Kern,Dammit! Those poor kids must have been so disappointed to have nothin' but them stupid wussy snakes to light.
2178,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmm-well better luck next year.
2179,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, you're right. Okay, let's try again."
2180,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,[Reads cue card.] Mmmm-is anyone other than the two of you riding in this vehicle?
2181,2,8,Jimbo Kern,No.
2182,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmmm-do you have any firearms or explosives in the car?
2183,2,8,Jimbo Kern,[Hesitantly.] Yes?
2184,2,8,Jimbo Kern,Dammit! I got it wrong again! What's the answer again?
2185,2,8,Jimbo Kern,Holy smokes! What the hell is that?
2186,2,8,Ned Gerblansky,Mmm-it looks like my ex-wife!
2187,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Quick, Ned! This is our chance! The Hummer's outside!"
2188,2,8,"Brett Favre Green Bay QB, No. 4 (cameo)",Hi. I hasn't seen you in here before.
2189,2,8,Reporter,"As more and more cities are affected by the growing ash and the death toll rises to 3,000..."
2190,2,8,Reporter,...people from all over the country are looking to the Mayor of South Park for answers.
2191,2,8,Reporter,...And it appears as if the Mayor is going to explain matters now.
2192,2,8,Aide 1,"Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of South Park regrets that she cannot be here herself, but she is... sick."
2193,2,8,Reporter 2,"""Sick""?! What kind of lame excuse is that?"
2194,2,8,Print Reporter,You gotta be kidding me!
2195,2,8,Reporter 3,"Oh, this is ridiculous!"
2196,2,8,Reporter 4,"Come on, we want answers."
2197,2,8,Aide 2,Sh-she's having her period.
2198,2,8,Reporter 4,[Softly.] Oh.
2199,2,8,Aide 1,"We do, however, have an official statement for all the concerned cities about the matter with the giant snake that we can't seem to put out."
2200,2,8,Aide 2,"""We're sorry. Our bad."""
2201,2,8,Aide 1,"Thank you, that is all."
2202,2,8,Eric Cartman,Okay. No first graders around. I can swim to the deep end.
2203,2,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah... I can do it. I can do it. I can-- I'm gonna make it.
2204,2,8,Stan Marsh,How many days left in summer?
2205,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"A lot, I think."
2206,2,8,Stan Marsh,Dammit! I just want it to snow again!
2207,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't think it matters, dude. This giant snake is gonna kill everyone soon."
2208,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Buenos gracias, boys."
2209,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Hi, Uncle Jimbo."
2210,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, now, why the long faces?"
2211,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,We're bored.
2212,2,8,Stan Marsh,There's nothin' to do.
2213,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Well, I don't think those are problems..."
2214,2,8,Jimbo Kern,...that some Tijuana bottle rockets can't solve!
2215,2,8,Stan Kyle,Hooray!
2216,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Careful with those, now, those are dangerous."
2217,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Point 'em away from your eyes, now."
2218,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,Wow! These are huge!
2219,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Aw, look at 'em, Ned. Look how much happiness a little firepower can bring to a child."
2220,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, look! We blew up the snake!"
2221,2,8,Citizen,All the ash from the snake is putting the flame out.
2222,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Well, how do you like that? Bottle rockets saved the Fourth of July!"
2223,2,8,Stan Kyle,Hooray!
2224,2,8,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it to the deep end.
2225,2,8,Eric Cartman,I did it! I did it! I made it to the deep end! Hooray for me!
2226,2,8,Swimming Instructor,[Off-screen.] The snake's been destroyed. [Removes notice.] The pool's open!
2227,2,8,Eric Cartman,Huh?
2228,2,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, no, you sons of bitches! Aww, sons of bitches..!"
2229,2,8,Citizen 2,Look! They put out the snake!
2230,2,8,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes! Apparently, my plan to-o blow up the snake worked perfectly."
2231,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, look! It's snowing!"
2232,2,8,Jimbo Kern,"Well, it's snowing black ash, but what the hell."
2233,2,8,Stan Marsh,Winter's back!
2234,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Wow, it's a black blizzard!"
2235,2,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, where's Mr. Hat?"
2236,2,8,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a two-timin' whore. From now on, children, you're all gonna be learning from Mr. Twig."
2237,2,8,Mr Twig,"That's right, children. I'll see you in the fall."
2238,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Well, I can hardly wait."
2239,2,8,Chef,"Hey, children, everybody! I'm back! I'm back from Aruba! What the..?"
2240,2,8,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Chef!"
2241,2,8,Eric Cartman,How's it going?
2242,2,8,Man,"Howdy, Chef. How was your summer vacation?"
2243,2,8,Chef,"Okay! E-verbody get in a line, so I can whoop all your asses!"
2244,2,9,Robert Redford,"Why do we hold the Sundance Film Festival here, Phyllis? It's so painfully crowded."
2245,2,9,Phyllis,"Because. People from L.A. love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days, and this gives them an excuse."
2246,2,9,Robert Redford,"No, this used to be a quaint little mountain town. Now look at it. Sushi restaurants, upscale clothes stores, $25 parking, Liam Neeson... I tell you, Phyllis, I think we've tapped this town's resources out. We must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again."
2247,2,9,Phyllis,That's not a bad idea. But where?
2248,2,9,Man in background,Ching ching cha-ching.
2249,2,9,Man in foreground,Whoa.
2250,2,9,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children. I have some very exciting news for you... Oo-why don't you tell them, Mr. Twig?"
2251,2,9,Mr Twig,"That's right, Mr. Garrison. The First Annual South Park Film Festival begins today."
2252,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,Wow! Cool!
2253,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"They're not gonna show that stupid-ass Godzilla movie again, are they?"
2254,2,9,Mr Garrison,"Nono, Kyle. These are independent films."
2255,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Hoohh, like Independence Day? That sucked ass, too."
2256,2,9,Eric Cartman,"No, dude, independent films are those black and white hippie movies. They're always about gay cowboys eating pudding."
2257,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,No they're not! Independent films are produced outside the Hollywood system. They're movies about all the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.
2258,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Byeh, sure. Well, you show me one independent film that isn't about gay cowboys eating pudding!"
2259,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Once again, you have no idea what you're talking about, fatass!"
2260,2,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm not fat! I just haven't grown into my body yet, skinny bitch!"
2261,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,Hrmph!
2262,2,9,Mr Garrison,"Eric, if you call Wendy a bitch one more time, I'm sending you to the principal's office!"
2263,2,9,Eric Cartman,...bitch.
2264,2,9,Mr Garrison,"That's it Eric, you-!"
2265,2,9,Eric Cartman,I'm going!
2266,2,9,Mr Garrison,"Anyway, children, I want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it."
2267,2,9,Mr Garrison,"The first film showing is called Witness To Denial, and it's a sexual exploration piece about two women in love."
2268,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, my uncle Jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer."
2269,2,9,Director 1,"Norma, I want to shoot the script next month with Demi Moore instead."
2270,2,9,Director 2,[In shorts!] Well you can tell Spielberg he can kiss my ass!
2271,2,9,Mayor McDaniels,"[Walking about with one of her aides.] Wow, look at this, Johnson. Traffic jams at every intersection, hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd. It's almost like we're a real city."
2272,2,9,Eric Cartman,I can't believe I got sent to the principal's office because of your stupid girlfriend!
2273,2,9,Stan Marsh,She's not my girlfriend.
2274,2,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, that's because you vomit on her all the time.)"
2275,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Sick, Kenny."
2276,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Damn, dude. Look at all these people."
2277,2,9,Director 3,"[Rushing by with a cell phone.] I'm late for a screening, I'll call you from the theater."
2278,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,All this for a bunch of stupid movies?
2279,2,9,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
2280,2,9,The boys,"Hey, Chef."
2281,2,9,Stan Marsh,Whatcha doin'?
2282,2,9,Chef,"Children, this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities. Now I'm gonna sell some of my famous cookies, to these Hollywood types, and make a mint!"
2283,2,9,Eric Cartman,What kind of cookies?
2284,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Calm down, tubby."
2285,2,9,Chef,"They're little cookies, with fudge in the middle. And I call them, ""Fudge 'Ems""."
2286,2,9,Eric Cartman,I wanna Fudge 'Em.
2287,2,9,Chef,"I can just see the commercial now. ""Wife got you down? Boss makin' you angry? Kids yellin' atcha? Well, Fudge 'Ems."""
2288,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Cool!
2289,2,9,Chef,"And I've also got my double chocolate cookies, ""Fudge This."""
2290,2,9,Director 3,"[Passing by with his date.] Oh look, one of the natives is selling local food wares... how quaint."
2291,2,9,Woman,"This is why I come to these things, to get away from L.A. and become one with the more simple culture."
2292,2,9,Chef,"Well, perhaps you'd like to try my low-calorie cookies, ""Go Fudge Yourself,"" or my all-natural, ""I Don't Really Give A Flying Fudge."""
2293,2,9,Woman,"Ooh, do you have any tofu or steamed celery?"
2294,2,9,Chef,Huh?
2295,2,9,Director 3,I would kill for some cous cous right now.
2296,2,9,Chef,Whose goose?
2297,2,9,Woman,"Uuuuh, never mind. We brought some food from the Natural Market in L.A."
2298,2,9,Director 3,"Cute sign, though."
2299,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, I have two tickets for the opening film of the festival. Would you like to come with me?"
2300,2,9,Eric Cartman,"[Taunting.] Stan, nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh. Tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh?"
2301,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman! [To Wendy.] Sure, dude. I mean, since we have to write a paper on a film anyway. [They walk away.]"
2302,2,9,Eric Cartman,"She'll be the death of him, Kyle. Mark my words: she'll be the death of him."
2303,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,If she holds his hand in that theater it'll be all over.
2304,2,9,Chef,"Get 'em while they're hot! My all new cookies! ""I Just Went And Fudged Your Momma!"""
2305,2,9,Eric Cartman,"[To Kyle.] Jesus, he sure ran that one into the ground."
2306,2,9,Stan Marsh,When's this thing start? I hope there are some good previews.
2307,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, film festival movies usually don't have previews before them."
2308,2,9,Stan Marsh,They what?!
2309,2,9,Candice Butch,Who are you to judge my womanly soul?
2310,2,9,Candice Butch,The Goddess flames that burn in my memory aren't dark. Dare you call them dark!
2311,2,9,Candice Butch,Here lies the Goddess truth of my body.
2312,2,9,Stan Marsh,"[With soda and popcorn.] Oh, brother."
2313,2,9,Candice Butch,"The Goddess that cries, ""Freedom!"""
2314,2,9,Candice Butch,Here is the Goddess truth of my womanly being
2315,2,9,Candice Butch,"You are my blossom, my flame. When we make love, it's like the sun is right outside the door."
2316,2,9,Candice s Girlfriend,"Then make love to me, right now"
2317,2,9,Stan Marsh,Dude!
2318,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,Sshh!
2319,2,9,Stan Marsh,Dude!
2320,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I can see clearly now, the rain is gone
I can see all obstacles in my way-"
2321,2,9,Sheila,[From the master bedroom.] Bubbeleh you need to get to bed! It's late!
2322,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm poopies, ma!"
2323,2,9,Sheila,"Well, hurry up!"
2324,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Gone are the dark clouds that had me-
2325,2,9,Mr Hankey,"[Voice only, slowly, with echo.] Ky-yle! Ky-yle!"
2326,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Could it be?
2327,2,9,Mr Hankey,[In his shrill voice.] Hooowwwdy ho!
2328,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Hankey? Mr. Hankey, is that you? Hello?"
2329,2,9,Tom Hanks,"I'm here live in South Park, Colorado, where citizens from Los Angeles are arriving in droves for the town's first annual film festival. This is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens, [Softly.] except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town [Normally.] and so the excitement level is naturally very high. Right now, the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of Hollywood's top celebrities."
2330,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It was him, dude. I told you, it was Mr. Hankey!"
2331,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Wait, I thought Mr. Hankey only came at Christmastime."
2332,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I'm sure it was him."
2333,2,9,Man,"Look, look! Here comes somebody!"
2334,2,9,A woman,"Move aside, I can't see."
2335,2,9,Tom Hanks,"Ladies and gentlemen, TV's Fred Savage."
2336,2,9,Crowd,[In disappointment.] AAWWWW!
2337,2,9,Tom Hanks,"Well, I'm sure a real person will show up soon."
2338,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"So how was that movie last night, dude?"
2339,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Aw, dude, you don't even wanna know!"
2340,2,9,Eric Cartman,"It had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding, huh?"
2341,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, pretty much."
2342,2,9,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
2343,2,9,Stan Marsh,"The theater sucks, though. They need to get a bigger screen."
2344,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe they should project the movies on Cartman's ass.
2345,2,9,Eric Cartman,Ay!
2346,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, now that'd be like IMAX."
2347,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that's enough fat-ass jokes for this week."
2348,2,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Cartman's ass is so fuckin' huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room, heheheheheh.)"
2349,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm going home."
2350,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well?
2351,2,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna, just give me a minute."
2352,2,9,Robert Redford,"This is perfect. Why didn't we think of it sooner? This town still has some charm left, not the mess we turned Park City into."
2353,2,9,Phyllis,"Forgive me for being observant, but, won't we just end up doing the same thing to this town?"
2354,2,9,Robert Redford,"Yes. And the town after, and the town after that. Like termites, we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up. And then move on, until every quiet mountain town is like Los Angeles."
2355,2,9,Phyllis,Why? Why would we do such a thing?
2356,2,9,Robert Redford,"Because we have to live in L.A. And if we can't live in quiet, simple, peaceful mountain towns, then nobody will!"
2357,2,9,Robert Redford,Waitwaitwait. Zoom in to a close-up of my face when I do that. Ready? Then NOBODY will!
2358,2,9,Robert Redford,That's it.
2359,2,9,Chef,"Children! I'm glad you're here! I want you to check out my new confectioneries. I think they're going to sell right through the roof! I call them, ""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls."""
2360,2,9,Stan Marsh,Are they good?
2361,2,9,Chef,Try 'em.
2362,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey, dude, these are good!"
2363,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I love these Salty Chocolate Balls, Chef."
2364,2,9,Mr Hankey,[From under the runoff grate.] Ky-yle!
2365,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,There it is again!
2366,2,9,Stan Marsh,There is what again?
2367,2,9,Mr Hankey,[Moaning.] Ky-yle!
2368,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's Mr. Hankey! I think he's in some kind of trouble.
2369,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, how do you tell if a piece of poo is in trouble?"
2370,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where does that grill go?
2371,2,9,Stan Marsh,"To the sewer, dude."
2372,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Of course, the sewer! That must be where he is. Come on!"
2373,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Come on!
2374,2,9,Chef,"Hey, everybody,
have you seen my balls?
They're big and salty and brown
If you ever need a quick pick-me-up,
just stick my balls in your mouth
Ooooo, suck on my cho-colate salty balls
put 'em in your mouth
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em and suck 'em..."
2375,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Aw, man, smells like ass down here."
2376,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Of course it smells like ass, retard. It's a sewer!"
2377,2,9,Stan Marsh,What was that?
2378,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Aw, man, let's get out of here!"
2379,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"We can't, dude. Not until we find Mr. Hankey."
2380,2,9,The boys,Aaaaah!
2381,2,9,Kenny McCormick,(Wait!)
2382,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell?
2383,2,9,Stan Marsh,Mr. Garrison?
2384,2,9,Mr Garrison,"Oh uh- hello, children."
2385,2,9,Eric Cartman,What are you doing down in the sewer with a bunch of snorkel stuff on?
2386,2,9,Mr Garrison,Oh I- I was just-uh hangin' out.
2387,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,In a sewer?
2388,2,9,Mr Garrison,"Children, do you know how to file a police report?"
2389,2,9,The boys,No.
2390,2,9,Mr Garrison,Good. See you in school.
2391,2,9,Eric Cartman,"This is ridiculous! What the hell are we, the Goonies?"
2392,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we're the Goonies, Cartman. Why don't you pretend like you're the fat kid?"
2393,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, that does it. Screw you guys, I'm home."
2394,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey!
2395,2,9,Mr Hankey,"Howdy-ho, boys."
2396,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,I told you guys he'd be here!
2397,2,9,Mr Hankey,"Gosh, look at yuh. You're all growin' up sho fasht."
2398,2,9,Eric Cartman,"[Displeased.] Hi, Mr. Hankey. Nice to see yuh."
2399,2,9,Mr Hankey,Have you all been brushing behind your teeth?
2400,2,9,The boys,Yes.
2401,2,9,Mr Hankey,And usin' dental floss?
2402,2,9,The boys,Yes.
2403,2,9,Mr Hankey,And washin' behind your ears?
2404,2,9,The boys,Yes.
2405,2,9,Eric Cartman,No.
2406,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"What's the matter, Mr. Hankey? Are you sick?"
2407,2,9,Mr Hankey,"Oh, I just got a little cold is all. All these new people in South Park are stressful on my home."
2408,2,9,Stan Marsh,What do you mean?
2409,2,9,Mr Hankey,"Well, you see, boys, the sewer is a fragile ecosystem."
2410,2,9,Eric Cartman,[Incredulous.] Oh my God.
2411,2,9,Mr Hankey,"These new folks in town eat nothin' but cous cous, tofu, and raw vegetables, and it's destroying my environment."
2412,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,And that's why you got a cold?
2413,2,9,Mr Hankey,"That's why, Kyle. That's why."
2414,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, why don't you just ask them to leave?"
2415,2,9,Mr Hankey,"There's only one time of year I can come to the surface, and that's Christmastime. That's why I need you boys to go for me."
2416,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't worry, Mr. Hankey. We'll go tell everyone. Come on, guys."
2417,2,9,Mr Hankey,Don't forget to change your sheets once a week!
2418,2,9,Host,"So without further ado we will begin this amazing film. It's a work of blood, sweat, and tears."
2419,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[Rushing in.] Wait! Stop! Could I have your attention, please?"
2420,2,9,Director 4,Is that Leonardo DiCaprio?
2421,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Aaahh!
2422,2,9,Director 4,"Ohuh no, wait, that's not him."
2423,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Ladies and gentlemen, my best friend, Mr. Hankey, is getting sick because South Park has become overcrowded with people who eat health food."
2424,2,9,Female director,"Excuse me, little boy, what's a ""Mr. Hankey""?"
2425,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"He's a talking piece of poo that lives in the sewer. But now he's getting sick because his egosystem is all out of whack because of all the extra poo in the sewer. If you don't all leave and go home soon, Mr. Hankey's gonna die. He's one of my best friends in the whole wide world, and I don't want him to die."
2426,2,9,Director 3,What a great story-it has everything!
2427,2,9,Female director,This could be the next Free Willy.
2428,2,9,Director 5,"Great pic, son. How much do you want for it?"
2429,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Huh??
2430,2,9,Director 6,Does it-uh have to be a talking piece of poo?
2431,2,9,Director 7,It could be a crime-fighting rabbit. Or a lovable turtle.
2432,2,9,Director 4,This could be a great summer movie.
2433,2,9,Female director 2,[Rising in the back.] Can we put a mon-key in it?
2434,2,9,Director 8,"""The Mr. Hankey Stor-"" uh is Harrison Ford available for a fall pic?"
2435,2,9,Director 9,Keanu Reeves.
2436,2,9,Director 1,Matt Damon!
2437,2,9,Fred Savage,Fred Savage!
2438,2,9,Director 7,I'd pay a million for this story!
2439,2,9,Director 1,I'll pay two.
2440,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, no one even listened to me."
2441,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Well um, it does sound like a pretty sweet movie."
2442,2,9,Director 3,"Mmuh I take it you're part owner of this whole Mr. Hooey story, right?"
2443,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Uhuh, yeah, I guess."
2444,2,9,Director 3,I want you to do a big-money deal with me.
2445,2,9,Eric Cartman,All of us?
2446,2,9,Director 3,"Mm-we-hell, I can see that you're the real brains of the group. You don't really need those guys, do you?"
2447,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Ye-ah, screw those guys. I don't even like them."
2448,2,9,Director 3,"Hm-that's great, kid. Let's make a deal."
2449,2,9,Robert Redford,"Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for making the First Annual South Park Film Festival a success. We've barely even started and already the festival has seen more attendance than last year's Sundance festival."
2450,2,9,Someone in the crowd,Fantastic!
2451,2,9,Robert Redford,"And I'm very pleased to announce that in honor of the South Park people who have welcomed us, we are going to build a Hollywood Planet restaurant, right here where this library used to stand."
2452,2,9,Crowd,[Gasping.] Ooohhh!
2453,2,9,Aide 2,Can they do that?
2454,2,9,Mayor McDaniels,They're Hollywood! They can do anything!
2455,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey!
2456,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey?!
2457,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Mr. Hankey?
2458,2,9,Mr Hankey,"[Turns around.] Oh, Kyle. Howdy-ho."
2459,2,9,Mr Hankey,"Well, how did it go? Is everyone gonna stop poopin' in my environment?"
2460,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,They didn't believe me. They thought I was pitching a movie.
2461,2,9,Mr Hankey,"[Droops.] Oh. I, I see. Welluh shucks, Kyle, I can't thank you enough for tryin'."
2462,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,[Determined.] We only have one option. I've gotta take you to the surface.
2463,2,9,Mr Hankey,Aw I can't. The sun'll dry me out.
2464,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's the only way to prove to them that you're real.
2465,2,9,Mr Hankey,But I won't last long up above.
2466,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, you're not gonna last down here either, Mr. Hankey. Now, come on! I'm not gonna let you die!"
2467,2,9,Mr Hankey,"All right, just let me get my toothbrush."
2468,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Come on, Stan, we're gonna be late for the screening!"
2469,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Jeez, they made that into a movie already?"
2470,2,9,Tom Hanks,"Mr. Hankey, I can't go on anymore. I've lost the fight."
2471,2,9,Mr Hankey,"[A talking monkey hanging from the curtain.] No, I'm not leaving without you."
2472,2,9,Mr Hankey,"We started this together, we're gonna finish it together."
2473,2,9,Tom Hanks,"I always thought death was something glorious, but now I know that it's not."
2474,2,9,Director 3,[Sitting in the back with Cartman.] It's going over really well. People are gonna be knocking my door down to get you.
2475,2,9,Eric Cartman,Who the hell cast Tom Hanks in this?! Tom Hanks can't act his way out of a nutsack!
2476,2,9,Tom Hanks,"[Onscreen.] I'll always love you, Mr. Hankey."
2477,2,9,Eric Cartman,"[Mocking.] I'll momaymumyeu, Meemuhmammy."
2478,2,9,Man 1,"Oh my God, I found a penny! [Picks it up.]"
2479,2,9,Man 2,You bastard!
2480,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mph. Okay, Mr. Hankey. We're out. How are you doin'?"
2481,2,9,Mr Hankey,[Looking more frozen than dry.] It sure is -dry up here. [Coughs]
2482,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't worry. We'll do this quick, okay? Just hang on, Mr. Hankey, just hang on!"
2483,2,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Excuse me, Mr. Film Commissioner, could I have a word with you?"
2484,2,9,Robert Redford,[Arms crossed.] Make it quick.
2485,2,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, the people of my town are a little upset. I don't think we realized what an impact this festival would have on our town."
2486,2,9,Robert Redford,Uh-huh.
2487,2,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Right. So, we were actually wondering if we could call this whole thing off?"
2488,2,9,Robert Redford,"We have contracts. [He pulls some out.] You try to pull out now, we'll sue your little town for every penny it's got. But thanks so much for the hard work."
2489,2,9,Eric Cartman,"[With director 3.] Eh but, but this doesn't make sense to me, Marty! Okay, you told me the movie made a lot of money!"
2490,2,9,Marty,"Mmp right. Two million, minus your agent's fee, minus your lawyer's fee, minus my fee, and the publicity and taxes taken out, you get three dollars! That's more than most people in your position make, trust me!"
2491,2,9,Stan Marsh,"[Happening upon the scene.] Serves you right, Cartman! You're a sellout!"
2492,2,9,Eric Cartman,I'm not a sellout! What's a sellout?
2493,2,9,Stan Marsh,"If you work in the entertainment business and you make money, you're a sellout!"
2494,2,9,Chef,"[Stopping by.] It's all gone to hell, children. And we're all to blame. Even me!"
2495,2,9,Chef,"I was sellin' out my town, too! And now look at it."
2496,2,9,Stan Marsh,So what do we do now?
2497,2,9,Chef,There's nothin' we can do. Just sit here and suck on my balls.
2498,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, we have to hurry!"
2499,2,9,Stan Marsh,Why?
2500,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Come on! Everything's gonna be okay!
2501,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Sir! Sir!
2502,2,9,Robert Redford,Not now!
2503,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,I have to show you something.
2504,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,I think it will change the way you feel about your impact here.
2505,2,9,A director,What's this?
2506,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,I want you guys to all meet my friend.
2507,2,9,Robert Redford,"That's great, kid. A dried-out lump of shit; very compelling. [To the crowd] Okay, folks, let's move! We've gotta have that sign down in time for the opening tonight!"
2508,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't die, Mr. Hankey. You can't."
2509,2,9,Mr Hankey,Kyle. Be-fore I go there's something I must tell you. Come clo-ser.
2510,2,9,Mr Hankey,Clo-ser.
2511,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Well-. Huwhat is it, Mr. Hankey?"
2512,2,9,Mr Hankey,There is a-nother Sky-walk-er.
2513,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Nooohohohohohoho-
2514,2,9,Mr Hankey,Wake up.
2515,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"What is it, Mr. Hankey?"
2516,2,9,Mr Hankey,Come clo-ser.
2517,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,What is it?
2518,2,9,Mr Hankey,Clo-ser.
2519,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yes?
2520,2,9,Mr Hankey,Closer!
2521,2,9,Mr Hankey,"One time, when you were sleeping, I put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture."
2522,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Nooo!
2523,2,9,Voice over,"[Singing slowly, mournfully.]
Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo.
He loved me, I loved you.
Therefore vicariously he loved you-"
2524,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Nooo!
2525,2,9,HazMat official,"I'm sorry, son. Let's get him to ICU."
2526,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,[Weeping.] Noo! No!
2527,2,9,Stan Marsh,"[Concerned.] Are you gonna be okay, dude? I'm here for you."
2528,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,"[Arriving.] Hi, Stan. Ready to go see another movie? [Damn.]"
2529,2,9,Stan Marsh,Okay!
2530,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Uuf.
2531,2,9,Cowboy,"Say, Tom. Do you have any pudding left?"
2532,2,9,Tom Hanks,"I ate all mine up, silly."
2533,2,9,Cowboy,"Well then, now what do we do?"
2534,2,9,Man,AAWWWW!
2535,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,Eeewww!
2536,2,9,Man,[Facing Stan.] Hey!
2537,2,9,Stan Marsh,Sorry.
2538,2,9,Cowboy,"Well, why don't we just explore our sexuality?"
2539,2,9,Tom Hanks,"Ooh, good idea. Let's."
2540,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Aw, dude, I shouldn't be seeing this!"
2541,2,9,Stan Marsh,Blaach!
2542,2,9,Man,"Aaww! [Turns around to face Stan.] Is there a problem, young man?"
2543,2,9,Stan Marsh,"No problem, dude."
2544,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'll never forget you. You were my best friend after Stan.
2545,2,9,Chef,"Come on, Kyle. It's time to go."
2546,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, does poo go to heaven?"
2547,2,9,Chef,"[Chef ponders a moment.] Well, uh-I kinda hope not."
2548,2,9,Chef,"I mean, sure it does."
2549,2,9,Chef,Here. I'll give him one of my Salty Balls to take with him to poo heaven.
2550,2,9,Chef,"Come on, let's go."
2551,2,9,Mr Hankey,[Weakly.] Kyle.
2552,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,[Rushes back.] Mr. Hankey?
2553,2,9,Mr Hankey,Howdy-ho.
2554,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,He's back! He's back! [Chef returns.]
2555,2,9,Mr Hankey,That was delicious.
2556,2,9,Chef,My Salty Chocolate Balls must have re-juvenated him!
2557,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You've got the best balls in the whole world, Chef."
2558,2,9,Chef,You're daaamn right.
2559,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Step on up, get them here! Mr. Hankey & Me T-shirts! Get them while they last, folks. for only $14.95!"
2560,2,9,Woman,I'll take two.
2561,2,9,Man,I'd like to pay for one.
2562,2,9,Eric Cartman,Selling T-shirts kicks ass!
2563,2,9,Robert Redford,"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased to announce on this Gala Opening of Hollywood Planet South Park, that the festival will be back next year!"
2564,2,9,Robert Redford,"And the year after that, and the year after that, and so on! And now, release the curtain!"
2565,2,9,Robert Redford,"I give you, ""Hollywood in South Park!"""
2566,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Wait!
2567,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,I brought him! I brought him to show you!
2568,2,9,Robert Redford,"[Put off.] Oh, not this again!"
2569,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,Behold! Mr. Hankey!
2570,2,9,Mr Hankey,Hoooooowwwdy-ho!
2571,2,9,Robert Redford,"Anyway, this new Hollywood Planet will be the official meeting place for all-"
2572,2,9,Mr Hankey,"Howdy-ho, folks. I'm afraid my buddy Kyle was right. There's not enough room in South Park to accommodate a festival."
2573,2,9,Short Man,"Mr. Poo, if you wouldn't mind, we can't hear our chairman. If you could just turn yourself down. You're at about 7 right now, we need you at about, 3, okay?"
2574,2,9,Mr Hankey,"Uh, folks, please. Little towns like this simply aren't made for friggin' films. We love havin' visitors, but golly, too many of you is hurtin' our ecosystem. Be-sides, folks, film festivals shouldn't be about what celebrities are comin' or what film is gonna get sold. It should be about people gettin' together, and watchin' movies, and about people who could never get their movies seen havin' a chance to have it watched, if only once. A good film festival should be something where we all say, ""Gaw, let's forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities. Let's forget all those things for just a while, and just watch some new art."""
2575,2,9,Robert Redford,[Grabs Mr. Hankey and pulls back.] I have had enough of you! [He tosses him away.]
2576,2,9,Mr Hankey,[Flying through the air.] Nyyaarrrr!
2577,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,No!
2578,2,9,Robert Redford,"Now, as I was saying, this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals."
2579,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,[Crying.] O-hoho he's dead. Mr. Hankey's dead.
2580,2,9,Chef,"Well, it worked once before."
2581,2,9,Mr Hankey,"[Recovering.] Hi, Chef. Your big chocolate balls are just the trick!"
2582,2,9,Stan Marsh,What the hell is he doing?
2583,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
2584,2,9,Eric Cartman,Whoa!
2585,2,9,An Agent,Oh my God!
2586,2,9,Crowd Members,[Fleeing.] Aaaaahh!
2587,2,9,Man,"Oh, my God, it's crap!"
2588,2,9,Man 2,Ohh! Noo!
2589,2,9,Man 3,"Whoa, it smells, it smells!"
2590,2,9,Phyllis,"[Now inside.] Come on, let's go! It's coming!"
2591,2,9,Robert Redford,"[With key in the ignition.] I'm trying, damn it!"
2592,2,9,Robert Redford,Aww. Aww. Glup.
2593,2,9,Man,Let's get out of this town!
2594,2,9,Mr Hankey,[Gazing at the scene.] Gosh. I guess I don't know my own strength.
2595,2,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You did it, Mr. Hankey. You got rid of all the film people!"
2596,2,9,Townsfolk,Hooray!
2597,2,9,Mayor McDaniels,"Ooh, yeaah. Now all we have is a town covered in shit! This is much better!"
2598,2,9,Mr Hankey,"I couldn't have done it without you, Kyle."
2599,2,9,Mr Hankey,Kisses.
2600,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,"[Stopping by.] Stan, I'm sorry I dragged you to all those independent films."
2601,2,9,Stan Marsh,"Oh, that's okay Wendy. I forgive you."
2602,2,9,Wendy Testaburger,"Sometimes I forget that even though a few independent films are great, most of them suck ass."
2603,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Yes. And I've learned something, too."
2604,2,9,Eric Cartman,"Being a sellout is sweet. Because you make a lot of money. And when you have money, you don't have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys. Screw you guys, I'ma goin' home."
2605,2,10,Dr Doctor,It's a good thing we got her to the hospital in time.
2606,2,10,Sharon Marsh,But what's wrong with her?
2607,2,10,Dr Doctor,"It's chickenpox. There seems to be a small epidemic going around. Your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child, I take it?"
2608,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"No, no, she's been perfectly healthy."
2609,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Well, that's the problem. You see, chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children, but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease."
2610,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Sweetly.] Shelly, look who's come to visit you; your little brother, Stan."
2611,2,10,Shelly Marsh,"[In disgust.] Oh, whoo-peee!"
2612,2,10,Dr Doctor,"You know, most people don't realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes."
2613,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you've got herpes on your face!"
2614,2,10,Shelly Marsh,"Shut up, brat!"
2615,2,10,Sharon Marsh,[With some urgency.] Will my daughter be okay?
2616,2,10,Dr Doctor,She'll be fine.
2617,2,10,Shelly Marsh,[Stan scratches her cheek.] Stop it!
2618,2,10,Dr Doctor,We just want to be cautious and monitor her here.
2619,2,10,Stan Marsh,Ow!
2620,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Come on, Stanley. Give your sister a kiss and then we have to go."
2621,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"...and then the doctor said that it's much worse as you get older. My daughter is in pretty bad shape now, but if she were in her twenties, she could die."
2622,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"My God, I never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness."
2623,2,10,Liane Cartman,I guess it's much better to get it when you're young.
2624,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"So tell me if I'm crazy, but I started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox. Let them get it now, while they're young."
2625,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"That's not crazy at all, Sharon. Mothers do it all the time."
2626,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Oh, yes. When I was a child, my mother had me go over to a little girl's house who had the chickenpox, just so I would get it."
2627,2,10,Sharon Marsh,So it's not such a crazy idea after all?
2628,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Noo, no. And I'm pretty sure that strange little boy Kenny has the chickenpox right now."
2629,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Are you guys having a meeting or something?
2630,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,How would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend Kenny's house tonight?
2631,2,10,Eric Cartman,"No way, dude. Kenny's family's poor; they live in the ghetto."
2632,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Let's just have a slumber party here.
2633,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Boys, you're going to sleep over at Kenny's, and that's final."
2634,2,10,Eric Cartman,Oh weak!
2635,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,I wonder why our moms want us to sleep over at Kenny's so bad.
2636,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's pretty weird."
2637,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, all I can say is, he's better have Nintendo."
2638,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, here's Kenny's house."
2639,2,10,Eric Cartman,"In the ghetto
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto... In the ghetto"
2640,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Yeah?
2641,2,10,Stan Marsh,We're here to have a slumber party with Kenny.
2642,2,10,Stuart McCormick,What? Don't you know Kenny's sick with--?
2643,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"[Intruding.] That's the whole point, remember? Their moms want them to catch it while they're young."
2644,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Oh yeah.
2645,2,10,Stan Marsh,Catch what?
2646,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Nothin'. Uhco-uh, come on in, I was jus' makin' dinner."
2647,2,10,Eric Cartman,"And his momma cried
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
Is another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto In the ghetto"
2648,2,10,Stan Marsh,Sshh! Cartman!
2649,2,10,Eric Cartman,What?
2650,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"[Setting the table.] Kenny, your little friends are here! Come play with them!"
2651,2,10,Kenny McCormick,"(No, Mom, I'm seriously sick!)"
2652,2,10,Mrs McCormick,I know you're sick! Now get your buns out here!
2653,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Heheheh, buns."
2654,2,10,Kenny McCormick,"[Walks up to the other boys.] (Hey you guys, what's goin' on?)"
2655,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude! You've got herpes on your face, too!"
2656,2,10,Eric Cartman,[Scanning the room.] Where is the Nintendo?
2657,2,10,Stuart McCormick,We don't have a Nintendo. We got a ColecoVision hooked up to the black-and-white TV.
2658,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God. This is like a third-world country.
2659,2,10,Mrs McCormick,[Now finished setting table.] Throw your sleeping bags in Kenny's room and then come grab some dinner.
2660,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, good. I'm starving."
2661,2,10,Mrs McCormick,Let's say grace.
2662,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"Lord, we thank you for this staggering payload of frozen waffles you have bestowed upon us. And since we have been faithful to you, we know that you will send us some good fortune one of these days, even though you sure as hell seem to be taking your sweet time. Amen."
2663,2,10,All,Amen.
2664,2,10,Eric Cartman,Pfff..!
2665,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Okay, let's dig in."
2666,2,10,Kevin McCormick,"That one's mine, that one's mine!"
2667,2,10,Eric Cartman,[Coolly.] What kind of side dishes will we be enjoying this evening with our frozen waffles?
2668,2,10,Eric Cartman,Am I to understand there will be no side dishes?
2669,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"So, Kyle, your dad's still bringing home those big, fat lawyer paychecks?"
2670,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
2671,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Stuart, don't even get started!"
2672,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"[To his wife.] What? I'm just askin' a question. [To Kyle.] You know, your dad and I used to be best friends when we were teenagers. We would work together at Pizza Shack. But he got promoted and went off to community college and I didn't. And you know why? 'Cause your dad's Jewish!"
2673,2,10,Eric Cartman,Puh! I heard that.
2674,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"That ain't why, Stuart! [Sadness creeps into her voice.] It's because you are an alcoholic retard and he had dreams of not eating frozen waffles for dinner every night!"
2675,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"Hey, is it my fault you don't know how to cook?!"
2676,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"What am I supposed to do with frozen waffles, clamhead?! You put 'em in the toaster and you cook 'em!"
2677,2,10,Stuart McCormick,You just don't know how to use spices and stuff.
2678,2,10,Kevin McCormick,"[Gleefully.] My waffle's d-hun, my waffle's d-hu-hun!"
2679,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Now Kevin, we ain't got enough for everybody. You have to split that with your brother."
2680,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Jesus, are you fucking kidding me?"
2681,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"Hey! We don't say ""fuck"" at the table, you little asshole!"
2682,2,10,Eric Cartman,"[Hushed.] Heh, we apparently don't say 'side dishes' at the table, either."
2683,2,10,Kenny McCormick,(Aa-choo!)
2684,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, honey, if you're going to sneeze, sneeze on them."
2685,2,10,Stan Marsh,Huh?
2686,2,10,Kenny McCormick,[Turning towards Cartman.] (Waa-choo!)
2687,2,10,Eric Cartman,[Recoiling.] Ey!
2688,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Man, your family sucks ass, Kenny. Whoever heard of frozen waffles for dinner?"
2689,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Come on! Let's just get in our sleeping bags and get this night over with.
2690,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what the hell is that?"
2691,2,10,Eric Cartman,It's my Urkel sleeping bag. Isn't it coool?
2692,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's not cool!"
2693,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I think I just saw a rat!"
2694,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Argh! You have rats in your house, too, Kenny?!"
2695,2,10,Kenny McCormick,(Uh-huh.)
2696,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Dude, seriously, you'd better stop being so poor, or else I'm gonna start huckin' rocks atcha."
2697,2,10,Stan Marsh,I don't think it's very healthy to sleep with rats.
2698,2,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, there's gonna be a bunch of rats until they put the freakin' ceiling in.)"
2699,2,10,Stan Marsh,Oh.
2700,2,10,Kenny McCormick,(Aa-choo!)
2701,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, lemme see."
2702,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, goody! You've got a fever!"
2703,2,10,Stan Marsh,"[Mad.] Goody? What do you mean, ""goody""?!"
2704,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Yyup, it looks like you've got chickenpox alright."
2705,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Chickenpo--? Oh no, I must have caught it from Kenny last night."
2706,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, gee, I guess you did."
2707,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, you sure seem happy about it!"
2708,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"All right, it's off to bed with you, young man."
2709,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Don't scratch it, hon."
2710,2,10,Eric Cartman,"[Whining.] But mom, seriously, it itches. I can't stand it!"
2711,2,10,Liane Cartman,"No, hon."
2712,2,10,Eric Cartman,"[Whining.] Mom, seriously, it itches. It itches!"
2713,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Here, I got you some calamine lotion."
2714,2,10,Eric Cartman,I don't wanna.
2715,2,10,Liane Cartman,It'll make your itches go away.
2716,2,10,Eric Cartman,Ugh. Uunnh.
2717,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Ey, give me that!"
2718,2,10,Eric Cartman,Ahhhh...
2719,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Not too much, hon. It says on the bottle that too much can be bad."
2720,2,10,Eric Cartman,More calamine lotion!
2721,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,I don't understand it. He's perfectly healthy.
2722,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I feel great!
2723,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Are you sure you stayed over at Kenny's house?
2724,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. I told you, we had bread sandwiches for breakfast."
2725,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Did you sleep in the same room?
2726,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. Why?
2727,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Bubbe, how would you like to spend the night at your friend Kenny's house again?"
2728,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No way, dude! It sucked ass! They don't even have cable!"
2729,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Well I think you need to spend more time with your friends.
2730,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny's not really my friend, Ma. I don't give a rat's ass about him."
2731,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,I'm gonna give Mrs. McCormick a call.
2732,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Aawwww! Hey Dad. Is it true that you and Kenny's dad used to be best friends when you were young?
2733,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Who? Stuart? Yeah, yeah, I guess we were."
2734,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well how come Kenny's family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor, and we have a big house and lots of food?"
2735,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, because Kenny's family doesn't have as much money as we do."
2736,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"But why? If they're hungry and poor, why don't we just always give them half of our food?"
2737,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Ha ha ha ha ha! Ooh-ho boy, have you got a lot to learn! Sit down, son."
2738,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"You see, Kyle, we humans work as a society, and in order for a society to thrive, we need gods, and clods."
2739,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Gods and clods?
2740,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yes. You see, I spent a lot of time going to law school, and I was able to go because I have a slightly higher intellect than others. But I still need people to pump my gas, and make my French fries, and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down."
2741,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Oooohh, I see. Gods and clods!"
2742,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"That's right. So Kenny's family is happy just the way they are, and we're all a functioning part of America."
2743,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Enters.] Stanley, can I get you anything else?"
2744,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley? Oh my God! Randy?! Randy, hurry, he's burning up!"
2745,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Don't you worry, Stanley, you're going to be okay."
2746,2,10,Dr Doctor,[Entering.] Can I talk to you outside?
2747,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Kids, Daddy and I are gonna be right back, okay?"
2748,2,10,Stan Marsh,Okay.
2749,2,10,Shelly Marsh,"[Now that they're alone.] Serves you right, you little brat!"
2750,2,10,Stan Marsh,Well at least I'm not gonna die from it like you might! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
2751,2,10,Shelly Marsh,"If I die from this, I'm taking you with me!"
2752,2,10,TV Voice,"[""Passion Cramps""] Will Carol find out she's a fa..."
2753,2,10,Stan Marsh,I don't wanna watch this! I wanna watch Terrance and Phillip!
2754,2,10,Shelly Marsh,[Threatening] We're watching this!
2755,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Well I've got the remote, bitch! Hahaha. [Click.]"
2756,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Say, Terrance? Will you check my ass for abnormalities?"
2757,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Sure thing, Phillip."
2758,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Ah ha ha ha, you got me again!"
2759,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,That's tomfoolery.
2760,2,10,Shelly Marsh,Give me the remote!
2761,2,10,Stan Marsh,"No way, dude! We're gonna watch Terrance and Phillip all day--"
2762,2,10,Stan Marsh,Ey! Get me out of here!
2763,2,10,TV Voice,"[""Passion Cramps""] She was..."
2764,2,10,Dr Doctor,"He'll be okay, but it's a good idea for us to monitor him for a while."
2765,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Anxious.] Oh God, what have we done?"
2766,2,10,Dr Doctor,"There there now, it's not your fault."
2767,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Doctor, we-uuuh purposefully sent our son to stay with a friend who had chickenpox so that he would get it early."
2768,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Oh, wow, you did? Wow. You guys suck."
2769,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Could we go home now, Ma?"
2770,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No, bubbeleh. You play with Kenny some more."
2771,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,But we've been playing for eight hours. We can't think of anything else to do.
2772,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"I've got a great game for you. It's called ""ookie mouth""."
2773,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What's ""ookie mouth""?"
2774,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"First, you let Kenny spit in your mouth. Then you try to swallow his spit and say ""ookie mouth"" at the same time."
2775,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Sick, dude!"
2776,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No, no, bubbe, it's loads of fun. Try it."
2777,2,10,Shiela,That ought to take care of it.
2778,2,10,Mrs McCormick,You want some more hot water?
2779,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, no thank you. It's terrific though, it's-- You don't have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water, do you?"
2780,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Naw, we don't go for that hoity-toity rich folk stuff."
2781,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"I see. Well, you certainly have aab- humble home, Mrs. McCormick."
2782,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Yehah, well, unfortunately my husband is a washed-up hunk of shit!"
2783,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."
2784,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Ookie mouth! [Kenny spits in.] Gross! I can't do it, Ma!"
2785,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Try again, bubbe!"
2786,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Argh!
2787,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"You know, your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers."
2788,2,10,Mrs McCormick,Oh they wuz best friends; you couldn't separate 'em.
2789,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Really? I met Gerald in college, so I didn't know. What happened to them?"
2790,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Oh they jus' grew apart, I guess. I think Stuart's a little jealous that your husband got out of makin' pizzas and went on to make somethin' of hisself."
2791,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Well that's too bad. I'm sure your husband's a fine man.
2792,2,10,Mrs McCormick,"Oh, hell no! He's a nugget o' deer turd."
2793,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,But if they were such good friends it seems silly that they don't even talk anymore. Let's get them together!
2794,2,10,Mrs McCormick,Uh-I don't know.
2795,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,We'll just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something.
2796,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't say ""ookie mouth"" and have Kenny spit down my throat at the same time. It's impossible."
2797,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Practice makes perfect, bubbe."
2798,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Dammit, where's that calamine lotion?!"
2799,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"[With clipboard.] Phillip, I've got good news, and bad news."
2800,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Give it to me straight, Terrance."
2801,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"The good news is, you have a clean bill of health."
2802,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Oh, what a relief!"
2803,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"The bad news is, you have cancer."
2804,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Cancer?
2805,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Yes. I'm afraid your ass is collapsing.
2806,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,My ass is collapsing?
2807,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Yes. See this X-ray? [Turns it on.] That's your ass. See this line? [Points to it.] That's your ass collapsing. Your ass is collapsing.
2808,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Will this mean that I won't be able to fart anymore?
2809,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"No, it means that you won't be able to live anymore."
2810,2,10,Eric Cartman,"[Somber.] Oh, no. [The itching returns.] Damnit!"
2811,2,10,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty! That's a-- Wait a minute. Come 'ere, Kitty!"
2812,2,10,Eric Cartman,Uh. Yes. Uh...
2813,2,10,Liane Cartman,"[Closing a door.] I'm back, hon. I got some more calamine lotion."
2814,2,10,Eric Cartman,[Releases Mr. Kitty.] It's about friggin' time! Give me that!
2815,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Just use a little bit of that stuff, hon. It has to last a while."
2816,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Uugh! Yeessss. [His voice trails off.] Ooohhh yyou guys, seriiously, it calms yer ass. Ahhhh..."
2817,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"I didn't know you like to fish, Gerry."
2818,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, yeah, love it! I haven't done it for a while, though. I had to go out and buy a few things, you know a-. A rod and a reel and an uh, uuh..."
2819,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Tackle box?
2820,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, tackle box. [Stretches.] Man, smell that mountain air. What a great Saturday morning; aren't weekends just the best?"
2821,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"When you're uh-unemployed, weekends are meaningless."
2822,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Right. Right-right.
2823,2,10,Mr Garrison,"And so, children, that's how you tell a prostitute from a policeman. Now, are there any questions?"
2824,2,10,Mr Garrison,"Yes, Kyle?"
2825,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell does that have to do with American history?
2826,2,10,Mr Garrison,"Uh, that's a good question, Kyle. Are there any other questions?"
2827,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, I'm the only one here. Everyone else has chicken herpes."
2828,2,10,Mr Garrison,"Right, right. Uhh... Well, class, I'm going to assign you all a paper. The theme of the paper will be, ""How I would make America better."""
2829,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! Does everybody have to do it, or just me?"
2830,2,10,Mr Garrison,"Uh, don't worry, Kyle. I'm sending homework to all the children who are out sick. They'll have to turn in a paper, too."
2831,2,10,Stan Marsh,Homework?! But I'm in the hospital!
2832,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Well, your teacher sent this stuff over for you to do while you're sick."
2833,2,10,Stan Marsh,That son of a bitch! What kind of sick weirdo is he?
2834,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Stanley, I know at your age teachers can seem cold and heartless, but later, you'll understand that he did this for your own good."
2835,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Not Mr. Garrison, Ma. He really is a sick weirdo."
2836,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it's-it's true, he is."
2837,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oh. Well, anyway, here's a pencil and some paper."
2838,2,10,Stan Marsh,Wait! Where are you going?
2839,2,10,Randy Marsh,We're going down to-uhh Happy Burger for some milkshakes.
2840,2,10,Stan Marsh,Milkshakes?!
2841,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, and then we're going to the movies."
2842,2,10,Randy Marsh,"See ya, son. [They leave.]"
2843,2,10,Stan Marsh,Weak!
2844,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"""So this is how America works. We have gods and clods. My dad says America needs both rich and poor to survive, but I have a better idea."""
2845,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No I don't understand it, Dr. Schwartz, he's perfectly healthy."
2846,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,He's been over at Kenny's house three days in a row and still hasn't caught the chickenpox.
2847,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Softly.] What?
2848,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"I don't know what else to do. We sent the other boys over and they all got sick, but I can't get my little Kyle to catch it."
2849,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Frightened.] Oh my God!
2850,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Turns.] Kyle, what are you doing there, honey?"
2851,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Angry.] You!
2852,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Subdued.] I'll call you back, Dr. Schwartz."
2853,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,You!
2854,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Walks over.] What, bubbeleh, what is it?"
2855,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,You sent us over to Kenny's house on purpose! You wanted us to get sick!
2856,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Oy. It was for your own good, Kyle. I wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young."
2857,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Why?! So I could be sitting in the hospital waiting to die, like Stan?!"
2858,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Now, Kyle, come here."
2859,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You get away from me, you crazy woman!"
2860,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Hoh boy.
2861,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Beer?
2862,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Huh? Oh, uh, no thanks, I brought my own. Microbrew sampler from Aspen. Has six different beers from local breweries."
2863,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Sahay, remember that time we built the fort in your mom's back yard?"
2864,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Hu hu hu hu heh yeah. It took us damn near two years to finish it.
2865,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Hahah. Whatever happened to that old hunk o' junk? Haha--
2866,2,10,Stuart McCormick,[Soberly.] That's where I live now.
2867,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, right."
2868,2,10,Stan Marsh,And so that's why Knight Rider was the best show in America.
2869,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,[Rushing in.] Stan! Stan!
2870,2,10,Stan Marsh,[Pointing to Shelly.] Sshh. Wake her up and we're both dead.
2871,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[Softly.] Sorry, sorry. You know how after we spent the night at Kenny's house and-and you and Cartman got sick with chickenpox?"
2872,2,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2873,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Our parents sent us over there to get us sick!
2874,2,10,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about?
2875,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"They knew that staying at Kenny's house would get us sick, and they made us do it anyway."
2876,2,10,Stan Marsh,They did?
2877,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. And I think I figured out why.
2878,2,10,Stan Marsh,Why?
2879,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Because they're a bunch of assholes.
2880,2,10,Stan Marsh,[Long gasp.] Of course!
2881,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dude. We've gotta get out of here. I don't know what they're planning next, but it can't be good!"
2882,2,10,Eric Cartman,"""I hope that one day America could be more like Endor, where the Ewoks live. Endor is very cool."""
2883,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Mom, answer that! ""They have trees and Ewoks, and barbecues, which is why I like Endor more than America. It's cool."""
2884,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, do you remember how we all spent the night at Kenny's a couple of days ago?"
2885,2,10,Eric Cartman,I remember frozen waffles with no side dishes.
2886,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, our parents sent us over there to catch chickenpox from Kenny!"
2887,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. Your mom wanted you to have herpes on your face."
2888,2,10,Eric Cartman,She what?!
2889,2,10,Stan Marsh,It's some kind of parental conspiracy. Our parents are trying to kill us or something.
2890,2,10,Eric Cartman,That bitch! I'm gonna go downstairs and kick her square in the nuts!
2891,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"No-no-no-no. Come on, fatass, we're gonna get 'em all back."
2892,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, I'm sure you'll find another job soon. Something'll come along."
2893,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Not that easy. You were lucky.
2894,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, now-I, I wasn't lucky."
2895,2,10,Stuart McCormick,You had rich parents. You got to go to that expensive community college.
2896,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Hey! I worked my ass off to get to where I am today! [Rising.] I wanted to be somebody!
2897,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"[Rising.] I wanted to be somebody, too! I just wasn't born with a silver enema up my ass!"
2898,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"You're just jealous. You're a bitter old drunk, just like your father!"
2899,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Ow!! [Gets up.]
2900,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Now don't make me do that again!
2901,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Ow! You son of a bitch!
2902,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Uh!
2903,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Ow!
2904,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Oh!
2905,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Ow!
2906,2,10,Stuart McCormick,Eeaagghh!
2907,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,[In pain.] Huuuh!
2908,2,10,Randy Marsh,Doctor?
2909,2,10,Dr Doctor,Yes?
2910,2,10,Randy Marsh,Wh-where's Stan?
2911,2,10,Dr Doctor,Stan?
2912,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Stan, our son?"
2913,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Oh, yes. Where is Stan?"
2914,2,10,Sharon Marsh,You mean Stanley's missing?
2915,2,10,Dr Doctor,"No, no. He's not missing. We just... can't seem to find him at this moment."
2916,2,10,Sharon Marsh,[To Randy.] Oh my God! Our son ran away!
2917,2,10,Randy Marsh,Will he be okay out of the hospital?
2918,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Oh sure, sure. But we have to get him back soon. If he doesn't get his antibiotic shot today, he could die."
2919,2,10,Sharon Marsh,Die?
2920,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Yes, die. It won't be any easy death, either. The chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs."
2921,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Okay, well well, let's go look--"
2922,2,10,Dr Doctor,"As he chokes for breath, the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain, making him think he's David Duchovny."
2923,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Oh God, no!"
2924,2,10,Randy Marsh,I'm-I'm sure he couldn't have gone far.
2925,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably, his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--"
2926,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,So how was it? Did you boys have a good time fishing?
2927,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,That son of a bitch ripped my parka!
2928,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Catch anything?
2929,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,I just don't get it.
2930,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Why would he invite me fishing and then turn into a complete bastard?
2931,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, darling, I have to tell you something. He didn't invite you. I set the whole thing up."
2932,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,What? Now why the hell would you knowingly deceive me like that?
2933,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,I thought it would be good for you.
2934,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Just like you deceived our son into going to Kenny's; and that didn't work either!
2935,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Exasperated, she leaves.] I'm doing the best I can!"
2936,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,What?!
2937,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh, God, what have I done?"
2938,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"What's happening here, Terrance?"
2939,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,We're doing an anal transplant. It's our only hope.
2940,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,Who's the donor?
2941,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"I am, Phillip. I am."
2942,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Terrance, you're giving up your ass for me?"
2943,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Just half my ass. Can you believe it, Phillip? Best friends, and now we're going to share the same ass."
2944,2,10,Chef,"Oh, damn it, not now!"
2945,2,10,Chef,"Damn it! Children, what are you doing here? Terrance and Phillip are about to go into surgery!"
2946,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, we wanna know about herpes."
2947,2,10,Chef,What makes you think I would know anything about that?
2948,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Well I don't know. You're just the only grownup we trust.
2949,2,10,Stan Marsh,How does someone get herpes?
2950,2,10,Chef,Well you get it by sharin' relations with somebody who already has it. You have to be very careful around someone who has herpes.
2951,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Do you know anybody with herpes?
2952,2,10,Chef,"Well, there's old Frida down on Main Street. She has a mouthful of herpes. You need to stay away from her."
2953,2,10,Stan Marsh,But what if we want to give somebody herpes?
2954,2,10,Chef,"Oh, then, Frida's the right person to go to."
2955,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Cool! Thanks, Chef!"
2956,2,10,Chef,O-kay!
2957,2,10,Chef,Wait a minute. What the hell did I just do?
2958,2,10,Sharon Marsh,Stanley?
2959,2,10,Randy Marsh,Stan?
2960,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[Softly.] Oh, Stanley, where are you..?"
2961,2,10,Randy Marsh,Stan?
2962,2,10,Sharon Marsh,Stanley!
2963,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Are you old Frida?
2964,2,10,Frida,[Raspily.] Who wants to know?
2965,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Someone who wants a favor.
2966,2,10,Frida,"Ten dollars a lay, five dollars a b-- [Snorts.]"
2967,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"[To Stan, throws his hands up.] Huh?"
2968,2,10,Eric Cartman,We want you to give our parents herpes.
2969,2,10,Frida,[Puffs out.] Five dollars.
2970,2,10,Stan Marsh,My dad has five dollars on top of his dresser. [Coughs.]
2971,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Damn, you sound pretty sick. Maybe you should go back to the hospital."
2972,2,10,Stan Marsh,"And have Shelly kick my ass? No thanks. Plus, I have to get my parents back just as much as you do."
2973,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Thanks a lot, Frida!"
2974,2,10,Frida,[Hacks.] Don't mention it.
2975,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"D-hude, this is gonna be so killer. They're all gonna get herpes!"
2976,2,10,Boys,Hooray!
2977,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, where the hell have you been?"
2978,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Damn it, Stanley, you had us worried sick! You have to get back to the hospital for a shot!"
2979,2,10,Stan Marsh,[Hiding behind Kyle.] I don't wanna go back there.
2980,2,10,Randy Marsh,"[Coming for him.] Come on, we're taking you back to the hospital."
2981,2,10,Stan Marsh,Don't you guys feel like brushing your teeth first?
2982,2,10,Randy Marsh,What?
2983,2,10,Stan Marsh,"You know, freshen up your breath."
2984,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, man. [Tottering, eyes half shut.] I don't feel so good."
2985,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[Pleased.] Oh good, maybe you finally caught the chicken--"
2986,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh...
2987,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,Kyle!!
2988,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Well, I hope you boys learned your lesson. Going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all."
2989,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,We're sorry.
2990,2,10,Dr Doctor,"Well just be thankful we got you here in time. Your parents are here to see you, I'll send them in."
2991,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,"This itches! Give me some of that calamine lotion, Cartman."
2992,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Hell no, you guys get your own!"
2993,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, how are you feeling today, son?"
2994,2,10,Stan Marsh,Pretty good.
2995,2,10,Sharon Marsh,[Cheerfully.] The doctor says that maybe you can go home tomorrow.
2996,2,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. Isn't that great, Stanley?"
2997,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Wow, coo-hul!"
2998,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,"And how are you, Kyle?"
2999,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,Are you doing okay?
3000,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,I'm better now.
3001,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"What's so funny, you two?"
3002,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,We gave you guys herpes.
3003,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,What-what-whaaat?! You did this?!
3004,2,10,Stan Marsh,We got you back for getting us sick. We had a prostitute use your toothbrushes and stuff.
3005,2,10,Randy Marsh,I can't believe you gave us herpes. You little rascals!
3006,2,10,Sharon Marsh,"[To Randy.] Well, I guess it serves us right. [To the boys.] Kids, we should have honest about wanting you to get chickenpox."
3007,2,10,Sheila Broflovski,It's true. We were wrong for deceiving you about it.
3008,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey, how come you don't have sores on your lips, Ma?"
3009,2,10,Liane Cartman,"Ooh, I have them somewhere else, poopiekins."
3010,2,10,Eric Cartman,Hooray!
3011,2,10,Gerald Broflovski,"And, uh Stuart, I think I owe you an apology. I realize that I shouldn't be so cold towards people that are less fortunate than me."
3012,2,10,Stuart McCormick,"Aww hell, I'm sorry, too."
3013,2,10,Terrance and Phillip,"Oh, Phillip, I'm so glad everything turned out for the better."
3014,2,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, I know one thing for sure."
3015,2,10,Liane Cartman,"What's that, Eric?"
3016,2,10,Eric Cartman,We're all gonna need a lot more calamine lotion.
3017,2,10,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they've killed Kenny!"
3018,2,10,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
3019,2,11,Police Commissioner,"Well, detective. It looks like ya fooled them again."
3020,2,11,Det. Barnaby Jones,"[Now quite old.] All in a day's work, I guess. I just hope that next time, I won't have to run so much."
3021,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, what do you think Barnaby Jones meant when he said, ""This is not a victimless crime""? Anybody?"
3022,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Children, were you paying attention?!"
3023,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, we've been watching Barnaby Jones repeats for eight days now. It's hard to keep paying attention."
3024,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, well excuse me, Kyle! Why don't you just forget what Barnaby Jones has to say?! Why don't you not pay attention to Barnaby Jones and then let's see how far you get in society?! Okay, Stanley, why don't you tell us how Barnaby Jones knew the poison was in the milk?"
3025,2,11,Stan Marsh,Can't we just be like normal third-graders for a little while?
3026,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, and what do you consider normal?!"
3027,2,11,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, like, learn about art 'n music and go on field trips and stuff."
3028,2,11,The Class,Yeah!
3029,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants, it just so happens we are going on a field trip tomorrow!"
3030,2,11,The Class,Hooray!
3031,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,To where?
3032,2,11,Mr Garrison,To the planetarium.
3033,2,11,The Class,AAWWWW!
3034,2,11,Eric Cartman,Planetariums suck!
3035,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh now, what's wrong with the planetarium?"
3036,2,11,Stan Marsh,It's boring.
3037,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, all the constellations look alike."
3038,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, too bad! You're all going to the planetarium tomorrow and you're all going to love it! In the meantime, we're going to watch episode #203, Barnaby Under Siege."
3039,2,11,The Class,[Softly.] Aawwww.
3040,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, sorry, I taped these at home, so there's more commercials."
3041,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"Hey kids, do you love Cheesy Poofs?"
3042,2,11,The Class,Yes.
3043,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"Well, Cheesy Poofs is looking for a kid to sing the happy Cheesy Poofs song. Watch for our talent van as it goes around the country."
3044,2,11,Eric Cartman,I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song!
3045,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"If you win, you could be picked to be in our next Cheesy Poofs commercial. So remember,

I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame."
3046,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's quiet down so the nice bus driver can concentrate on the road."
3047,2,11,Ms Crabtree,THAT AIN'T HOW YOU DO IT! YOU DO IT LIKE THIS: SIDDOWN AND SHUT UP!!
3048,2,11,Mr Garrison,"[Rubbing the back of his head.] Ow! Jesus, lady!"
3049,2,11,Ms Crabtree,"THIS IS THE PLANETARIUM, WATCH YOUR STEP ON THE WAY DOWN SO AS NOT TO HURT YOURSEELF!"
3050,2,11,Kid,[Voice quivering.] Ow.
3051,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, now I'm going to remind you that this is a planetarium, not a Bangkok brothel. Let's behave ourselves."
3052,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,[Over a loudspeaker nearby.] Does your child have what it takes to be the next Cheesy Poofs anthem singer?
3053,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, there it is!"
3054,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,We're going around the country to find the kid who can sing the Cheesy Poofs song better than anybody.
3055,2,11,Eric Cartman,I can sing the Cheesy Poofs song with both hands tied behind my back!
3056,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"You couldn't get both arms behind your back, fatass!"
3057,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Come on, Eric. We're going to the planetarium."
3058,2,11,Eric Cartman,But I'll have to sing the Cheesy Poofs song for that talent va-a-an!
3059,2,11,Mr Garrison,"No, you have to go in this building and see a bunch of stupid stars! Now, come on!"
3060,2,11,Eric Cartman,[Whining.] But I wanna sing the Cheesy Poofs song on the commercial!
3061,2,11,A Boy,"Wow, don't you...?"
3062,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,What is that?
3063,2,11,Dr Adams,"Hello, children. My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane'arium."
3064,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"I thought it was ""plane-*tarium*."""
3065,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, it is. But I have a bone disease which impedes my ability to pronounce the ""t"" in ""plane'arium""."
3066,2,11,Mr Garrison,That's a pretty weird bone disease.
3067,2,11,Dr Adams,Yes. Perhaps someday I can get a bone-marrow transplant.
3068,2,11,Dr Adams,"Yes, little boy?"
3069,2,11,Eric Cartman,How long is that Cheesy Poofs van gonna be outside?
3070,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well I don't know. But anyway, boys and girls, soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe. But first, I wanna show you how the plane'arium works."
3071,2,11,Eric Cartman,As if we care.
3072,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, who are you?"
3073,2,11,Dr Adams,"Ughuh, little Missy here runs the big projector for us."
3074,2,11,Missy,I love my work.
3075,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude! You're only as old as us; shouldn't you be in school?"
3076,2,11,Missy,I love my work.
3077,2,11,Dr Adams,"Come on. Let's get into the plane'arium, shall we?"
3078,2,11,Dr Adams,"Good morning, children, and welcome to the plane'arium. We're going on a fascinating ride through the universe, so I want you to lean back in your chairs and get comfortable."
3079,2,11,Stan Marsh,This is stupid.
3080,2,11,Dr Adams,And now I'm going to dim the lights and let the stars... eh-come out.
3081,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,[Not amused.] Whoopie.
3082,2,11,Dr Adams,"Here we see the constellation called, ""The Big Dipper"". If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it...[Very softly.] a-hah [The drawing appears, connecting the stars.] ...we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull..."
3083,2,11,Dr Adams,"...while these stars form the constellation, ""Roger Ebert""."
3084,2,11,Dr Adams,And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades.
3085,2,11,Dr Adams,"Now, stars are actually made of hot gas, which is exactly what comes out of..."
3086,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, screw this."
3087,2,11,Dr Adams,And now breathe deep as the stars sloowwly start to move in little circles.
3088,2,11,Dr Adams,"I know you think plane'ariums are boring, but I'm gonna try to change the way you think about that."
3089,2,11,Boy,"...you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs, we'd be lame."
3090,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"That was great, Tommy. Tommy Fritz from Torrey Pines! He could be our winner."
3091,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Excuse me, but I do believe that sucked ass!"
3092,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"Oh, and what's your name, little boy?"
3093,2,11,Eric Cartman,Eric Cartman.
3094,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,"Alright, here's Eric Cartman giving it a shot."
3095,2,11,Tommy,Aaah!
3096,2,11,Eric Cartman,"[Clears his throat and affects a tenor]

I love Cheesy Poofs
you love Cheesy Poofs
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs
we'd be lame.
I'm talkin' Night-Court-in-it's-fifth-season lame-aaaahh!"
3097,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Announcer,[Slapping his palm to his head] Wow!
3098,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Thaat's right, suck on that."
3099,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, kids, how did you like the planetarium?"
3100,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, man, I don't feel so good."
3101,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Me neither, but... I loved the planetarium."
3102,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Me too. It was sweet.
3103,2,11,Mr Garrison,Really? What did you like best about it?
3104,2,11,Stan Marsh,I don't know. I don't even remember what happened.
3105,2,11,Mr Garrison,[Tallying.] Wait a minute. Where is Eric?
3106,2,11,Eric Cartman,[Happily popping by.] I did it! I did it!
3107,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Did what?
3108,2,11,Eric Cartman,I got a call-back for the Cheesy Poofs song!
3109,2,11,Mr Garrison,You snuck off and sang that stupid song?!
3110,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, dude, but I got in the finals for tomorrow!"
3111,2,11,Dr Adams,"[Now at the door.] Goodbye, children. Thanks for visiting. Don't forget: we have Laser Rock shows at night here at the plane-'arium. This week it's Laser Kenny Loggins and Laser James Taylor."
3112,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,My head still feels funny.
3113,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, mine too."
3114,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, when I'm done with that- Cheesy Poofs commercial, I bet I get all the free Cheesy Poofs I want."
3115,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Like you really need it, hippo-ass!"
3116,2,11,Eric Cartman,"[With some pity.] It's sad how jealous you are, Kyle. It really is."
3117,2,11,Boy,Waaaah!
3118,2,11,Stan Marsh,AAAAAH!
3119,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,AAAAAH!
3120,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude! Who the hell are you?!"
3121,2,11,Boy,[Haltingly.] My... name... is... vvan... G-gelder.
3122,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Van Gelder?? What the hell are you doing on our bus?! Mr. Garrison, there's some freaky kid from the planetarium on our bus!"
3123,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, great! Well I guess we have to go back!"
3124,2,11,Van Gelder,[In a state of panic.] Nnno! Nn-don't go back! Nnno!
3125,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, be careful, asshole!"
3126,2,11,Van Gelder,Eegh! Don't take me back there!
3127,2,11,Van Gelder,I can't... can't...
3128,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Alright, dude. Mellow out, jeez!"
3129,2,11,Van Gelder,Aaaagghh.
3130,2,11,Mr Garrison,"[Quickly at his side.] We've better get him to the nurse's office, stat!"
3131,2,11,Van Gelder,[Very agitated.] Aagh! The planetarium! Haah!
3132,2,11,Nurse Gollum,I'll give him a pain killer. That should calm him down.
3133,2,11,Van Gelder,Nno! Nnno pain killer! I'll be okay!
3134,2,11,Mr Mackey,Okay uh van Gelder-
3135,2,11,Van Gelder,Nnnaaaah!
3136,2,11,Mr Mackey,"-okay uh I'm Counselor Mackey. Have you been smokin' marijawana? Marijawana's bad, mkay?"
3137,2,11,Van Gelder,Eh must... tell... the machine. The machine is... e-e-e-ghe gheh-
3138,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Well, I've never seen anything like this. What do you think, principal?"
3139,2,11,Principal Victoria,"Well, whatever happened to him happened at the planetarium."
3140,2,11,Van Gelder,Haah! Planetarium!
3141,2,11,Principal Victoria,I think tonight the planetarium is doing Laser Loggins. I might have to check it out.
3142,2,11,Van Gelder,Nnaaah!
3143,2,11,Principal Victoria,"Oh, man, this is boring!"
3144,2,11,Man,"Yeah, who the heck finds this stuff interesting?"
3145,2,11,Teen 1,"Dude, this is totally killer."
3146,2,11,Teen 2,"I hope this goes on for like, seven months, man."
3147,2,11,Dr Adams,You will not remember what happened here. To remember it will cause incredible pain.
3148,2,11,Dr Adams,Incredible pain!
3149,2,11,Dr Adams,Incredible icky paaiin!
3150,2,11,Teen 1,"Dude, I'm totally tripping."
3151,2,11,Teen 2,This is totally killer.
3152,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, today we're going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku. A haiku is just like a normal American poem, except that it doesn't rhyme, and it's totally stupid. For example- Uh, where is Eric Cartman?"
3153,2,11,Stan Marsh,That's a haiku?
3154,2,11,Mr Garrison,"No, I'm asking why Eric Cartman isn't at school."
3155,2,11,Stan Marsh,Oh.
3156,2,11,Mr Garrison,Was he on the school bus this morning?
3157,2,11,Stan Marsh,No.
3158,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[counting off the syllables]

Fatass Cartman was
not on the school bus today.
What a big, fat turd."
3159,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Hoh, very good haiku, Kyle. Yes- haikus have five syllables, then seven, then five. Kenny, can you give us another example?"
3160,2,11,Kenny McCormick,"(When you rub your dick,
you might find a discharge that
winds up on the floor.)"
3161,2,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah. What's a discharge?
3162,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, since haiku sucks so much ass, could we go to the planetarium again?"
3163,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wanna go to the planetarium again, too."
3164,2,11,Mr Garrison,But you were just there! Why do you wanna go again so soon?
3165,2,11,Stan Marsh,"[Stumped, then to Kyle.] Yeah, why do we wanna go again so soon?"
3166,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,I dunno. I just have this sudden urge to go back.
3167,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, I guess we could go again, since it's just down the street."
3168,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Well, hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams."
3169,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Eric, where have you been?"
3170,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Let's see, where have I been, where have I been?"
3171,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Where have you been, Cartman?"
3172,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Wweell, I might have been over at the Cheesy Poofs call-back, winning regional championship!"
3173,2,11,The Class,Whoa!
3174,2,11,Eric Cartman,"This is my regional championship certificate! Do you like it? [Now taunting.] Hey, where is your regional championship 'tificate, Clyde? Oh, you don't have one?"
3175,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hmmm. Do you have a regional certificate, Wendy? Nno?"
3176,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Apparently, only I do."
3177,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Ass full of pork fat
jiggles like a Jello mold.
Mouth is flapping, too."
3178,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Your haiku insults have no effect on me, Kyle. I'm regional champion."
3179,2,11,Stan Marsh,Does that mean you're gonna be on that Cheesy Poofs commercial?
3180,2,11,Eric Cartman,It's between me and four other kids. I'm on my way now with my mom to the finals.
3181,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"I bet you don't win.
They don't let big fat asses
perform on TV."
3182,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Very good, Kyle."
3183,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Shut your God-damned mouth
or else I'm... gonna... kick you
square in the balls... ass-hole
Aw, damn it!"
3184,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Um. How's he doing, nurse?"
3185,2,11,Nurse Gollum,"He's stable, but I still can't get any information out of him. I'm gonna sedate him now."
3186,2,11,Van Gelder,Nno! No drugs.
3187,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Drugs are good, mkay?"
3188,2,11,Van Gelder,Nno! Don't let them g-go... planetarium!
3189,2,11,Nurse Gollum,"But why, van Gelder?"
3190,2,11,Van Gelder,The machine. The machine is aaaah.
3191,2,11,Mr Mackey,The machine is aaaah? Uh that's probably bad.
3192,2,11,Nurse Gollum,"He's been talking about ""the machine"" for hours. That and Daisy Fuentes."
3193,2,11,Van Gelder,Wha- why in America's Funniest Home Videos? Why?
3194,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Uh, there's only one way to get any sense out of him. We're gonna have to try a mind meld, mkay?"
3195,2,11,Nurse Gollum,A what?
3196,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Well, it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor. I don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope."
3197,2,11,Nurse Gollum,"Well, what will you need?"
3198,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Just time to prepare, nurse. Just time. [Oh, the tension!] Mkay?"
3199,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, children, I'm so glad you came back to learn more."
3200,2,11,Mr Garrison,They just begged to come back; I couldn't get them to shut up about it.
3201,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, I'm sure we're going to have a marvelous time. Won't we, children?"
3202,2,11,The Class,Yes.
3203,2,11,Teen 1,"This way, please."
3204,2,11,Teen 2,Enjoy your visit.
3205,2,11,Dr Adams,"Billions of stars and billions of galaxies make up our universe. Here you see Polaris, the dog star."
3206,2,11,Mr Garrison,I'm just gonna step outside and go weewee.
3207,2,11,Dr Adams,"Certainly, Mr. Garrison."
3208,2,11,Dr Adams,You love the planetarium! To be without the planetarium causes you horrible pain! All you want to do is help the planetarium thrive! To not do so makes your stomach ache with needlelike stab-
3209,2,11,Dr Adams,...and right over here we see the constellation Orion.
3210,2,11,Dr Adams,"Orion's belt is made up of three stars, one of which is actually a pulsar..."
3211,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what just happened?"
3212,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,What do you mean?
3213,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we've gotta get out of here before something bad happens."
3214,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Don't pick your nose, hon."
3215,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I wasn't picking it-I had an itch, for cryin' out loud!"
3216,2,11,Liane Cartman,Don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll win.
3217,2,11,Eric Cartman,I don't know. There's a lot of competition here.
3218,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,"Do you think I might win, Mommy?"
3219,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,"I hope so, honey. Then perhaps we can eat for a little while."
3220,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, look! They're giving away bread outside!"
3221,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,"[Gasps.] Did you hear that, Mommy?"
3222,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,Come on! Perhaps we can get some food in our stomachs!
3223,2,11,Eric Cartman,Sike!
3224,2,11,Mr Garrison,[Noticing them.] What the hell are you boys doing? You're supposed to be in there.
3225,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Garrison, we think that the planetarium guy is-"
3226,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Sshh!
3227,2,11,Dr Adams,"Goodbye, children. Thanks for coming."
3228,2,11,Clyde Donovan,[Insistently.] I wanna go again. I wanna go again!
3229,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Oh, for Pete's sake, Clyde. You just went!"
3230,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, Clyde, if you like the plane'arium so much, perhaps you'd like to do some volunteer work here."
3231,2,11,Clyde Donovan,"Yes. Yes, please!"
3232,2,11,Butters Stotch,Me too!
3233,2,11,Annie Knitts,Me too! I wanna do it! I'd love to work here.
3234,2,11,A Poor Girl and Her Mom,I'd like to tape the show!
3235,2,11,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, me too! Me too!"
3236,2,11,Fosse McDonald,"Yeah, me tohohoo. Plahanehetaharium's gahahay!"
3237,2,11,Dr Adams,Mr. Garrison?
3238,2,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, I guess I could give them extra credit for it."
3239,2,11,Dr Adams,Excellent! Why don't we step over here and I'll show all you children how to volunteer.
3240,2,11,The Class,Hooray!
3241,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this isn't right."
3242,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
3243,2,11,Stan Marsh,"We're kids, dude. We don't volunteer for anything."
3244,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, yeah."
3245,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we've gotta see what's going on in there."
3246,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Here's the control panel that operates all the stars.
3247,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Kenny, you go out there and tell us what you see."
3248,2,11,Kenny McCormick,(Okay. Got to have some huggin'.)
3249,2,11,Stan Marsh,He hits this switch-
3250,2,11,Kenny McCormick,(I don't see anything.)
3251,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"You see? Nothing, dude. Just a bunch of stars."
3252,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I guess so."
3253,2,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Whoa, dude.)"
3254,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,What does that do?
3255,2,11,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
3256,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,Kenny! What's it doing?
3257,2,11,Stan Marsh,"This says ""maximum."""
3258,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, we've killed Kenny!"
3259,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,We're bastards!
3260,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I told you something was up with this place!"
3261,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"We've gotta go tell somebody, quick!"
3262,2,11,Boy,"(clap clap clap)

3263,2,11,Center Judge,"[Applauds.] Thank you... uh, Peter. We'll let you know very soon."
3264,2,11,Center Judge,"Next will be uuh, Eric Theodore Cartman."
3265,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Hello, everybody. [To Cartman.] Now, just do it like we rehearsed, hon."
3266,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I know, I know!"
3267,2,11,Eric Cartman,"She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right."
3268,2,11,Eric Cartman,"She works hard for the money
So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money, so you'd better treat her right."
3269,2,11,Center Judge,"[Long pause.] Well, Eric Cartman, that certainly was... insane."
3270,2,11,Eric Cartman,Thank you.
3271,2,11,Center Judge,We'll let you know.
3272,2,11,Liane Cartman,Thank you.
3273,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Don't pick your nose, hon."
3274,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I'm not pickin' it ma! God damn it, I have an itch!"
3275,2,11,Center Judge,"Jesus, where do we find these people?!"
3276,2,11,Mr Mackey,Our minds are one. Mkay? Our thoughts are one. Mkay?
3277,2,11,Nurse Gollum,This is the strangest thing I've ever seen!
3278,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Please, nurse, for a woman with a dead fetus on your head, you're not being very open-minded."
3279,2,11,Mr Mackey,Open your mind to your counselor. Open your mind.
3280,2,11,Van Gelder,[Responding to the mind-meld.] Dr. Adams.
3281,2,11,Mr Mackey,Yes.
3282,2,11,Nurse Gollum,He owns the planetarium. What about him?
3283,2,11,Van Gelder Mr Mackey simultaneously,He uses the machine. The star machine.
3284,2,11,Mr Mackey,Mkay?
3285,2,11,Van Gelder Mr Mackey simultaneously,He uses it to erase minds.
3286,2,11,Nurse Gollum,But why?
3287,2,11,Van Gelder Mr Mackey simultaneously,"Planetarium, about to go out of business. Adams had to create slaves to survive."
3288,2,11,Nurse Gollum,My God! This is amazing!
3289,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Abuh. Please, nurse, you're throwin' off my chi! Mkay?"
3290,2,11,Center Judge,"Well, we'd certainly like to thank all our finalists. Only one of our finalists can win the grand prize and... unfortunately, that finalist is Eric Cartman."
3291,2,11,Eric Cartman,[Triumphantly.] Yes! I'm the best!
3292,2,11,Center Judge,You were actually our last choice. Uh the other children have unexpectedly taken jobs as volunteers at the planetarium.
3293,2,11,Blonde Judge,That's odd.
3294,2,11,Eric Cartman,[Joyfully.] Sweeet!
3295,2,11,Tom,It appears that more and more South Park residents are discovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium. Here with a special report is a 34-year old Asian man who looks strikingly similar to Ricardo Montalban.
3296,2,11,Asian Reporter,"Thanks, Tom. Yes, indeed, the planetarium has become very popular as word spreads that it really isn't as lame and stupid as one suspected. I'm here with the planetarium operator, Dr. Adams."
3297,2,11,Dr Adams,"Thank you. I'd like to open an invitation to all South Park residents to come see a special free show this evening. I guarantee, it will change the way you think about the plane'ah-arium."
3298,2,11,Asian Reporter,"So, bring the whole family to the plane-*tarium* for a night of excitement and wonder."
3299,2,11,Stan Marsh,"...and then we turned the dial, and Kenny went into a kind of hypnosis."
3300,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"That's a pretty far-fetched story, boys."
3301,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"But it's true, dude!"
3302,2,11,Officer Barbrady,Are you boys sure you're not just making this all up?
3303,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, pretty sure."
3304,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, just as soon as I handle all the other crime in South Park, I'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so I can prove that nothing's wrong."
3305,2,11,Stan Marsh,What other crime in South Park?
3306,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, yeah. Let's go."
3307,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,Okay. Let's shoot the commercial. Where's our Cheesy Poof talent?
3308,2,11,Eric Cartman,I'm over here.
3309,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Oohh, you look great, hon. Mommy's fat little piggy."
3310,2,11,Eric Cartman,Aay!
3311,2,11,Eric Cartman,Let's hurry. This costume is hot.
3312,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,"Okay, roll camera, aaand action."
3313,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you-"
3314,2,11,Liane Cartman,"Oh wait, wait."
3315,2,11,Liane Cartman,"You've got a little eye booger, hon."
3316,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, Mom, for Pete's sake!"
3317,2,11,Liane Cartman,Got it.
3318,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,Aaand action.
3319,2,11,Eric Cartman,I love Cheesy Poofs-
3320,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,Hold it! Cut! Could we get some more light on that backdrop?
3321,2,11,Stagehand,Sure thing.
3322,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man, c'mon!"
3323,2,11,Stagehand,Got it.
3324,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,"Okay. Here we go, aaand action."
3325,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I love Cheesy Poofs, you love Chee-"
3326,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,Cut!
3327,2,11,Eric Cartman,What?!
3328,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Director,I'm not liking the shoes. Could we change the shoes?
3329,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, God damnit!"
3330,2,11,Dr Adams,"Oh. Hello, officer of the law."
3331,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Planetarium Operator."
3332,2,11,Dr Adams,What brings you out here?
3333,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, these boys seem to think you're some kind of sick weirdo that's got a master plan to screw with the minds of everyone in town."
3334,2,11,Dr Adams,"Oh, really?"
3335,2,11,Officer Barbrady,Yeah. I just thought I'd come show them around so they'd know there's nothing to be scared of.
3336,2,11,Dr Adams,"Actually, this is a pretty inopportune time."
3337,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Okay, I'll be quick, then."
3338,2,11,Dr Adams,"Of course, officer. Come on in."
3339,2,11,Chef,"[In a low monotone.] Hello, children."
3340,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no! They got Chef, too!"
3341,2,11,Chef,Welcome to the planetarium.
3342,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Well, it's nice to see you finally got a real job, Chef."
3343,2,11,Chef,"[Slowly, mechanically.] I love my work."
3344,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh I know what you mean. I've always loved the planetarium, too."
3345,2,11,Dr Adams,"Would you like to see the stars, officer?"
3346,2,11,Stan Marsh,No!
3347,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,No!
3348,2,11,Officer Barbrady,That would be super-duper!
3349,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't do it, Officer Barbrady!"
3350,2,11,Elderly Woman,[On the phone.] Hello?
3351,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Hi, Grandma. It's me, Eric."
3352,2,11,Grandma Cartman,"Oh, hello, Eric. Grandma sure has missed you."
3353,2,11,Eric Cartman,"I just wanted to remind you that I'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch."
3354,2,11,Grandma Cartman,"Oh, I will, Eric. You know, I remember when I was a little girl and had my first talent show audition for-"
3355,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Okay, bye."
3356,2,11,The Marshes Answering Machine,Hello? The-uh Marshes aren't in right now. Please leave a message.
3357,2,11,Eric Cartman,Stan? I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Be sure to watch.
3358,2,11,The Broflovskis Answering Machine,"Hello, you've reached the Broflovskis. Please, leave a message."
3359,2,11,Eric Cartman,Where the hell is everybody?! I'm gonna be on TV tonight. You guys better not miss it!
3360,2,11,Dr Adams,And this is the constellation called Cassiopeia.
3361,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, neato!"
3362,2,11,Dr Adams,"[Turning intensity up to 8.5] And now, officer, from this moment on, you will think that you are Elvis Presley."
3363,2,11,Officer Barbrady,Who?
3364,2,11,Dr Adams,To not be Elvis will cause you great pain.
3365,2,11,Officer Barbrady,Pain.
3366,2,11,Dr Adams,"You see, children? There's no stopping me. Even your highly intelligent policemen are no match for me."
3367,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,He's not highly intelligent.
3368,2,11,Stan Marsh,"Why are you doing this, dude?"
3369,2,11,Dr Adams,"Why? Because nowadays kids have computers, surround-sound television. They've forgotten all about plane'ariums. But I'll make them remember, starting with the two of you!"
3370,2,11,Voice over,Terrance and Phillip will be right back after these announcements.
3371,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, dude, here it comes!"
3372,2,11,Cheesy Poofs Commercial Hopefuls,"Packed full of ingredients, Cheesy Poofs can really give you that quick pick-me-up. So remember, [A dancing Cheesy Poofs box appears.] 
I love Cheesy Poofs,
you love Cheesy Poofs
[The box opens and Cheesy Poof pour out.]
If we didn't eat Cheesy Poofs,
we'd be-
[The Cheesy Poofs rain down on a pile of Cheesy Poof in which children swim.]"
3373,2,11,Cheesy Poof Cartman,Lame.
3374,2,11,Voice over,And now back to Terrance and Phillip.
3375,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Yes! Yes, that was me! I was on television!"
3376,2,11,Mr Mackey,Aha! Caught you red-handed! Mkay!
3377,2,11,Stan Marsh,Mr. Mackey!
3378,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Officer Barbrady, uh, this man is using some kind of mind control."
3379,2,11,Officer Barbrad,[Doing a twisted Elvis Presley.] Wuzzariah? Ulduhooyah? Guh. Ahoohooyuh?
3380,2,11,Nurse Gollum,What's wrong with him?
3381,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"Ah-yeah, babe, yeah, babe
uhyeah hwah yeah hwah wayah ahowowowowayah."
3382,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Oh no, apparently, he thinks he's Charlton Heston."
3383,2,11,Dr Adams,"No, you idiot! He thinks he's Elvis. [To Barbrady.] Elvis, escort our guests to the plane'arium."
3384,2,11,Officer Barbrady,[Snapping into a sharp Elvis.] Holdjit
3385,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"If you wouldn't mind, uugh. Could you please follow me?"
3386,2,11,Mr Mackey,Uh oh.
3387,2,11,Officer Barbrady,[Voice skipping up the scales.] Odle-oh who whoo?
3388,2,11,Dr Adams,"Well, let's begin, shall we?"
3389,2,11,Dr Adams,"And now you'll remember nothing, except that the planet'arium is the best thing you've ever known!"
3390,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Well, well well! You guys can now kiss my ass, because I was on television!"
3391,2,11,Eric Cartman,Ey! Didn't you guys see it?! I was on television!
3392,2,11,Eric Cartman,You missed it! You missed it because of this stupid planetarium!
3393,2,11,Eric Cartman,Planetariums suck ass!
3394,2,11,Dr Adams,Aaah. Aaah. Aaah.
3395,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,[Coming out of the trance.] Cartman! You saved us!
3396,2,11,Eric Cartman,What the hell are you talking about?
3397,2,11,Stan Marsh,Get over here and untie us!
3398,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Eric, you really saved the day. Mkay?"
3399,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"[Rushing in.] Not so fast there, tubby. Uh I'm just takin' care of business."
3400,2,11,Mr Mackey,"Think hard, Elvis. You're not really the king of rock and roll. You're a fat, stupid, worthless policeman in a small town. Mkay?"
3401,2,11,Officer Barbrady,"[Snapping out of it.] Oh, thank you from a fate worse than death, counselor."
3402,2,11,Stan Marsh,Oh my God! Dr. Adams!
3403,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,He got a full dose of the stars.
3404,2,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah. With nobody around to say anything.
3405,2,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Can you imagine it, Stan. A mind, emptied by that... thing."
3406,2,11,Eric Cartman,"Wow. What a day this has been. I was on TV, and, I'm a hero."
3407,2,11,Liane Cartman,"[Looking in.] Don't pick your nose, hon."
3408,2,11,Eric Cartman,"God damnit, Mom, I wasn't pickin' it! I have an itch!"
3409,2,12,Stan Marsh,Sgt. Stanley Marsh is trapped behind enemy lines. His only chance of survival is to sneak past the Bosnian guard who stands watch.
3410,2,12,Stan Marsh,Sgt. Marsh knows it's now or never. He must make a run for it.
3411,2,12,Stan Marsh,American base is only a few feet away.
3412,2,12,Eric Cartman,What is this? Halt!
3413,2,12,Eric Cartman,It will take more than your weak American weapons to destroy me!
3414,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, we shot your Bosnian fat ass!"
3415,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah! You're dead!
3416,2,12,Eric Cartman,"I have Class 4 armor on, that, uh, ih-ih--"
3417,2,12,Stan Marsh,"No, you don't!"
3418,2,12,Eric Cartman,"--special armor, that's impenetrable to American bullets."
3419,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude! Every time we play Americans vs. Bosnians, you cheat!"
3420,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Cartman, you suck! If you want to play Americans vs. Bosnians any more, you can just play with yourself!"
3421,2,12,Eric Cartman,That's fine! I'd like playing with myself! I'll play with myself all day long!
3422,2,12,Eric Cartman,What?
3423,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Well? Now what are we going to do?
3424,2,12,Stan Marsh,Huh-I dunno.
3425,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, Stan."
3426,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Hi, Wendy."
3427,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Kyle, doesn't Bebe look pretty today?"
3428,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,I dunno.
3429,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,She does. She looks very pretty.
3430,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
3431,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, can I talk to you for a second?"
3432,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, wouldn't it be fun if we fixed Kyle up with Bebe?"
3433,2,12,Stan Marsh,...No.
3434,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"If Bebe and Kyle were a couple, then we can invite them over to your clubhouse for dinner and play parlor games and have meaningful conversations and sip cognac by the fireplace."
3435,2,12,Stan Marsh,We could?
3436,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah, Stan."
3437,2,12,Stan Marsh,"But dude, I don't have a clubhouse."
3438,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,You don't?? I thought all guys had clubhouses.
3439,2,12,Stan Marsh,Just how many guys' clubhouses have you been in?
3440,2,12,Eric Cartman,Herr Kommandant Cartman has ways of making you talk!
3441,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Heellp!!)
3442,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, you have to build a clubhouse! Then all four of us can sit in it and play Truth or Dare!"
3443,2,12,Stan Marsh,[Intrigued.] Truth or Dare? Wow.
3444,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Kyle. We've got work to do."
3445,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,We do?
3446,2,12,Stan Marsh,We're gonna build a clubhouse. I have to ask my dad for help.
3447,2,12,Bebe Stevens,[To Wendy.] Did it work?
3448,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"I think it did, Bebe. If all goes as planned, Kyle will be your new boyfriend."
3449,2,12,Bebe Stevens,I hope so Wendy. He's got such a hot ass.
3450,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Hey, Phillip, pull my finger."
3451,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"All right, Terrance."
3452,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Hurgh. Oh, wait wait wait. Pull harder."
3453,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Well, all right."
3454,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Hurgh, urgh."

3461,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"God. Oh, you got me, Terrance!"
3462,2,12,Terrance and Phillip,"Yes, I sure did!"
3463,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching Terrance and Phillip."
3464,2,12,Randy Marsh,"No, I was just uh flipping through the channels."
3465,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse."
3466,2,12,Randy Marsh,Okay.
3467,2,12,Stan Marsh,How do we do it?
3468,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood. What? Uh some girls wanna play Truth or Dare or something?"
3469,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude! How'd you know?"
3470,2,12,Randy Marsh,How do you think I met your mother?
3471,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"[Walks in.] Randy, my wedding ring! I lost it down the garbage disposal!"
3472,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, brother."
3473,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, I thought I told you not to watch this horrible cartoon!"
3474,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, Stanley, you should know better."
3475,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dude!
3476,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Here, Stanley, You watch nice cartoons like Fat Abbot."
3477,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, will you please come get my wedding ring out of the sink?"
3478,2,12,Randy Marsh,"[Resisting.] Okay, okay."
3479,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Hey hey hey. What's goin' on, Rudy?"
3480,2,12,Rudy,"Man, Fat Abbot, you need to lose weight!"
3481,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"I'll lose weight when I feel like it, bitch! Shut yo bitchass mouth, ho!"
3482,2,12,Rudy,"Bitch, I'll kick yo ass!"
3483,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude!"
3484,2,12,Stan Marsh,Sweet!
3485,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"You think you're slick, you punkass blasphemous dope-fiend bitch! I had my jimmy whacked seven times last week! I'll bust a cap in yo nigga ass, shithole!"
3486,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, cartoons are getting really dirty!"
3487,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Did you find it?
3488,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Give me a second, would you?"
3489,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Don't snap at me!
3490,2,12,Randy Marsh,I didn't snap at you.
3491,2,12,Sharon Marsh,You snapped at me!
3492,2,12,Randy Marsh,Whatever.
3493,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"What ever?! In fifteen years you've never said, ""whatever,"" to me!"
3494,2,12,Randy Marsh,"I-I don't wanna fight, I'm sorry."
3495,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"I'm sorry, too."
3496,2,12,Randy Marsh,Uh I think I found it.
3497,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"That's not it, you idiot!"
3498,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, back off, bitch!"
3499,2,12,Sharon Marsh,[Gasps.] You just said the C-word!
3500,2,12,Randy Marsh,Did I?
3501,2,12,Stan Marsh,This is a sweet spot for a clubhouse.
3502,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Hey Stan, what did your dad mean when he said we're gonna play Truth or Dare?"
3503,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh uh, just that, mmmaybe when we're finished, Wendy and- uh... Bebe can come over and play."
3504,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? Girls suck ass."
3505,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Well-uhuh, of course they do, but uh, wouldn't it be sweet to- to play Truth or Dare with them?"
3506,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,What? Why?
3507,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Because, dude. We could make them do really gross stuff, like eat bugs."
3508,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hey yeah! That'd be sweet! We could totally ruin their lives!
3509,2,12,Eric Cartman,What are you guys doing?
3510,2,12,Stan Marsh,We're building a clubhouse.
3511,2,12,Eric Cartman,"[Laughs heartily.] A clubhouse? Heheh, that's the lamest thing I've ever heard!"
3512,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not lame, it's sweet! After we build this clubhouse, we're gonna get girls to play Truth or Dare!"
3513,2,12,Eric Cartman,[Thinks it over.] Wwwhy??
3514,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Because, dumbass, we can dare them to do gross stuff and make them cry! What? Were you born yesterday?"
3515,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, now beat it you guys. This clubhouse is private!"
3516,2,12,Eric Cartman,That's fine. We'll build our own clubhouse!
3517,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Fine!
3518,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Fine! And then we'll get girls to play Truth or Dare, too!"
3519,2,12,Stan Marsh,Fine!
3520,2,12,Eric Cartman,Fine!
3521,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Fine!
3522,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Fine!)
3523,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Fine!
3524,2,12,Eric Cartman,Fine! That's fine.
3525,2,12,Stan Marsh,Fine!
3526,2,12,Eric Cartman,Fine!
3527,2,12,Eric Cartman,"No, Kenny, you can't look, I'm the foreman!"
3528,2,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, why the fuck do I have to do everything while you stand around in the snow lookin--)"
3529,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Because, Kenny, your family's poor. You have to be the worker."
3530,2,12,Kenny McCormick,[Still trying.] (Uh--)
3531,2,12,Eric Cartman,"No, Kenny."
3532,2,12,Liane Cartman,"[Stopping by.] How's the treehouse coming along, hon?"
3533,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Mom, it's not a treehouse, it's a clubhouse!"
3534,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Sorry, hon."
3535,2,12,Eric Cartman,Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?
3536,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Well, I don't know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare."
3537,2,12,Eric Cartman,"[Sliding into a whine.] But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!"
3538,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Well, all right."
3539,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now."
3540,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(You suck ass and you suck dick!)
3541,2,12,Eric Cartman,And stop your bitchin'!
3542,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"What are you doing, sweetheart?"
3543,2,12,Stan Marsh,Getting a cookie. We're building a clubhouse and then we're--
3544,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it's the way I cook! I suppose next you'll be telling me that you need your space and that I'm sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!"
3545,2,12,Stan Marsh,'Kay.
3546,2,12,Mr Garrison,"And so, children, today we're gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?"
3547,2,12,Mr Twig,"Uh- that's right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--"
3548,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,When is Mr. Hat coming back?
3549,2,12,Mr Garrison,What did you say?!
3550,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,When is Mr. Hat coming back?
3551,2,12,Mr Garrison,"I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again! Mr. Hat is a two-timin' whore, and now we all learn from Mr. Twig!"
3552,2,12,Stan Marsh,But Mr. Twig sucks.
3553,2,12,Class,Yeah.
3554,2,12,Mr Garrison,"That is enough! Mr. Hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and I don't wanna hear it! Anyway, children, lets turn our history textbooks to page 105, which should be right after page 104..."
3555,2,12,Eric Cartman,"So, how's your lame-ass clubhouse, Stan?"
3556,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Better than yours, fat boy."
3557,2,12,Eric Cartman,"We'll see about that. [To Kenny.] Don't forget you need to cut school early and wait for the hot tub, Kenny."
3558,2,12,Kenny McCormick,"[Gruffly.] (Yes, sir..!)"
3559,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,Is the clubhouse ready?
3560,2,12,Stan Marsh,Almost.
3561,2,12,Mr Garrison,Stan? Are you paying attention?
3562,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yes, Mr. Garrison."
3563,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?"
3564,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the Love Boat, the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings."
3565,2,12,Mr Garrison,"...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention."
3566,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn't work. Probably 'cause Robert Urich had to weigh..."
3567,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Good guess, dude!"
3568,2,12,Stan Marsh,Phew.
3569,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Pssst! Pass this up.
3570,2,12,Butters Stotch,Pass this up.
3571,2,12,Kevin Stoley,Pass this up.
3572,2,12,Fosse McDonald,P-huh pass this h-up.
3573,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!"
3574,2,12,Stan Marsh,"No, I just--"
3575,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Don't lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile."
3576,2,12,Stan Marsh,I'm not lying. Someone just handed me the--
3577,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Stanley, if you think it's so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don't you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!"
3578,2,12,Stan Marsh,But I didn't write the note!
3579,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, Stan's behavior is having an adverse effect on my education."
3580,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman!"
3581,2,12,Mr Garrison,"Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!"
3582,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, man."
3583,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Dear Kyle.
You have got such a great ass.
I could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you.
I'd like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity."
3584,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude!"
3585,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m'kay? Not for immature skylarkings."
3586,2,12,Stan Marsh,What's 'skylarkings'?
3587,2,12,Mr Mackey,"You know, like tomfooleries."
3588,2,12,Stan Marsh,Who?
3589,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Oh, your parents are here."
3590,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no."
3591,2,12,Mr Mackey,Thank you for coming on such short notice. I was just disciplining your son for his skylarkings.
3592,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, I... Skylarkings?"
3593,2,12,Mr Mackey,Yeahm'kay?
3594,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
3595,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school."
3596,2,12,Stan Marsh,"It wasn't my note, dude. It was some girl's."
3597,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Okay. Stanley, we're all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder."
3598,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"You really should know better, Stanley."
3599,2,12,Randy Marsh,"You need to shape up, mister."
3600,2,12,Sharon Marsh,[To Randy.] Don't interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can't you see that I--?
3601,2,12,Randy Marsh,[A bit testily.] I don't interrupt you.
3602,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"There, you did it again! [To Mr. Mackey.] He interrupted me again."
3603,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--"
3604,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Okay, I'm sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!"
3605,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation's bad."
3606,2,12,Sharon Marsh,[To Randy.] Like you're one to talk! When's the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!
3607,2,12,Mr Mackey,[Slowly.] Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.
3608,2,12,Randy Marsh,When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It's always gossip and stupid crap!
3609,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you're feeling."
3610,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn't matter what I say."
3611,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Mkay. That's valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--"
3612,2,12,Stan Marsh,Excuse me.
3613,2,12,Mr Mackey,-how do you feel?
3614,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Like I'm a ghost. Like he sees right through me.
3615,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, please!"
3616,2,12,Stan Marsh,Hello?
3617,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, please yourself!"
3618,2,12,Mr Mackey,"Who tries to control the marriage? And by that I mean, who's dominating the aspects of the relationship?"
3619,2,12,Sharon Marsh,He is.
3620,2,12,Randy Marsh,"No, she is."
3621,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, I'm sorry! I guess I'm wrong again!"
3622,2,12,Mr Mackey,Mmkay.
3623,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Look at it, Kenny. It is the greatest clubhouse ever built."
3624,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, man!"
3625,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh)
3626,2,12,Eric Cartman,"And we built it, with our own hands. Now all we need is chicks, Kenny."
3627,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
3628,2,12,Eric Cartman,"All right. You go find chicks, Kenny."
3629,2,12,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)"
3630,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I've got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin'!"
3631,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Mom, can I watch American Gladiators?"
3632,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Where have you been? I've been waiting all afternoon.
3633,2,12,Stan Marsh,I got in trouble for that note Bebe was trying to pass to you.
3634,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,To me??
3635,2,12,Stan Marsh,"I mean, no. Not to you. Forget it. Come on, dude. We have to finish our clubhouse quick. The girls wanna play Truth or Dare tomorrow!"
3636,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"We should use nails, dude."
3637,2,12,Stan Marsh,My mom won't let us.
3638,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Hi, guys. How's the clubhouse coming?"
3639,2,12,Stan Marsh,Pretty good. We're almost done.
3640,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, hurry! We wanna play Truth or Dare!"
3641,2,12,Stan Marsh,We're going as fast as we can!
3642,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Kyle, could you turn around for a second?"
3643,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Thank you.
3644,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude, we have to hammer faster."
3645,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Stan. Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?"
3646,2,12,Stan Marsh,No.
3647,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?"
3648,2,12,Stan Marsh,I didn't even think about that.
3649,2,12,Chef,"And then, they'll ask, ""Truth or Dare?'"
3650,2,12,Stan Marsh,"And I say, ""Dare!"""
3651,2,12,Chef,"No no! You say, ""Truth."""
3652,2,12,Stan Marsh,"""Truth?"" But that's boring! I want to get ""Dare"" to kiss her."
3653,2,12,Chef,"You have to say ""Truth"" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager."
3654,2,12,Stan Marsh,Oooh.
3655,2,12,Chef,"You can't seem too eager. You've got to play it cool, like you don't even care what happens."
3656,2,12,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
3657,2,12,Chef,"Then, after a few ""Truth""s, you finally answer, ""Dare."""
3658,2,12,Stan Marsh,"""Dare!"""
3659,2,12,Chef,"But not like that, son. Like this: ""Daaare""."
3660,2,12,Stan Marsh,Oooh.
3661,2,12,Chef,And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.
3662,2,12,Stan Marsh,You really think so?
3663,2,12,Chef,Of course she will. They're women. They've had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.
3664,2,12,Stan Marsh,Wow!
3665,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Heeyy hey hey. What's goin' down, y'all?"
3666,2,12,Rudy,"Man, Fat Abbot. What are you doin' on this side of the 'hood?"
3667,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"You know somethin', Rudy? You're like school in summertime."
3668,2,12,Rudy,School in summertime?
3669,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Yeah, bitch, school in summertime!"
3670,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Open yo' fuckin' ears and shit, ho, or I'll pop your bitch ass."
3671,2,12,Donald,"I'llba poppa yourba bitcha assa tooba, bitcha."
3672,2,12,Eric Cartman,What the hell is goin' on in this cartoon?
3673,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Hey, Kenny, did you find any chicks to come to the clubhouse?"
3674,2,12,Kenny McCormick,"[Proudly, with thumbs up.] (Uh-huh)"
3675,2,12,Blonde,Hi. We ran away from home.
3676,2,12,Brunette,"Well like, this kid told us we might be able to crash at your clubhouse for a couple of days."
3677,2,12,Eric Cartman,[Amazed.] Holy crap!
3678,2,12,Eric Cartman,Behold! The Ewok Village 2000!
3679,2,12,Blonde,"Oh well, I guess it beats living at home."
3680,2,12,Eric Cartman,[Enunciating properly.] Can I offer you ladies a cool beverage or a tasty snack? [Rubs his stomach.]
3681,2,12,Stan Marsh,Hello?
3682,2,12,Eric Cartman,"How's the clubhouse coming, Stan?"
3683,2,12,Stan Marsh,We're working on it.
3684,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Well, I just thought I'd tell you that me and Kenny have finished our clubhouse, and we already have chicks over."
3685,2,12,Stan Marsh,"No, you don't!"
3686,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dude!
3687,2,12,Eric Cartman,"It's only a matter of time before we're playin' Truth or Dare with them. Good luck with your piece of crap clubhouse, stupid asshole."
3688,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Aw, that hunk of fat-- [Sharon walks in.] Mom, will you please ask Dad to come help me build my clubhouse?"
3689,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, I think you should know that your father has moved out."
3690,2,12,Stan Marsh,What?! Why?
3691,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Because, we're divorced, Stanley."
3692,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Divorced? On no. Does that mean you and Dad don't love me anymore? This is all my fault, isn't it?"
3693,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, kind of."
3694,2,12,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, you're not supposed to say that!"
3695,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"But I would like you to meet your new stepfather, Roy."
3696,2,12,Roy,"Hello, son."
3697,2,12,Stan Marsh,What?!
3698,2,12,Sharon Marsh,I'll leave you two alone to get acquainted.
3699,2,12,Roy,"Hello, Stanley. I know this must be a very difficult period for you right now, and the adjustment is going to take some time. But I'd like to be your friend. So when you're ready, I want you to feel free to come to me with anything you might need, whether it's advice, or- just someone to play catch with. You can count on me."
3700,2,12,Stan Marsh,This is happening way too fast.
3701,2,12,Roy,"Oh, Jesus! When are you gonna cut me some slack, huh?! I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!"
3702,2,12,Blonde,"So, I'm on my way out the door, and she goes, ""Make sure you're home before midnight!"""
3703,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Ahaw, that's weak."
3704,2,12,Blonde,"And I go, ""Listen, bitch! I don't need my mother giving me no curfew!"""
3705,2,12,Eric Cartman,That's killer.
3706,2,12,Blonde,"And she goes, ""Yeah, well, if you're not home before midnight, don't bother coming home at all!"""
3707,2,12,Eric Cartman,That's totally weak!
3708,2,12,Blonde,"So I go, ""Fine! I won't come home!"""
3709,2,12,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
3710,2,12,Blonde,"And then she goes, ""Fine! Don't come home!"", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap."
3711,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Killer weak, sweet!"
3712,2,12,Blonde,I'm sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.
3713,2,12,Blonde,I don't need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!
3714,2,12,Eric Cartman,"I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I'm all like, ""Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I'm eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I'm gonna fingerpaint!"""
3715,2,12,Stan Marsh,Okay. We're done.
3716,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[Wiggling the railing.] Dude, I don't think this is very sturdy."
3717,2,12,Stan Marsh,"It doesn't matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I'm gonna go get the girls."
3718,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
3719,2,12,Stan Marsh,G'oh?
3720,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, it's time to go!"
3721,2,12,Stan Marsh,Go where?
3722,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you."
3723,2,12,Stan Marsh,But no! I have to get the girls to come-
3724,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Come on, Stanley!"
3725,2,12,Stan Marsh,Weak!
3726,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dad?
3727,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in."
3728,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it'd be best for all of us if we'd split up."
3729,2,12,Stan Marsh,But I don't understand why we have to--
3730,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, hello, ladies."
3731,2,12,Blonde Female Passenger,"Hi, handsome. We're gonna be at Larry's Bar tonight."
3732,2,12,Randy Marsh,[Suavely.] I'm already there.
3733,2,12,Randy Marsh,"What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don't like being around each other any more."
3734,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Well, I don't like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?"
3735,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, no, because you're a family. You just can't leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what."
3736,2,12,Stan Marsh,But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?
3737,2,12,Stan Marsh,"You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn't be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister."
3738,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Hoho, Stan, you're so young. You just don't get it."
3739,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, anyway, have a nice day."
3740,2,12,Stan Marsh,What? That's it?
3741,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out."
3742,2,12,Randy Marsh,"You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?"
3743,2,12,Stan Marsh,"I guess, but--"
3744,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute."
3745,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, if I didn't know you better, I would almost think you're doing this because you wanna play with girls."
3746,2,12,Stan Marsh,"No way, dude! Don't be silly."
3747,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"[Off screen.] Come on, Wendy."
3748,2,12,Stan Marsh,"We have to say ""Truth"" a couple of times before we say ""Dare,"" right?"
3749,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Right. Why?
3750,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Because if we don't, we'll seem too eager."
3751,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Too eager to what?
3752,2,12,Stan Marsh,"To say ""Dare,"" dumbass! Jeez."
3753,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"[Entering the clubhouse.] Hi, guys."
3754,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Oh, hi Wendy. What's up?"
3755,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Don't you guys still wanna play ""Truth or Dare""?"
3756,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever."
3757,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Then come on!
3758,2,12,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle, softly.] Remember, ""Truth"" the first couple of times."
3759,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
3760,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Who wants to go first?
3761,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,I will. Kyle?
3762,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah?
3763,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,Truth or Dare?
3764,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Umm. Dare?
3765,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dude!
3766,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,What?
3767,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,[Whispers.] How about we give him Bebe?
3768,2,12,Bebe Stevens,[Whispers.] Okay.
3769,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,[Whispers.] Okay.
3770,2,12,Bebe Stevens,[Whispers.] Okay.
3771,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,Kiss Bebe on the lips!
3772,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"What?!! Sick, dude, I'm not kissing a girl!"
3773,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"What's the matter, Kyle?"
3774,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"It's just wrong, that's all."
3775,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Don't be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes."
3776,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,What the hell have you gotten me into?!
3777,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?"
3778,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hoh boy.
3779,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Sick!
3780,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!
3781,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"[Staring at him as he leaves.] Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!"
3782,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Your turn, Bebe."
3783,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"[Seated back by Wendy.] Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?"
3784,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Stan, Truth or Dare?"
3785,2,12,Stan Marsh,[Sensually.] Dare.
3786,2,12,Roy,"Son, could you please help me with the firewood?"
3787,2,12,Stan Marsh,"...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!"
3788,2,12,Roy,"When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me."
3789,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow."
3790,2,12,Stan Marsh,Crap!
3791,2,12,Blonde,I think you should be able to move out legally when you're fourteen.
3792,2,12,Brunette,[Pulls out a cigarette.] Our moms won't even let us smoke.
3793,2,12,Blonde,"Yeah, it's my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it."
3794,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!"
3795,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, snookums! it's time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night."
3796,2,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?"
3797,2,12,Eric Cartman,"[Voice shaking.] Coming, Mom. [To the girls.] Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!"
3798,2,12,Guy in Leather Jacket,"Hey, girls."
3799,2,12,Guy with Long Hair,What's up.
3800,2,12,Blonde,"Oh hey, Scott."
3801,2,12,Eric Cartman,Who the hell are you?!
3802,2,12,Brunette,Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don't mind.
3803,2,12,Eric Cartman,How many people?
3804,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Kyle, can I talk to you?"
3805,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
3806,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart."
3807,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
3808,2,12,Bebe Stevens,I'm just feeling really trapped. I can't go on with this codependency.
3809,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, that's fine."
3810,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"No, no. Don't speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way."
3811,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,[Muffled.] But I don't care.
3812,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Please. Just remember the good times we had. I'll never forget you. Never.
3813,2,12,Bebe Stevens,"Okay, Clyde, we can go now."
3814,2,12,Clyde Donovan,Bitchin'.
3815,2,12,Host,"These are caf curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that!"
3816,2,12,Stan Marsh,Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I've had a rough day.
3817,2,12,Roy,Nnuuhunuuhh.
3818,2,12,Stan Marsh,What?
3819,2,12,Roy,Chores. Do chores.
3820,2,12,Stan Marsh,My dad lets me watch cartoons.
3821,2,12,Roy,Well I'm not your dad. Okay? I'm not your dad! You- you can't just go around playing games with my emotions.
3822,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"[Arms on her hips.] Stanley, what did you do to Roy?"
3823,2,12,Stan Marsh,Roy's a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!
3824,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"[Sighs.] Stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me, right?"
3825,2,12,Stan Marsh,"If that's true, then get back together with Dad for me!"
3826,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, ""you're the most important thing to me,"" what I mean is, you're the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances."
3827,2,12,Stan Marsh,Oh.
3828,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Bye now. Roy!
3829,2,12,Stan Marsh,Divorce is stupid.
3830,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?
3831,2,12,Yolanda,"Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye."
3832,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!
3833,2,12,Yolanda,Really?
3834,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I'm sayin'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin' shit! Damn!"
3835,2,12,Yolanda,"You're right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!"
3836,2,12,Fat Abbot and Friends,"No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!"
3837,2,12,Bill,"Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin' today. If you have a stepdad ridin' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin' the pudding."
3838,2,12,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll write a little note for Roy."
3839,2,12,Older kid,"Hey, kid, give me some of those!"
3840,2,12,Eric Cartman,Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?
3841,2,12,Blonde,What? That game's for kids.
3842,2,12,Eric Cartman,This is bullcrap!
3843,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh boy, it's getting late. I'm gonna have to leave this party."
3844,2,12,Eric Cartman,"This sucks, Kenny! I wish we'd never built a clubhouse!"
3845,2,12,Punk,Mosh pit!
3846,2,12,Kenny McCormick,(Huh?)
3847,2,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny!"
3848,2,12,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
3849,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?
3850,2,12,Roy,"Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of Harper's?"
3851,2,12,Roy,Meet me at the clubhouse.
3852,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Randy. What are you doing here?"
3853,2,12,Randy Marsh,"I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse."
3854,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Oh I thought that note was for me.
3855,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Oh, maybe it was."
3856,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here."
3857,2,12,Randy Marsh,I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.
3858,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Goodnight.
3859,2,12,Randy Marsh,Sharon?
3860,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Yes?
3861,2,12,Randy Marsh,Truth or Dare?
3862,2,12,Sharon Marsh,It's too late for games.
3863,2,12,Randy Marsh,"No, I'm serious, please. Truth or Dare?"
3864,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Truth.
3865,2,12,Randy Marsh,Do you still love me?
3866,2,12,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I'm so confused-uh. I'm living with Roy and-, I don't know how to break it off with him."
3867,2,12,Roy,Sharon--
3868,2,12,Roy,Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.
3869,2,12,Randy Marsh,"Well, you never know. Maybe--"
3870,2,12,Roy,He-
3871,2,12,Randy Marsh,--thing will work out.
3872,2,12,Roy,Hello?
3873,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Maybe. I guess it's my turn. Truth or Dare?
3874,2,12,Roy,Sharon?
3875,2,12,Randy Marsh,[Sensually.] Dare.
3876,2,12,Sharon Marsh,Do me. Right here in the clubhouse.
3877,2,12,Roy,Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?
3878,2,12,Stan Marsh,Wow. Clubhouses are magical.
3879,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Okay. It's my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?
3880,2,12,Stan Marsh,Dare.
3881,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.
3882,2,12,Stan Marsh,...What?!
3883,2,12,Wendy Testaburger,"Wow, that sucks!"
3884,2,12,Bebe Stevens,Do you think it'll hurt?
3885,2,12,Roy,"Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?"
3886,2,13,Host,"Well, Tom and Mary, you've made it to the final round. Are you ready to play for the grand prize?"
3887,2,13,Tom and Mary,"We're ready, Bob!"
3888,2,13,Bob,Any particular prize you're hoping for?
3889,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Well, Hawaii's nice, but Tahiti would be fun, too!"
3890,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Oh, anywhere'd be great!"
3891,2,13,Bob,Polynesian diggities. I wish you luck. Here we go. What is the thin flap of skin that runs from the base of the penis to the scrotum?
3892,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Oh. Oh wait wait, I know this."
3893,2,13,Tom and Mary,The upper vascular hood.
3894,2,13,Bob,"I'm sorry, but YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!"
3895,2,13,Bob,Fred tell 'em what they've won.
3896,2,13,Fred the Announcer,"Tom and Mary, put on your cowboy hats, because you're going to beautiful South Park, Colorado!"
3897,2,13,Tom and Mary,Where?
3898,2,13,Fred the Announcer,"That's right, just in time for Cows Days, the world's 45th biggest rodeo and carnival."
3899,2,13,Fred the Announcer,"Every fall, South Park celebrates Cow Days, and you're gonna be a part of it. You'll stay at the fabulous Super 7 hotel on Bernhardt Road, and enjoy festivities, including prizes, rides, and of course, the world-famous Running of the Cows!"
3900,2,13,Fred the Announcer,"Congratulations, Tom and Mary."
3901,2,13,Bob,"Well, Tom, Mary, you must be very excited."
3902,2,13,Tom and Mary,What was second prize again?
3903,2,13,Bob,That's all for now. See you tomorrow on...
3904,2,13,Bob and Audience,"Ooo, What The Hell Is That!"
3905,2,13,Tom and Mary,Ah shit!
3906,2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to kick off the 14th Annual South Park Cow Days!"
3907,2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"As most of you know, Cow Days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow."
3908,2,13,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, the chairman of Cow Days, Jimbo Kern!"
3909,2,13,Jimbo Kern,This year is a very special Cow Days because we are revealing our all-new Cow Memorial!
3910,2,13,Jimbo Kern,Which will live forever in South Park from this day forward. Release the curtain!
3911,2,13,Tom and Mary,This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen!
3912,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Now, Mary, this is our only vacation for years. We have to make the best of it."
3913,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Oh you're right. I'm sorry, honey. We just need to stay positive."
3914,2,13,Mayor McDaniels,Now get out to the carnival and enjoy the amazing rides and the wonderful games!
3915,2,13,Toss a Ball Operator,"Hey, come on over here, kids. Win fabulous prizes."
3916,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, dude, check it out! We can win Terrance and Phillip dolls."
3917,2,13,Stan Marsh,Are those REAL Terrance and Phillip dolls? They look all crappy.
3918,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, they look like cheap rip-offs."
3919,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Sure they're real. They're even made in Canada.
3920,2,13,Stan Marsh,Really?
3921,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Yeah, look. They're even signed by Terrance and Phillip themselves."
3922,2,13,Eric Cartman,Wwow!
3923,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that kicks ass!"
3924,2,13,Eric Cartman,"[Breathlessly.] Oh, dude, I gotta win those. How much to play?"
3925,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Five dollars for three balls.
3926,2,13,Eric Cartman,Five dollars?! Jesus Christ!
3927,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Don't worry, kid, it's easy. You just gotta put one ball through Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth."
3928,2,13,Eric Cartman,That's easy!
3929,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Okay, we've got a player!"
3930,2,13,Eric Cartman,Ay! Check it out!
3931,2,13,Eric Cartman,Damn it!
3932,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"It's okay, son, you've still got two balls to try and get through her yapper."
3933,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Take this, Jennifer Love Hewitt!"
3934,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You suck, Cartman!"
3935,2,13,Eric Cartman,I'd like to see you do better!
3936,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Give me that!
3937,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! It hit her right in the mouth!
3938,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,It's gotta go through her mouth.
3939,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,But ih-
3940,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Sorry, kid, try again. Just five more dollars."
3941,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Here, give me some money, Cartman!"
3942,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Lend me money, fat boy!"
3943,2,13,Eric Cartman,"I only have three dollars left, asshole!"
3944,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it! Come on! I'll try to get more money from my mom.
3945,2,13,Jimbo Kern,"[Still onstage.] Okay, everybody! It's time for the Running of the Cows!"
3946,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, give me some money!"
3947,2,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, what are you doing here?! This is very dangerous!"
3948,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,I need $17 so we can win Terrance and Phillip dolls.
3949,2,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, get back into the carnival this instant! You can't be out on the streets!"
3950,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,I will if you give me money!
3951,2,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Okay, here!"
3952,2,13,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
3953,2,13,Jimbo Kern,"Okay, everybody, okay. Settle down. Now I know you're all anxious to get to the Running of the Cows, BUT, let me remind you: those brave souls who have decided to run against the cows through town do so at their own risk. I don't think I have to remind you that three people died in last year's Running of the Cows."
3954,2,13,Jimbo Kern,"With that said, let's rock and roll!"
3955,2,13,Jimbo Kern,Everybody ready to run? Release the cows!
3956,2,13,Jimbo Kern,They're loose!
3957,2,13,Cows,Mooooo?!
3958,2,13,Ned Gerblansky,Ow.
3959,2,13,Jimbo Kern,[Running by.] Yeehaw!
3960,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Okay. We've got $15 between us. That means we get nine balls to throw.
3961,2,13,Eric Cartman,"I only need one, dude. I only need one."
3962,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Come one, come all. Get in line now, for the Chamber of Farts."
3963,2,13,Stan Marsh,What's that?
3964,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
3965,2,13,Eric Cartman,How much is it?
3966,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Just three tickets, boys."
3967,2,13,Chamber of Farts Ride,Dare you enter the Chamber of Farts?
3968,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Is it like a- haunted house or something?
3969,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Sure. It's veery scary.
3970,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Let's see: each ticket is a dollar, so three tickets is like two twenty-five."
3971,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No. We can't, dude. We have to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
3972,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Oh come on, you guys. We'll still have plenty of money left over."
3973,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You'd better be right, dude."
3974,2,13,Eric Cartman,I'm right!
3975,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Keep your hands inside at all times.
3976,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
3977,2,13,Chamber of Farts Ride,"So, the Chamber of Farts has another victim, eh? Don't be afraid. There aren't any ghouls here, only FARTS!"
3978,2,13,Eric Cartman,Eh! God-damnit!
3979,2,13,Stan Marsh,What the hell was that?
3980,2,13,Chamber of Farts Ride,Perhaps you need some MORE FARTS!
3981,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"All right, boys. Ride's over."
3982,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,That was the dumbest ride I've ever seen!
3983,2,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah. What the hell kind of carnival company are you?!
3984,2,13,Eric Cartman,[As they step down.] I don't know what you guys are talking about! That scared the crap out of me!
3985,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"That was a waste of money, Cartman!"
3986,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Hey, if you guys want a great ride, get in this line. It's only seven tickets."
3987,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,We can't. We're saving our money for the balls in Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth game.
3988,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, will you relax, you pink eye? We have plenty of money."
3989,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you guys! It'll be sweet!"
3990,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,This ride better be good!
3991,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, this line is way too long!"
3992,2,13,Eric Cartman,I think we're almost to the end.
3993,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,We'd better be. We've been in line for almost an hour!
3994,2,13,Stan Marsh,Here we go.
3995,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Finally!
3996,2,13,Line Ride Operator,Did ya enjoy the ride?
3997,2,13,Stan Marsh,What ride?
3998,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
3999,2,13,Line Ride Operator,"This was the Line Ride, a real live simulator of a long line."
4000,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Ugh. You've gotta be kidding me!
4001,2,13,Line Ride Operator,"That's five tickets, thank you very much."
4002,2,13,Line Ride Operator,Come see us again soon.
4003,2,13,Stan Marsh,My ass we will!
4004,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Cartman, this is just my opinion, but I think the Line Ride sucked donkey balls!"
4005,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, let's not ride that ride again."
4006,2,13,Photo Seller,Would you like to buy a photo of you boys enjoying the Line Ride?
4007,2,13,Eric Cartman,How much?
4008,2,13,Photo Seller,Just three dollars.
4009,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Hunh that's, that's pretty sweet."
4010,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You dumbass, Cartman!"
4011,2,13,Eric Cartman,What? This is cool.
4012,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's not cool!"
4013,2,13,Eric Cartman,"It is, too!"
4014,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Can I help you boys.
4015,2,13,Stan Marsh,We're gonna try to win those Terrance and Phillip dolls again.
4016,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"O-kay, five dollars for three balls."
4017,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"How much do we have left, Cartman?"
4018,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"How much do we have left, Cartman?!"
4019,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Aah, three dollars."
4020,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What?! You said we had plenty of money, Cartman!"
4021,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but I didn't take into account the fact that I suck at math."
4022,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,You son of a bitch! Aaargh!
4023,2,13,Eric Cartman,Ey! Seriously!
4024,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Cartman, thanks to you we don't have any money left to win the Terrance and Phillip dolls!"
4025,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry!"
4026,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, sorry's not good enough! What are you gonna do about it?"
4027,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Thinks a moment.] Hey! I bet Kenny has some food stamps on him!
4028,2,13,Kenny McCormick,[Pulls some out.] (What? These?)
4029,2,13,Stan Marsh,Sir? Will you take food stamps for three balls?
4030,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Sure, as long as they're good."
4031,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Give him your food stamps, Kenny!"
4032,2,13,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh uh.)
4033,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dude! I can do it! I'm sure!"
4034,2,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, these are my fucking food stamps! How am I going to eat without all these food stamps?)"
4035,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Damn it, Kenny, don't be such a food-stamp hog! Share with the rest of your friends!"
4036,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Okay. Here we go.
4037,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hey! That was right on target.
4038,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Sorry, kid. Try again."
4039,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,That does it! Shenanigans!
4040,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,SHENANIGANS!
4041,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Uhwhat are you doing?
4042,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm declaring Shenanigans on you! This game is rigged!
4043,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Shenanigans?
4044,2,13,Officer Barbrady,What's all the hoo-ha?
4045,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Officer Barbrady, I wanna declare Shenanigans on this carnival operator."
4046,2,13,Officer Barbrady,Why?
4047,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,This game is fixed! The balls are bigger than Jennifer Love Hewitt's mouth!
4048,2,13,Officer Barbrady,"If that is true, then your declaration of Shenanigans is just."
4049,2,13,Officer Barbrady,"What do you have to say, carnival operator?"
4050,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Look, the kid was really close. He still has another ball left. Leh let's try again, son."
4051,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,Here you go.
4052,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"There, you see? We have a winner!"
4053,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,It worked!
4054,2,13,Officer Barbrady,"Young man, you can't just go declaring Shenanigans on innocent people! That's how wars get started!"
4055,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Sorry, Officer Buttbaby."
4056,2,13,Officer Barbrady,Barbrady!
4057,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say?"
4058,2,13,Officer Barbrady,You said Buttbaby.
4059,2,13,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
4060,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Okay, kid, you won. You get to pick between the Barbie Pocket Mirror and the Bon Jovi Toothpick."
4061,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,No! Dude! I want the Terrance and Phillip dolls up there.
4062,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"Oh, nonono, you gotta win seven times to earn those."
4063,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
4064,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"You win seven Bon Jovi toothpicks, then you can trade 'em in for the Terrance and Phillip dolls."
4065,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You dirty son of a bitch, you never told us that we had to win-"
4066,2,13,Toss-A-Ball Operator,"[Ignoring them, speaking to the crowd] Step on up, just five dollars to play!"
4067,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Damnit, I have to have those dolls!"
4068,2,13,Stan Marsh,This is hopeless. We're never gonna have enough money to win.
4069,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[Something stops him.] Wait a minute! I've got it! The bull-riding contest. Cartman could ride a bull, and try to win $5,000."
4070,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Think about it, dude: $5,000. That's 1,000 set of balls. That's 3,000 balls! We'd have to win enough to get the dolls!"
4071,2,13,Eric Cartman,What the hell makes you think Cartman rides a bull?
4072,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[Grabbing Cartman by the collar.] Because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides, fatass! Now, either you're getting on a bull or I'm gonna break your fucking head open!"
4073,2,13,Eric Cartman,"O-kay, I'll get on the bull."
4074,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"All right! Now, come on! We have to practice!"
4075,2,13,Stan Marsh,[To Cartman.] He really wants those dolls.
4076,2,13,Eric Cartman,"I guess, damn!"
4077,2,13,Tom and Mary,That ride wasn't very good.
4078,2,13,Tom and Mary,"Now, Mary, you promised me we'd try to have a good time."
4079,2,13,Tom and Mary,"You're right. I'm sorry, honey, I'll try and have a good time."
4080,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Alright, this mechanical bull's gonna help you practice for the real thing, Cartman."
4081,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Hey, this is sweet."
4082,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You gotta try and stay on for ten seconds. Okay, Cartman?"
4083,2,13,Eric Cartman,I'll try. Ten seconds is a long time.
4084,2,13,Stan Marsh,We'll start on the slowest setting and work our way up. Ready? Go.
4085,2,13,Eric Cartman,Ye-gah!
4086,2,13,Eric Cartman,Ow!
4087,2,13,Eric Cartman,Son of a bitch!
4088,2,13,Stan Marsh,How long was that?
4089,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,That wasn't quite ten seconds.
4090,2,13,Stan Marsh,Damn it!
4091,2,13,Stan Marsh,"That wasn't ten seconds, Cartman. You have to do better than that."
4092,2,13,Eric Cartman,"[Whispering.] You guys, eh seriously, my back!"
4093,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Get back on, fat-ass! You have to practice!"
4094,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Whispering.] Seriously. Help.
4095,2,13,Eric Cartman,Screw you guys. Hate you guys.
4096,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What'd you say, Cartman??"
4097,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Whispering.] I hate you guys!
4098,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,I think he said he wants to practice on a real bull.
4099,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Whispering.] Hate you guys.
4100,2,13,Rancher,"Be careful with old Bob here. He ain't much for a-ridin' anymore, but he's all I got."
4101,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Well uh, he'll have to do. Cartman has to get some practice with a real bull."
4102,2,13,Rancher,"Well, have fun, boys."
4103,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, Cartman. You ready?"
4104,2,13,Eric Cartman,[Hesitantly.] Nnoo.
4105,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Open the gate!
4106,2,13,Eric Cartman,"All right, get down. This is my kind of bull-ride."
4107,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,[Whispers to Stan.] That bull sucks! He's not even bucking or anything!
4108,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this is sweet!"
4109,2,13,Stan Marsh,What are you going to do?
4110,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hit the bull in the balls with a snowball.
4111,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah. That's a good idea."
4112,2,13,Eric Cartman,Eeyy!
4113,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,That's better.
4114,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Hold on, Cartman!"
4115,2,13,Eric Cartman,"Ey! Seriously, you guys! Do something! Dude, stop this crazy thing!"
4116,2,13,Eric Cartman,Mother f-
4117,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Get up, Cartman! You're still not staying on long enough!"
4118,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Come on, Cartman."
4119,2,13,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh my God, they've killed Cartman!)"
4120,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No he didn't kill him, he's still breathing!"
4121,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Get up!
4122,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Get UP!
4123,2,13,Stan Marsh,"You okay, dude?"
4124,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, hello? Hel-lo?"
4125,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I think we broke him."
4126,2,13,Dr Doctor,"Boys, I'm afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma."
4127,2,13,Stan Marsh,What's the matter with him.
4128,2,13,Dr Doctor,"Well, apparently, he thinks he's a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li."
4129,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,..Oh.
4130,2,13,Stan Marsh,But can he still ride a bull?
4131,2,13,Dr Doctor,What?
4132,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,We need him to win a bull-riding contest so we can get Terrance and Phillip dolls. Can he still do it?
4133,2,13,Dr Doctor,"No, boys! You need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep."
4134,2,13,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it!
4135,2,13,Stan Marsh,"Cartman. Cartman, can you hear me?"
4136,2,14,Eric Cartman,"[Singing.] 
Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches
Stinky, stinky britches,
you got stinky--"
4137,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell are you singing, Cartman?"
4138,2,14,Eric Cartman,"This new song by Alanis Morissette. I cant get it out of my head. 
Stinky britches,
you got stinky britches"
4139,2,14,Mr Garrison,"[Passes by.] Hello, children. Ready for lunch?"
4140,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Stinky britches,
you got stinky,
stinky--"
4141,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Eric, is there a problem?"
4142,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I cant get this stupid song out of my head."
4143,2,14,Mr Garrison,"""Stinky Britches"" by Alanis Morissette?"
4144,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. 
Stinky,
stinky britches"
4145,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Children, did you say hi to Mr. Twig?"
4146,2,14,Mr Twig,"Hi, boys. How are you?"
4147,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,When is Mr. Hat coming back?
4148,2,14,Mr Garrison,[Pause.] I told you never say his name in my presence.
4149,2,14,Stan Marsh,But we hate Mr. Twig. Mr. Twig sucks.
4150,2,14,Kid,Yeah.
4151,2,14,Eric Cartman,"[Quietly to himself.] 
Stinky britches,
you got stinky--"
4152,2,14,Mr Garrison,"It just so happens that Mr. Twig is far more stable than Mr. Hat could ever be, so he's the better puppet now--"
4153,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,He'd be better used as a coat rack.
4154,2,14,Mr Garrison,"[Livid.] How dare you! Come on, Mr. Twig."
4155,2,14,Chef,"Hello there, children."
4156,2,14,Boys,"Hey, Chef."
4157,2,14,Eric Cartman,"You got stinky britches,
stinky--"
4158,2,14,Chef,What did you say?
4159,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,He singing some new hit song.
4160,2,14,Chef,"Eric, where did you hear that song?"
4161,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Its all over the place. On the radio, MTV, everywhere."
4162,2,14,Chef,"[Softly.] Well, I'll be sodomized on Christmas."
4163,2,14,Stan Marsh,"What, dude?"
4164,2,14,Chef,"Children, I wrote that song 20 years ago."
4165,2,14,Eric Cartman,You wrote it?
4166,2,14,Chef,Yeah. Back when I used to be in the rock business. And now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs.
4167,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, then you should get money for it!"
4168,2,14,Chef,"Aww, I don't want any money. I just like to see my name on the credits, that's all."
4169,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Then we should go to the record company. My dad's a lawyer, dude; he tells me about this stuff all the time."
4170,2,14,Chef,"Well, all right. Maybe I will go. Ill play them my version of the song."
4171,2,14,Chef recording,"Stinky britches,
you got those stinky britches."
4172,2,14,Chef,"So you see, Mr. Big Record Producer, ""Stinky Britches"" was something I wrote several years ago."
4173,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,"Hmm I really so no resemblance between that song and ""Stinky Britches"" by our artist, Alanis Morissette."
4174,2,14,Chef,Huh?
4175,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Its the same goddamn song!
4176,2,14,Chef,"Now, look, Im trying to be cool about this, but you just can't rip people's music off! It's against the law!"
4177,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,I am above the law!
4178,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,"Mr. Chef, Im afraid you leave me no alternative. Were going to sue you."
4179,2,14,Chef,"Sue me?! You stole one of my songs, and youre gonna sue me?"
4180,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,Yes. I suggest you get a real good lawyer. Well have the best in the business.
4181,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Well get my dad to be Chefs lawyer!
4182,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and hes Jewish."
4183,2,14,Alanis Morissette,"Stinky,
stinky britches,
stinky britches"
4184,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Twig, is that you?"
4185,2,14,Mr Garrison,Mis-Mr. Twig?
4186,2,14,Mr Garrison,Aagghh!! Mr. Twig! No!
4187,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Who did this to you, Mr. Twig?! Who?!"
4188,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, just let me do all the talking, Chef. Were gonna bring these bastards down."
4189,2,14,Chef,Right.
4190,2,14,Judge Moses,This court is now in session. Who's representing the defense?
4191,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,"I am, Your Honor. Gerald Broflovski."
4192,2,14,Judge Moses,And representing the prosecution?
4193,2,14,Prosecutor,"I am, Your Honor."
4194,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,Uh-oh.
4195,2,14,Chef,"Why ""uh-oh""?"
4196,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,"Chef, that's Johnnie Cochran. He's the guy who knocked O.J. off."
4197,2,14,Chef,Uh-oh.
4198,2,14,Mr Garrison,I need some help over here! Please help! I think he's got third-degree burns!
4199,2,14,Dr Doctor,Give the child to me.
4200,2,14,Mr Garrison,"[Panicked.] Is he going to be all right, doctor?"
4201,2,14,Dr Doctor,Uhhh...
4202,2,14,Mr Garrison,Is he going to live?
4203,2,14,Dr Doctor,[Slowly.] It's a stick.
4204,2,14,Mr Garrison,"...Dammit, don't give me that medical jargon! Just tell me straight, is he going to be okay?!"
4205,2,14,Reporter,"And so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the...day, Johnnie Cochran has appeared to defend Capitalist Records. The question now is, will Cochran use his famous ""Chewbacca defense""?"
4206,2,14,Eric Cartman,"What's a ""Chewbacca defense""?"
4207,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
4208,2,14,Stan Marsh,That's what Cochran used in the O.J. Simpson trial.
4209,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Goddamn, I hate that Cochran guy! If he was in front of me, I'd be like, ""Hey! You stupid son of a bitch! You-- How... How'd you like me to kick you in the nuts?!"""
4210,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, Cartman."
4211,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,"...And so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago. You've heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month. I'd say it's pretty much an open-and-shut case. Make the right decision. Thank you."
4212,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,[To Chef] We've got 'em.
4213,2,14,Judge Moses,"Mr. Johnnie Cochran, your closing arguments."
4214,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, Chef's attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote ""Stinky Britches"" ten years ago, and they make a good case... hell, I almost felt pity myself. But, ladies and gentlemen, of this supposed jury, I have one, final thing I want you to consider."
4215,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,"Ladies and gentleman, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookie from the planet Kashyyyk. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about that. That does not make sense."
4216,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,Dammit..!
4217,2,14,Chef,What?
4218,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,Hes using the Chewbacca defense.
4219,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,"Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: ""What does this have to do with this case?"" Nothing."
4220,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,"Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! It does not make sense! Look at me, I'm a lawyer defending a major record company, and I'm talkin' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does it make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests."
4221,2,14,Judge Moses,"[After a long pause.] O-kay, then."
4222,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Wow, hes good."
4223,2,14,Reporter,"In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense."
4224,2,14,Reporter,Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.
4225,2,14,Judge Moses,How find you the jury?
4226,2,14,Foreman,"We find the defendant, Jerome ""Chef"" McElroy... guilty as charged."
4227,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,Whoops.
4228,2,14,Chef,Whoops?!
4229,2,14,Judge Moses,"Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label. The full fee of two million dollars will be handed over within 24 hours."
4230,2,14,Chef,Do I look like I have two million?
4231,2,14,Judge Moses,"Well, you have 24 hours to find it, or else you have to go to jail. For eight million years."
4232,2,14,Bailiff,"Uh, it's actually for four years."
4233,2,14,Judge Moses,"Oh, sorry. You'll got to jail for four years."
4234,2,14,Chef,This can't be happening..!
4235,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no, dude. Chef's gonna go to jail."
4236,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,"And that chair, too. I want that chair."
4237,2,14,Chef,"Hey, that's my favorite chair!"
4238,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,"You heard the judge. Since you lost the case, I can seize whatever I want to pay my legal fees. Yeah, take that water cooler, too."
4239,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Hello there, Chef."
4240,2,14,Chef,"Hey, children."
4241,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,What's going on?
4242,2,14,Chef,"Children, that record company guy is takin' all my belongings. And if I don't come up with two million, I'm going to jail."
4243,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Well, don't worry. We came over to cheer you up."
4244,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Ready, Cartman?"
4245,2,14,Eric Cartman,Ready.
4246,2,14,Eric Cartman,"I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la
I hope my will enjoy my dance
Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay
Would you like some sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut--"
4247,2,14,Chef,"Okay, okay, children, thank you very much. I feel much better."
4248,2,14,Stan Marsh,You do?
4249,2,14,Chef,Sure. Just please stop.
4250,2,14,Eric Cartman,[Putting his coat back on.] See? I told you guys it would work.
4251,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"What's that, dude?"
4252,2,14,Chef,This? This is my photo album of all my times in the rock business.
4253,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Did you ever know any famous people?
4254,2,14,Chef,"Did I? Janis Joplin, The Beatles, Elton John... I got to travel all around the world, hanging out with bands, going to lavish parties, lovin' many, many women."
4255,2,14,Eric Cartman,What's that?
4256,2,14,Chef,Nothing.
4257,2,14,Chef,Anyway--
4258,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,"Take this, too."
4259,2,14,Chef,Hey! That has no monetary value! What the hell are you taking that for?!
4260,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,I can take whatever I want.
4261,2,14,Chef,But I have 24 hours to come up with your money! That's the law!
4262,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,I am above the law!
4263,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,I told you not to mess with me.
4264,2,14,Chef,"That does it. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna raise that two million, but I'm not going to use it to pay you back. I'm going to use it to hire Johnnie Cochran myself and sue you!"
4265,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,[Gasps.] You wouldnt.
4266,2,14,Chef,Watch me. Now get the fudge out of my house!
4267,2,14,Mr Garrison,"I brought you some more juice, Mr. Twig. Are you feeling any better? [Sighs.] I don't know who would want to hurt you like this, but I promise nobody will ever hurt you again, ever. [Senses something wrong.] Mist-Mr. Twig... are you okay? Mist-Mr. Twig..?"
4268,2,14,Mr Garrison,Aaaggghhh!!
4269,2,14,Mr Garrison,Who did this?!
4270,2,14,Mr Garrison,"You won't get away with this, you bastards!"
4271,2,14,Chef,"Okay. Thank you, Mr. Cochran. [Hangs up.] Well, Johnnie Cochran will take my case if I can pay his legal fee, $2 million."
4272,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Hey, why don't you ask all those famous people you used to know for money? They're rich."
4273,2,14,Chef,"Oh, they wouldn't remember me. All I did was cook for them."
4274,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You can raise $2 million, dude. We'll help you."
4275,2,14,Chef,"I appreciate that, children, but raising $2 million is not an easy thing to do."
4276,2,14,Chef,My only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.
4277,2,14,Chef,"Wish me luck, children."
4278,2,14,Stan Marsh,"We've gotta help him, dude."
4279,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, b-but how?"
4280,2,14,Stan Marsh,Come on. Maybe those rock stars will remember Chef. Let's go pay them a visit!
4281,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, dude, this house is huge."
4282,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's bigger than Cartman's ass."
4283,2,14,Eric Cartman,"No, it isn't, you guys."
4284,2,14,Butler,Can I help you?
4285,2,14,Eric Cartman,"We're trying to raise money for our friend, Chef."
4286,2,14,Eric Cartman,Would you like a Moon Crunchie or a Snacky Cake?
4287,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Are you Elton John?
4288,2,14,Bulter,"No, Im one of his butlers."
4289,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. Then what the hell are we talking to you for? Come on, guys."
4290,2,14,Hi,Dialog
4291,2,14,are you Elton John,Dialog
4292,2,14,Elton John,"Sir Elton John. I was knighted, you know."
4293,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,We're trying to raise money for our school chef.
4294,2,14,Eric Cartman,We have Chocolate Nuggies and S'more Crunchies...
4295,2,14,Elton John,"I'm sorry, but I'm not a big candy bar fan."
4296,2,14,Eric Cartman,What?!
4297,2,14,Stan Marsh,Could you just buy a couple anyway? Our friend Chef is really--
4298,2,14,Elton John,Chef? You mean Chef-Chef?
4299,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude."
4300,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Wow, you remember him?"
4301,2,14,Elton John,Of course. I haven't seen him for so long. I remember when I first met him. It was about 25 years ago.
4302,2,14,Elton John,I was a struggling musician who couldn't get a break.
4303,2,14,Elton John,"Oh, oh, you're my cheddar cheese girl
You're soft but firm,
and you go well with wine.
Oh oh, cheddar cheese girl
Cheddar, cheddar cheese girl"
4304,2,14,Man,Boo!
4305,2,14,Chef,"Hey, Elton, don't feel so down, baby. Have some of my Scottish haggis. It'll cheer you up."
4306,2,14,Elton John,"Thanks, Chef. I just don't understand what my music is missing."
4307,2,14,Chef,"Look, Elton, you are a great singer, but a retarded monkey could write better lyrics."
4308,2,14,Elton John,"I really thought I had it this time with ""Cheddar Cheese Girl""."
4309,2,14,Chef,What you need is a guy to write really good lyrics for you. I know a guy named Bernie Taupin who's working at Moth Burger right now. I'll give him a call.
4310,2,14,Elton John,That's a great idea!
4311,2,14,Chef,"And, Elton, why don't you get yourself some new threads? You know, some slick glasses and shit."
4312,2,14,Elton John,"And so I got Bernie to write my lyrics. And if it wasn't for Chef, I would never have had a career in music."
4313,2,14,Stan Marsh,So will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
4314,2,14,Elton John,"Yes, of course. I'll buy three Crispy Yum Yums."
4315,2,14,Eric Cartman,Three Crispy Yum Yums.
4316,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Elton, if I give you these lyrics, will you write a song for my girlfriend, Wendy?"
4317,2,14,Elton John,"Sure, kid. But I would retain exclusive worldwide rights, [Rushing.] including-but-not-limited-to-Asian-territories, with-a-twenty-percent-commission-from-all-domestic-sales, and-sole-ownership-of-any-and-all-publishing."
4318,2,14,Stan Marsh,[Unsure.] 'Kay.
4319,2,14,Elton John,Tell Chef I said hi.
4320,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Thanks, dude."
4321,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we'll have Chef's $2 million in no time!"
4322,2,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Oy..! Thank you, Chef."
4323,2,14,Chef,"No problem, Ms. Broflovski. Uhh, now, about that hundred bucks?"
4324,2,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, of course!"
4325,2,14,Sheila Broflovski,Here you go.
4326,2,14,Sheila Broflovski,Leaving so soon?
4327,2,14,Chef,I have a loooooong way to go to raise the kind of money I need.
4328,2,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, best of luck to you, then."
4329,2,14,Gerald Broflovski,"How was it, honey?"
4330,2,14,Sheila Broflovski,Pretty much what I expected.
4331,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Hello, are you Meat Loaf?"
4332,2,14,Meat Loaf,Yeah. What the hell do you want?
4333,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Loaf, we are selling candy bars for our dying friend."
4334,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hes not dying, Cartman!"
4335,2,14,Eric Cartman,"[Whispers.] Shut your goddamn mouth. [To Meat Loaf.] We have Nilla Crunchies, Berry Bars--"
4336,2,14,Meat Loaf,What's this for?
4337,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Our friend, Chef."
4338,2,14,Meat Loaf,Chef's in trouble?
4339,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Do you know him?
4340,2,14,Meat Loaf,Do I?
4341,2,14,Cous Cous,Nobody came again.
4342,2,14,Chef,"There, there, Cous-Cous. It'll be all right. Maybe you just need to change your image."
4343,2,14,Cous Cous,What do you mean?
4344,2,14,Chef,"Nobody wants to see a guy named Cous-Cous. You need a big, strong beefy name."
4345,2,14,Cous Cous,"Beefy? Like, uhh Tri-tip!"
4346,2,14,Chef,"That's not bad. Here, have some meat loaf."
4347,2,14,Meat Loaf,I owe everything to Chef.
4348,2,14,Stan Marsh,Wow! So you'll help him?
4349,2,14,Meat Loaf,You bet. Give me a box of Nilla Yum Yums and a couple of Berry Bars.
4350,2,14,Boys,Cool!
4351,2,14,Ms Crabtree,"All right, let's get this show on the road! Come here, baby!"
4352,2,14,Chef,"Uh-uh, hold on a second, Ms. Crabtree. How would you like to use some... sex toys?"
4353,2,14,Ms Crabtree,Sex toys? Like what?
4354,2,14,Chef,Like this very special device.
4355,2,14,Chef,"I call it ""Chefs pleasure bag""."
4356,2,14,Ms Crabtree,How does it work?
4357,2,14,Chef,"Now, all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure."
4358,2,14,Ms Crabtree,"Really? Well, hell, let's give it a shot."
4359,2,14,Chef,"Ahh, yeah. That's much better."
4360,2,14,Rick James,Sure. I'll do anything for Chef. Give me a box of those Choco-Numbers.
4361,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Gosh, thanks, Rick James."
4362,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, thanks. [To Kyle as they walk away.] Thats $35. Come on, you guys, we've gotta hurry and give this money to Chef!"
4363,2,14,Mayor McDaniels,"Ohh, that was wonderful, Chef. Good show."
4364,2,14,Chef,[Exhausted.] I can't keep doing this. It's killing me.
4365,2,14,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, come on, buck up, little fella."
4366,2,14,Chef,I'm serious! I'm not gonna make it.
4367,2,14,Mayor McDaniels,"Sure you are, Chef. I'll give a hundred more for another romp."
4368,2,14,Mayor McDaniels,"Aw, hell!"
4369,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Thank you for coming, Officer Barbrady."
4370,2,14,Officer Barbrady,What's this all about?
4371,2,14,Mr Garrison,"These pictures just arrived. [Opens envelope.] I set up a camera, and caught Mr. Twig's assailant red-handed. [Pulls out the pictures.] Now, go arrest him!"
4372,2,14,Mr Garrison,What?
4373,2,14,Officer Barbrady,Can I go now?
4374,2,14,Mr Garrison,"YesYes, Im sorry."
4375,2,14,Officer Barbrady,[Leaves.] Weirdo.
4376,2,14,Mr Garrison,[Examining the pictures] It can't be. These can't be right.
4377,2,14,Mr Garrison,Mr. Hat!
4378,2,14,Stan Marsh,Wait! Wait! What are you doing?
4379,2,14,Chef,"It's over, children. I couldn't raise the $2 million to hire Johnnie Cochran. Now I have to go to jail."
4380,2,14,Stan Marsh,"No, you don't!"
4381,2,14,Chef,Huh?
4382,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,We went to a bunch of rock stars and sold them candy bars to raise the money you needed.
4383,2,14,Chef,Did what?! Wow! How much did you make?
4384,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman?
4385,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, you can see here that we raised approximately $95, falling well short of our $2 million goal illustrated hyeeah."
4386,2,14,Chef,[Dejected.] Oh.
4387,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,But we can put our money together with the money you made whoring yourself to all the women. How much did you make?
4388,2,14,Chef,"I made about $410,300, but--"
4389,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,"That doesn't matter, because that money belongs to me!"
4390,2,14,Stan Marsh,You can't take Chef's money! It's illeg--!
4391,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,I am above the law!
4392,2,14,Officer Barbrady,"All right, you, it's time to go."
4393,2,14,Chef,"Goodbye, children. Thanks for all your help."
4394,2,14,Officer Barbrady,Let's go.
4395,2,14,Chef,Ow! What the hell did you do that for?!
4396,2,14,Officer Barbrady,"I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to do mine."
4397,2,14,Chef,Ow! Ow!
4398,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Dude... Chef is gone.
4399,2,14,Stan Marsh,No more Chef.
4400,2,14,Eric Cartman,[Voice breaking.] No more Salisbury steak and... pecan pie. [He starts sobbing.]
4401,2,14,Stan Marsh,"We can't let him down, you guys."
4402,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's over. He's gone."
4403,2,14,Stan Marsh,No! Chef wouldn't give up on us. How many times has Chef gotten us out of trouble?
4404,2,14,Eric Cartman,Four.
4405,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,But what are we gonna do?
4406,2,14,Stan Marsh,"It's easy, dude. Chef Aid."
4407,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Chef Aid?
4408,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. We set up a stage, and have Cartman do the German Dance. Then we charge people for tickets."
4409,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, that's a great idea!"
4410,2,14,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
4411,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Did you think I would just take you back? Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don't look at me like that, Mr. Hat. Remember, you're the one that left."
4412,2,14,Mr Garrison,I'm not going to take you back.
4413,2,14,Mr Garrison,You can just go to hell! You go to hell and you die!
4414,2,14,Mr Garrison,"You are a lying bowl of turd, Mr. Hat!"
4415,2,14,Mr Garrison,"...I hope you starve, you lousy son of a bitch!"
4416,2,14,Mr Garrison,What are you all looking at? This is just between me and Mr. Hat.
4417,2,14,Dr Doctor,"It's over, Mr. Garrison. This is it. We had enough."
4418,2,14,Mr Garrison,What do you mean?
4419,2,14,Officer Barbrady,"I'm afraid it's the big house for you, fruitcake."
4420,2,14,Mr Garrison,What? Jail?
4421,2,14,Eric Cartman,"I will do the German dance for you
It's fun and gay and tra-la-la"
4422,2,14,Eric Cartman,"I hope my will enjoy my dance,"
4423,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Fiddle-e-aye, fiddle-e-aye ay"
4424,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,Hmm... This isn't going over so well.
4425,2,14,Stan Marsh,"[To Kyle.] Cartman just needs to put more into it. [To Cartman] Dance better, Cartman!"
4426,2,14,Eric Cartman,"[Faster.] 
Would you like sauerkraut,
German boy,
German boy?
Yes, I'd like some sauerkraut,
Frulein Setski."
4427,2,14,Elton John,"Howdy ho, boys."
4428,2,14,Stan Marsh,Elton John! What are you doing here?
4429,2,14,Elton John,It occurred to me that you might need some more help raising money for Chef.
4430,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Boy, do we!"
4431,2,14,Elton John,"So I called a few friends, and we all decided to come over."
4432,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, cool!"
4433,2,14,Elton John,I see you've got a stage all set up for us.
4434,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, it's all yours."
4435,2,14,Elton John,"Then, lets rock and roll! Or something similar."
4436,2,14,Cartman and Kenny,Hooray!
4437,2,14,Mr Garrison,"...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back. I mean, I care a lot about Mr. Twig, but Mr. Hat and I have so much history."
4438,2,14,Chef,"You finally snapped, huh, Garrison?"
4439,2,14,Mr Garrison,What?
4440,2,14,Chef,"Don't you get it, Garrison? It's all you! You're Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig! You've got split personality schizophrenic jeebies."
4441,2,14,Mr Garrison,"[Pause.] I warn you, Chef, don't even think of taking advantage of me in this prison cell."
4442,2,14,Chef,What?!
4443,2,14,Teen MC,"Okay, thanks for coming to Chef Aid, everybody! Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?!"
4444,2,14,Teen MC,Whoo!
4445,2,14,Teen MC,"All right, let's get things going with... Rancid! [Moves offstage and squeaks.] Ran-cid!"
4446,2,14,Rancid,California sun has sunk
4447,2,14,Rancid,"Behind the Anaheim Hills,
here it comes tonight"
4448,2,14,Rancid,I was hiiiiiigh on junk--
4449,2,14,Mr Garrison,"[Emotionless.] You're still aren't entertaining ideas of raping me in this prison cell, are you, Chef?"
4450,2,14,Chef,"No, Garrison! Shut the hell up!"
4451,2,14,Mr Garrison,That's good.
4452,2,14,Chef,What the?
4453,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Oh, boy, we're free!"
4454,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Wow, what a daring rescue."
4455,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Mr. Hat! Mr. Hat saved us, Chef!"
4456,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Come on, let's get in the truck! I'll drive from here, Mr. Hat."
4457,2,14,Chef,How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?
4458,2,14,Rick James,"[Vocalizing] 
Mmmmm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmm"
4459,2,14,Teen MC,"Rick James, ladies and gentlemen!"
4460,2,14,Rick James,"God bless you, Chef!"
4461,2,14,Teen MC,"And now here's your favorite band, Primus! Whoo!"
4462,2,14,Les Claypool,"We're damned proud to be here to support our good buddy, Chef. It was Chef who told us in the early days, to keep trying and to keep pursuing our dreams, no matter how much we sucked. I love that man."
4463,2,14,Mr Mackey,Whooaa..!
4464,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,What are you bastards doing?
4465,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,We are raising money so that Chef can hire Johnnie Cochran to sue you!
4466,2,14,Eric Cartman,Yeah! Now get out of here before I kick you in the nuts!
4467,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,"Oh, yeah? Well just see about this!"
4468,2,14,Teen MC,"And now, heres Joe Strummer!  Whoo!"
4469,2,14,Joe Strummer,"You know, when The Clash were on tour and we lost the beat, Chef would be like at the side of the stage going, ""Don't forget, pump your loins, children."" You know, that was like his motto or something."
4470,2,14,Teen MC,Whoo!
4471,2,14,Joe Strummer,"Well, it's a rockin' world
Make no mistake about it"
4472,2,14,Joe Strummer,It's a shocking world
4473,2,14,Joe Strummer,"Could be what's so great about it
It's a rockin' world..."
4474,2,14,Chef,What the hell is this?
4475,2,14,Everyone,"Welcome to Chef Aid, Chef!"
4476,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Wow! How'd you get out of jail, Chef?"
4477,2,14,Chef,"Mr. Hat busted me out. Children, did you do this?"
4478,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we helped."
4479,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Were gonna raise your money, Chef."
4480,2,14,Chef,I dont believe it!
4481,2,14,Mr Big Record Producer,Well just see how long this Chef Aid thing lasts.
4482,2,14,Teen MC,"And now, here he is TV's Ozzy Osbourne!"
4483,2,14,Ozzy Osbourne,"We're all here to help our good friend, Chef, who has touched our lives in the past."
4484,2,14,Ozzy Osbourne,"I remember when I was just starting out, Chef suggested I buy a pompadour hat. I thought he said, ""Bite the head off a bat"", so I did. And the rest, oh, it's just history. Now, let's go crazyyy!"
4485,2,14,Ozzy Osbourne,Ain't nowhere to run!
4486,2,14,Ozzy Osbourne,Ain't nowhere to hide!
4487,2,14,Ozzy Osbourne,Aarrggghhh!!!
4488,2,14,Kenny McCormick,"(All right dude, let me go now!)"
4489,2,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh, my God! Ozzy Osbourne bit Kennys head off!"
4490,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,You bastard!
4491,2,14,Teen MC,And now heres Ween!
4492,2,14,Dean Ween,We're thrilled to be part of Chef Aid.
4493,2,14,Gene Ween,Chef was the guy who told us to do a country album.
4494,2,14,Dean Ween,"No, dude, that was Steve's idea."
4495,2,14,Gene Ween,Oh. Then who's Chef?
4496,2,14,Dean Ween,"I don't know, dude. I thought you knew him."
4497,2,14,Gene Ween,"Oh, well. Anyways, here's our song!"
4498,2,14,Ween,"Many colors in the homo rainbow
Don't be afraid to let your colors shine shiiiiiiiiiiine"
4499,2,14,Mr Garrison,"Don't worry, Mr. Twig. Even though Mr. Hat rescued me from prison, I'm still going to stick with you."
4500,2,14,Mr Twig,[In a French accent.] Did you love him?
4501,2,14,Mr Garrison,It doesn't matter. He left me.
4502,2,14,Mr Twig,Did you love him?
4503,2,14,Mr Garrison,Yes.
4504,2,14,Mr Twig,Then run to him.
4505,2,14,Mr Garrison,But I feel like I'm making the wrong decision.
4506,2,14,Mr Twig,"Love isn't a decision, its a feeling. If we could decide who we love, it would be much simpler, but much less magical."
4507,2,14,Mr Garrison,"I'll never forget you, Mr. Twig. Thank you."
4508,2,14,Teen MC,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John! Whoo!"
4509,2,14,Elton John,"Thank you all for coming to help Chef. This is a song written by a very special little boy. I have no idea what his name is, but who the hell cares? Anyway, he wrote it for his girlfriend."
4510,2,14,Elton John,"Wake up, Wendy!"
4511,2,14,Elton John,Smell the coffee...
4512,2,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, that's your song for Wendy!"
4513,2,14,Eric Cartman,"Ha-ha, you're a wuss."
4514,2,14,Mr. Big Record Producer,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I win! You lose! Chef Aid is over, and you didn't raise near enough money to pay Cochran's legal fees. Ha-ha-ha-ha, I win!"
4515,2,14,Narrator,"And what happened then? Well, in South Park they say..."
4516,2,14,Narrator,Johnnie Cochran's heart grew three sizes that day.
4517,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,"Wait! [Walks to Chef.] Mr. Chef, this music has really touched me. I like to take up your case, free of charge!"
4518,2,14,Chef,You will?
4519,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,I will.
4520,2,14,Mr. Big Record Producer,No!
4521,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,"We'll see you in court, Mr. Record Producer."
4522,2,14,Mr. Big Record Producer,[Dropping to his knees.] Noooooooo!
4523,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,"Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client, Chef. I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this..."
4524,2,14,Johnnic Cochran,"...is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talkin' about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line? Why? I tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!"
4525,2,14,Johnnie Cochran,"Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey."
4526,2,14,Reporter,"Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, ""Stinky Britches""?"
4527,2,14,Chef,"It feels great! I just can't find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children."
4528,2,14,Reporter,"So, what are you gonna do now?"
4529,2,14,Chef,Get back to what's important. It's Tuesday. And means tomorrow is tuna casserole day.
4530,2,14,Stan Kyle and Cartman,Hooray!
4531,2,15,Announcer,The following program is brought to you in spooky vision. Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.
4532,2,15,Stan Marsh,I wonder why Cartman wasn't in school today.
4533,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.
4534,2,15,Eric Cartman,Hey guys. How's it going?
4535,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, nice costume, dude. Who are you supposed to be? Luke Perry?"
4536,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, how come you weren't in school today?"
4537,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Did you eat too many pork rinds last night?
4538,2,15,Eric Cartman,"You guys, you're so funny. No matter how I'm feeling, I can always count on you guys to lighten me up."
4539,2,15,Stan Marsh,What?
4540,2,15,Eric Cartman,"I had to stay home because my mother wasn't feeling well. She has the flu, and I wanted to take care of the house so she could stay in bed"
4541,2,15,Eric Cartman,I just wanted to catch you guys to see if we were assigned any homework tonight.
4542,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell are you talking about, Cartman?!"
4543,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Stop screwing around, dude. We're all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve."
4544,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[Excited.] Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I'll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?"
4545,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is creepy."
4546,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Stanley? Look who's here. Aunt Flo.
4547,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Hello, Stanley. Remember me?"
4548,2,15,Stanley,"[Flatly.] Hi, Aunt Flo."
4549,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Now, Stanley! Aunt Flo only visits once a month. Be nice."
4550,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Hey, Stanley. I brought you and Shelly presents."
4551,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Wow, really?! Hey, I love Aunt Flo!"
4552,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Okay, Shelly. This one's for you."
4553,2,15,Aunt Flo,It's a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.
4554,2,15,Stan Marsh,Wow!
4555,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"What do you say, Shelly?"
4556,2,15,Shelly,"Thank you, Aunt Flo."
4557,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, Stanley. Your turn."
4558,2,15,Aunt Flo,Your very own fish.
4559,2,15,Shelly,"What do you say, Stanley?"
4560,2,15,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
4561,2,15,Aunt Flo,[Softly.] I think he likes you. [Normal.] Come on Shelly. Let's hook up your home theater.
4562,2,15,Shelly,Okay.
4563,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"How do you like your fish, Stanley?"
4564,2,15,Stan Marsh,I don't like it. It's spooky.
4565,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, now, what's spooky about a cute, little goldfish? Go put him in your room."
4566,2,15,Stan Marsh,Do I have to?
4567,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, you do!"
4568,2,15,Stan Marsh,Damn it!
4569,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Language!
4570,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Where have you been, dude?"
4571,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Dude, my mom's having her monthly visitor."
4572,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Aunt Flo?
4573,2,15,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Every time she shows up my mom turns into a total bitch.
4574,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Where is Cartman? He said he was gonna bring money for us to buy a pumpkin.
4575,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wonder why he's being so nice."
4576,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Here he comes.
4577,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Cartman! Did you bring us money from your mom?"
4578,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[clean-shaven] Heh! Yeah, right! You guys could kiss my black ass!"
4579,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You said you could get us money, Cartman!"
4580,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Man, you guys are hella stupid! If I had money, I wouldn't give it to you assholes!"
4581,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, at least he's back to normal."
4582,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but we can't get a pumpkin, so we can't enter the carving contest!"
4583,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,It's okay. Kenny said he'd get one.
4584,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh, how's Kenny gonna get one?! He's hella poor!"
4585,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Why do you keep saying ""hella"", fatass?!"
4586,2,15,Eric Cartman,"'Cause I'm hella cool, that's why."
4587,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,That's not cool!
4588,2,15,Eric Cartman,You guys are just hella jealous.
4589,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Good night, Stanley. We'll uh see you in the morning."
4590,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Can you leave the light on, Dad?"
4591,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity."
4592,2,15,Stan Marsh,I wish Aunt Flo didn't have to visit now.
4593,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I'll be out sleeping on the couch. [turns the light off and closes the door]."
4594,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Where did it go? [he lifts the covers and looks under the bed, then sits back. The fish swims back into view.] Huhhh. [he gets out, picks up his shirt, and throws it over the tank. He goes back to bed and looks at the tank again.]"
4595,2,15,Kenny McCormick,(Give me that-!) [pulls the blanket off Kevin]
4596,2,15,Mrs McCormick,Kenny [paf]
4597,2,15,Kenny McCormick,"(Ow, mom!)"
4598,2,15,Mrs McCormick,You share that blanket with your brother! [knock knock knock]
4599,2,15,Stuart McCormick,Who the hell could that be? [the front door opens and the family looks to see who it is].
4600,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[with mustache and beard, and dressed in raingear] Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. [a box of SUPPLIES is next to him. The parents look at each other] There's some candles and food in there. It ain't much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I've got other houses to get to. [walks off]."
4601,2,15,Stuart McCormick,"[suspicious] Kenny, wasn't that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?"
4602,2,15,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh.)
4603,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Hey. Where did the shirt go? [hops off and approaches the fish] I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! [the fish blinks, then looks down and to the right. Stan's eyes follow, and he sees the shirt.] AAAaAaAaAa [runs back to his bed and pulls the covers up, then drops them a bit. He looks at the fish] I'm not gonna look. [shuts his eyes, then opens them again. The fish tank, and the dresser it's on, are closer to the bed] It's not closer. I'm just seeing things. [shuts his eyes again, then opens them. The tank and dresser are at the foot of his bed] GAAAH! [shuts his eyes tight, and opens them one more time. The fish tank is now on the bed, between his feet] AAAAAAAH!! [he jumps off, runs to his door, and rushes into the hallway] MOM! Mom! [comes back to the room with her in tow]"
4604,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, settle down!"
4605,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Look. He's gonna kill me, Mom!"
4606,2,15,Aunt Flo,[at the door] Is there a problem? [walks to Sharon]
4607,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo."
4608,2,15,Aunt Flo,Do you not like your goldfish?
4609,2,15,Stan Marsh,No!
4610,2,15,Aunt Flo,I'm sorry. I'm a bad aunt. [buries her face in her hand and begins to sob.]
4611,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley loves his goldfish. [he merely looks up at them]"
4612,2,15,Stan Marsh,AAAAAAAAH! [runs back to bed]
4613,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[enters his room and turns on the lights] Stanley, what are you doing?!"
4614,2,15,Stan Marsh,[pointing] The fish! [nothing is left of the writing on the tank wall] But-
4615,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, I'm in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up. [Shelly stands in front of Sharon, then approaches Stan and slaps him, then leaves the room] Go to sleep, Stanley! [turns off the light and closes the door behind her.]"
4616,2,15,Stan Marsh,[gasps. A man lies dead between the tank and the bed] WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!
4617,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"All right, Stanley. I have had enough o- [freezes when she sees the body, then, quivering] Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? [rushes to comfort him]"
4618,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-"
4619,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[covers his mouth with her arm, then quietly] Sshhh. It's okay, honey. It's okay. I've got such a good boy, Mommy's little angel. [kisses him and gets up] Now, don't worry, Stanley. Mommy's going to hide the body. [starts to drag it away] Nobody's going to take my baby away. I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. [she drags the body out of the room and out into the storm. Stan just looks at her]"
4620,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[turns to the fish] You're not gonna get away with this! [the fish writes again, blows, and the message is: ""Yes I Will.""]"
4621,2,15,Aunt Flo,[her silhouette appears] Sharon!
4622,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"D'uh! Aunt Flo, what are you doing up?!"
4623,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Look at you, with your little shovel. Just like when you were twelve."
4624,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[sees Sharon pass by] Mom, what are you doing?"
4625,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Sshh. It's going to be okay, Stanley."
4626,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Mom, do you think I killed that guy? It was the fish! He says I'm next!"
4627,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[enters the room] Now get some sleep, baby. Mommy's taken care of everything."
4628,2,15,Stan Marsh,But MOM!
4629,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[Cradles Stan] Sshh.

Hush little baby, don't say a word.
Momma's gonna buy you a mockin' bird.
If that mockin' bird don't sing, Momma's gonna bury it in the backyard"
4630,2,15,Stan Marsh,MMOOMM!
4631,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[frantic] What is it, honey? [gasp!] My baby's killed again!"
4632,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[points at the body, then holds up his hands] No, mom!"
4633,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[holds him tight] What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do?? [the fish looks on. Sharon drags the body out] I've got such a handsome boy, such a good boy."
4634,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"It's about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?"
4635,2,15,Kenny McCormick,(Uh huh!)
4636,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Well, where is it? [Kenny brings out a squash and sets it on the table] What the hell is that?!"
4637,2,15,Kenny McCormick,(It's the only thing I could afford.)
4638,2,15,Eric Cartman,"It's all you could afford?! Whoever heard of a squah-o-lantern, Kenny?! That's hella stupid!"
4639,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman! [to Kenny] How are we gonna win the contest with a squash? [as Kyle says this Stan enters the room] Whoa, Stan. You don't look so good."
4640,2,15,Stan Marsh,[squeezes into Kyle's chair so both fit. Cartman walks to Kenny's chair] I haven't been sleeping so well.
4641,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[cuts the top off the squash and taps at the bottom to clear it out. Sigh] God, I hate you, Kenny. [works on the squash some more] I have to get another knife; this one's hella dull! [goes into the kitchen for another one]"
4642,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"God, will you shut up?!"
4643,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?"
4644,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
4645,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Do you think animals can be murderers, too?"
4646,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. [the bearded Cartman comes in with a huge knife] Oh, great. He's got that stupid beard on again."
4647,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[gives Kenny a hand] No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You're gonna hurt yourself. Seriously, dude. Isn't this fun, you guys? Carving pumpkins for Halloween?


You guys are my best friends
Through thick and thin, we've always been together
We're four of a kind, havin' fun all day
Pallin' around and laughin' away
Just best friends, best friends are we.

 I love you guys. [throughout the song, Kyle and Stan look on with awe]"
4648,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You seem tired, Stan."
4649,2,15,Stan Marsh,I haven't been sleeping well.
4650,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
4651,2,15,Stan Marsh,My pet goldfish killed another random person last night.
4652,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Hoh, that sucks, dude."
4653,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Hey, dudes. Man, it's hella cold out here."
4654,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Cartman?
4655,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Who'd you expect? Maury Povich? Golly, you're hella lame!"
4656,2,15,Stan Marsh,What are you doing?!
4657,2,15,Eric Cartman,"What do you mean, what am I doing?! I'm just standing here. Jesus, mellow out, you guys."
4658,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You can't be standing there, Cartman."
4659,2,15,Eric Cartman,Why the hell not?!
4660,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Because you're standing over there!
4661,2,15,Eric Cartman,[seeing his parallel for the first time] Aaah! Son of a bitch!
4662,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"[Cartman walks to him] Wow, you don't see this every day."
4663,2,15,Eric Cartman,I can't believe what I'm seeing.
4664,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,It's like I'm looking in a mirror.
4665,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this is hella weird."
4666,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[answering] Oh. Uh-Officer Barbrady, Woo, wh-what a surprise. What can I do for you?"
4667,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Well, there's been a report of a few missing people."
4668,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Is that so?
4669,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah. No biggie, but I was wondering if you had seen any of them. [show her some pictures of the missing men]"
4670,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"I'd never seen any of those men, Officer Barbrady."
4671,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"No, I didn't think so. Mind if I look around the back yard, though?"
4672,2,15,Sharon Marsh,[somewhat alarmed] Why would you wanna do that?
4673,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Well, I'm checking everyone's back yards. Missing people usually turn up hiding in someone's bushes. May I? [Sharon moves aside and Barbrady enters. They head for the back yard, where five fresh graves await around the clubhouse, and Sparky is pulling a leg out of one of them. Sparky pulls it free and walks away with it] Well, this all looks in- [clunk] oh? Tennis anyone? [falls to the floor unconscious. Sharon had hit him with a pan]"
4674,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Nobody's going to take my baby away from me! Nobody!
4675,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"[missing his pants and shoes, his wrists are tied to posts] Okay, Mrs. Marsh, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you a few questions."
4676,2,15,Chef,"[excited] Hello there, children! [he is dressed as an African chieftain, complete with reebock skull]"
4677,2,15,The Boys,"Hey, Chef."
4678,2,15,Chef,"All ready for our Halloween lunch? Today I've got spooooooky spaghetti, with freeeeeaky French fries."
4679,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Chef?"
4680,2,15,Chef,Or haaauuunted hash browns.
4681,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Chef.
4682,2,15,Chef,"And a creeeeeepy cookie, and moooooonstrous milk!"
4683,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Chef.
4684,2,15,Chef,And a teeeeerrifying napkin!
4685,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Chef!
4686,2,15,Chef,What?!
4687,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,We have problems!
4688,2,15,Chef,"Well, what's the first problem?"
4689,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Chef, I have a goldfish that keeps killing people."
4690,2,15,Chef,"Oh. Well, uh, don't worry, Stan. I'm sure it'll work out. Now, what's the other problem? [Kyle points to Cartman, but now there are two of him. They blink together.] Oh, nohoho. [rubs his eyes] Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!"
4691,2,15,Eric Cartman,"...and them I saw them all at the bus stop, and this son of a bitch is standing there!"
4692,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry I caused so much trouble. This is all very strange to me, too."
4693,2,15,Chef,Exactly what do you remember?
4694,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Well, I was just standing around, and Stan and Kyle were being really mean, as usual, and Kenny had just bought a new car."
4695,2,15,Chef,Of course! That's it!
4696,2,15,Stan Marsh,What?
4697,2,15,Chef,"Don't you see, children? This Cartman is from an evil, parallel universe where everything exists as its opposite!"
4698,2,15,Eric Cartman,He's my evil twin? But he doesn't even look that much like me; he's all fat and stuff. He's hella lying.
4699,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Will you stop saying that word?!
4700,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Of course! My pet goldfish must be from the evil, opposite universe, too!"
4701,2,15,Chef,"Children, somewhere in South Park, something has created a door to the evil, parallel universe!"
4702,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"This is amazing! I can't believe how nice you are, Chef."
4703,2,15,Chef,How do you mean?
4704,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"In my world, you're a skinny, white insurance salesman."
4705,2,15,Aunt Flo,"[shaking] Ooh, hello, boys. I'm Stan's Aunt Flo."
4706,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Whoa! What's wrong with your head?! Why are you shaking like that?
4707,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[taps Kyle, then softly] Dude, that's not cool. She's got Parkinson's disease."
4708,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Ey, sweet! [hops on her lap] Sweeeeeet! Check it out, guys; you don't even have to put a quarter in her."
4709,2,15,Stan Marsh,Cartman!
4710,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Dude, this is hella cool."
4711,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Aunt Flo, where did you get this goldfish?"
4712,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Nn-oh. [Cartman hops off and rejoins the boys] I got it from the pet store, Stanley."
4713,2,15,Stan Marsh,Do you remember what pet store?
4714,2,15,Aunt Flo,"Let's see. I believe it was called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store,"" just outside of town."
4715,2,15,Stan Marsh,Where?
4716,2,15,Aunt Flo,I know I have the address written down somewhere. [Stan turns and takes Kyle aside] Let me look.
4717,2,15,Stan Marsh,"That's it, dude. We've gotta take the spooky fish back to that pet store."
4718,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Who's ""we""? You got a turd in your pocket? I'm goin' home. I'm hella hungry!"
4719,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"I'll help you, Stan."
4720,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Shut your god-damned mouth, fatass!"
4721,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. Are you sure that fish is a murderer? It seemed like a normal fish to me.
4722,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Just help me take it back. Come on! [walks to Aunt Flo, who's now dead on the floor] Did you find the address, Aunt Flo- Aunt Flo!"
4723,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[rushing in] Oh, Stanley, no! Not Aunt Flo! [holds her hands to her face]"
4724,2,15,Stan Marsh,It was the fish! [points to it]
4725,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[dragging Aunt Flo, mutters] Oh, what a good baby. What a good son I have. [the fish swims around]"
4726,2,15,Stan Marsh,Now we'll never know where that pet store is!
4727,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"There can't be that many pet stores in South Park, dude. [the fish jumps out and somehow pulls Kenny into the tank head first.]"
4728,2,15,Stan Marsh,Aunt Flo isn't from South Park. The pet store could be anywhere between here and Denver. [Kenny starts to gargle as the fish gives him the blender treatment. The water turns blood red as Kenny spins in the tank]
4729,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we'd better get working. Cartman, you go home and call all the pet stores in the phone book."
4730,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,Can do!
4731,2,15,Eric Cartman,Screw you! [the fish spits Kenny's corpse out of the tank and jumps back in. Kenny's left eye is gone and the water is clear]
4732,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[returning] It's all taken care of, Stanley- G'oh! [sees Kenny's corpse and reacts frantically. Rats rush in to munch on it] I've got such a good boy, such a handsome boy! [drags Kenny away. The fish looks on]"
4733,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Come on, we're running out of time. [both walk by Randy trying to open a door]"
4734,2,15,Randy Marsh,"[turns around] Hey, why is the basement door locked? [turns back and keeps trying]"
4735,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"-crack corn and I don't care
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care
My master's gone away
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care"
4736,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"I don't see any pet stores called ""Indian Burial Ground."""
4737,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, dude! I'm trying to watch TV!"
4738,2,15,Announcer,"And now, back to the Terrance and Phillip Halloween Special."
4739,2,15,Terrance,[both are dressed as ghosts] (Fart)
4740,2,15,Phillip,"[long pause] That fart was absolutely ghoulish, Terrance. [both pull out little daggers and stab each other as they laugh. Small spurts of blood ensue.]"
4741,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Uh-ho-ho, man, that's hella funny! [slaps his thigh]"
4742,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,[looks up] What's so funny about that?
4743,2,15,Mr. Kitty,Meow.
4744,2,15,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie!"
4745,2,15,Mr Kitty,Meow.
4746,2,15,Eric Cartman,"No, Kitty, this is my pot pie, Kitty!"
4747,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"[picks up Kitty] Who's my kitty? Who's my little kitty? My fluffy little cat. Yeah, that's good, yeah, that's my nice little kitty, yeah. [Kitty is purring loudly, happily now. Cartman is not amused.]"
4748,2,15,Eric Cartman,"NO KITTY, BAD KITTY!!! [Evil Cartman is startled as Kitty jumps away.] Hahaha, you-hoo suck, dude."
4749,2,15,Sharon Marsh,Stanley. Kenny's mother is here. She's wondering if you've seen Kenny.
4750,2,15,Mrs McCormick,"[approaches him] You saw him, didn't you? [Sharon mouths and waves ""no"" to Stan] You saw my boy. [sits down on the sofa between the boys]"
4751,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, my goldfish-."
4752,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Yeah. Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over."
4753,2,15,Mrs McCormick,"[cradling Stan, distraught] My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was."
4754,2,15,Stan Marsh,I know.
4755,2,15,Mrs McCormick,You've gotta tell me what happened to him! [holds Stan up and throttles him] You have to know something!
4756,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[intervening] Mrs. McCormick, I'm going to have to ask you to leave! You've been drinking!"
4757,2,15,Mrs McCormick,"That's right, I'm a little drunk. [Sharon escorts her to the door] You'd be drunk, too, if you'd lost your boy. [Evil Cartman enters as the women reach the door] My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh."
4758,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"[at the sofa] You guys, I found the pet store!"
4759,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go! [takes the fish with him and stops before Sharon] Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I'm gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!"
4760,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"I believe you, sweetheart. [Stan goes outside, and she addresses Kyle and Evil Cartman] Run from him, boys. Run and don't stop!"
4761,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,Can I help you boys?
4762,2,15,Stan Marsh,I wanna return a fish.
4763,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,[pounds the counter with both fists] Damn it!
4764,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,What?
4765,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"That's the ninth return I've had this week! What's wrong with it? [holds his palms out] Ap! Let me guess. It killed a bunch of people, right?"
4766,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude."
4767,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Damn it! [pounds with the right fist] Just like all the other returns! [the camera pulls back to show them. They all groan and have red, evil eyes. One bird blinks, and its eyes glow]"
4768,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, why is your store called ""The Indian Burial Ground Pet Store?"""
4769,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Well, there was an Indian burial ground here before I bought it."
4770,2,15,Stan Marsh,So you just- built your store on top of an Indian burial ground?
4771,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Oh, hell no! First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on 'em, then buried them again upside down."
4772,2,15,Stan Marsh,Why?
4773,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,Why? I don't know. I was drunk.
4774,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe."
4775,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Well, that certainly would explain a lot."
4776,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Like what?
4777,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"Well, like this. [opens a door marked, ""Employees Only."" A bright, flashing portal appears] I've been wondering what the hell this was."
4778,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Hello, Mr. Marsh. Top of the evening to you. [Randy turns to see Officer Barbrady, then rushes up the stairs] Okay, bye, then."
4779,2,15,Randy Marsh,Sharon?
4780,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, hon?"
4781,2,15,Randy Marsh,There's a policeman being held captive in our basement.
4782,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[rolling the dough] Yes, hon. I had to restrain him so he wouldn't find the bodies in the back yard and take our baby away. [begins cutting out cookies in star shapes.]"
4783,2,15,Randy Marsh,"[ponders] Why'd you take his pants off? [long pause. Sharon makes more cookies] Sh-sharon, why'd you take his- pants off?"
4784,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[sobs. Randy comes over] Oh, Randy, I just don't know what to do anymore."
4785,2,15,Randy Marsh,What is it?
4786,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"I just ughhhh, I can't believe that Aunt Flo is gone, that she won't be visiting me ever again."
4787,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Oh. Uh, well, don't- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?"
4788,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish."
4789,2,15,Cler,I can't give you your money back.
4790,2,15,Stan Marsh,"I don't care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!"
4791,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,No! I won't take it back!
4792,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Listen, friend. You can't sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, ""Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe."" Now, it's not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land's native people, but by golly [pounds his right hand with his left fist], you're gonna take this fish back."
4793,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,"All right, you win."
4794,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Wow! Thanks, evil Cartman! [the clerk takes the fish from Stan]"
4795,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"[turns to face the clerk again] And sir, can I make a suggestion? [the clerk looks at him] Move your store, and let these great people of the Wampanoag rest in peace."
4796,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You kick ass, evil Cartman!"
4797,2,15,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
4798,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"You know what I like best about you? You don't say, ""hella,"" like our Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I'm gonna kill him! [the boys exit the store, and the skies are clear]"
4799,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer. [the clerk puts the fish up on a shelf and the employee door opens, the doorway glowing brightly]"
4800,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,[recoils] What the-? [two figures appear: Evil Stan and Evil Kyle]
4801,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,He was here! Cartman was just here!
4802,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,Who are you?
4803,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,We're looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?
4804,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,I don't know who you mean?
4805,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,[pulls out a big bat] Maybe this will jog your memory! [starts releasing the evil returns by bashing in the cages]
4806,2,15,Indian Burial Ground Pet Store Clerk,No! Stop! You don't know what you're doing! Those pets are evil!
4807,2,15,Stan Marsh,I'm sure glad that's over with. Now I can sleep at night.
4808,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Hey, you guys. We still have time to enter the pumpkin-carving contest."
4809,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, yeah! I almost forgot."
4810,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,Come on! I bet that together we can make the best pumpkin ever!
4811,2,15,Stan Marsh,"You know, evil Cartman? I like you a lot better than our Cartman."
4812,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, you're cool. And you don't say ""hella."""
4813,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Yuh, thanks, you guys. I certainly like you a lot more than in my evil, parallel universe. [the boys turn to see a man attacked by two dogs, a cat, two ducks, and a vulture]"
4814,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, where are we going to find a pumpkin to carve?"
4815,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,Let's use Kenny's squash.
4816,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You know, I never thought it was such a bad, little squash. It just needs some tender, loving care."
4817,2,15,Terrance,"[as a ghost, walks up to Phillip] Boo!"
4818,2,15,Phillip,[jumps up] Aaaaagh!
4819,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Aw, man, this movie is hella scary. [click. The front door flies open and Evil Stan and Evil Kyle burst in]"
4820,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"Aha! There you are, Cartman!"
4821,2,15,Eric Cartman,"P'h. Nice costume, you guys. You spent about a buck fifty on those?"
4822,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"We're here to take you back, Goody Two-Shoes!"
4823,2,15,Eric Cartman,Oh? I've got a better idea. Why don't you two go fuck yourselves?
4824,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"[he and Evil Kyle look at each other, then] Hey! What's wrong with you, Cartman?"
4825,2,15,Eric Cartman,What's wrong with me? Let's see. Uum. [checks them off] I hate you guys. You're hella stupid.
4826,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"[he and Evil Stan go over to grab him] Come on, Mr. Wholesome! We're taking you back to our universe!"
4827,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Don't touch me! [punches Evil Stan, who releases him]"
4828,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,What the hell's goin' on?! Cartman never hits us!
4829,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"Hall right! Just stand there, Cartman! This gingerification gun will send you back to our universe!"
4830,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh, right! You guys are from the evil, parallel universe?!"
4831,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,Yes!
4832,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Oh, it's about freakin' time you showed up! You don't want me, you want that impostor Cartman! Come on, I'll show you. [leads them out the door]"
4833,2,15,Mayor McDaniels,"And the winner is: Squash-O-Lantern, by Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and the evil Eric Cartman from the parallel universe! ""The Winning Entry! Squash in cobweb, amid a tiny graveyard and flanked by four tiny bats"""
4834,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[the crowd cheers] We won, dude!"
4835,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,Hooray!
4836,2,15,Mayor McDaniels,You boys win the Halloween Chocolate Ball!
4837,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Oh, no! [spots Cartman, Evil Stan and Evil Kyle] Stan and Kyle have come to take my back to my world, and I don't wanna go back!"
4838,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry, Evil Cartman. You're staying with us! [the two groups face each other]"
4839,2,15,Eric Cartman,"[to Evil Kyle] Now, zap his hella ass back to your- hella universe!"
4840,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Stop saying ""hella,"" Cartman!"
4841,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"[to Evil Cartman] Thought you could get away from us, huh, Cartman?!"
4842,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,[pleading] Please!
4843,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Leave him alone, butthole!"
4844,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"Shut your trap, kid!"
4845,2,15,Stan Marsh,Why don't you guys take our Cartman back? He's more like you anyway.
4846,2,15,Eric Cartman,"Ey, you backstabbin' sellout!"
4847,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"It's time, Cartman! Prepare for gingerification! [sets the gun]"
4848,2,15,Evil Eric Cartman,"Well, good-bye, you guys. It's been fun. [Stan and Kyle look down. The evil pets return to South Park and start attacking the townsfolk. They scream as they are being attacked.]"
4849,2,15,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, what now?!"
4850,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"It's the evil pets [the attack continues, and a vulture knocks the gingerification gun out of Evil Stan's hands.]"
4851,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,The gingerification gun!
4852,2,15,Stan Marsh,"[picks it up] Get to the stage! [Stan, Kyle, and Evil Cartman rush up. Stan's spooky fish attacks a man and kills him]"
4853,2,15,Sharon Marsh,"[seeing what just happened] Oh, dear. It really was Stan's fish that killed those people!"
4854,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,"[all six boys are on stage] Give me that gun, kid!"
4855,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Up yours, evil twin! [zaps him back to the evil, parallel universe.]"
4856,2,15,Evil Stan Marsh,[shrinks as Evil Kyle watches] Noooooo! [vanishes]
4857,2,15,Evil Kyle Broflovski,"[zapped, he shrinks too] Noooooo! [vanishes]"
4858,2,15,Eric Cartman,"All right, now you can try to send this Bozo through and the whole mess'll be over with!"
4859,2,15,Stan Marsh,Sorry Cartman. We like Evil Cartman better. See ya. [takes aim]
4860,2,15,Eric Cartman,What?!
4861,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"We can't deal with you saying ""hella"" anymore, Cartman! You're going to the other universe! [Cartman takes on Evil Cartman, and both wrestle. Cartman rips off Evil Cartman's mustache and beard, and kicks him. Both of them then stand up, indistinguishable. Stan pulls the gingerification gun back]"
4862,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Which one is the good Cartman?
4863,2,15,Both Cartmans,I am!
4864,2,15,Stan Marsh,"Stop wasting time, Cartman! We have to send one of you back to the evil universe!"
4865,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah! Now, which one of you is the Cartman we can't stand?!"
4866,2,15,Both Cartmans,[pointing to the other one] He is!
4867,2,15,Cartman on Left,Time is running out. You'll have to destroy us both.
4868,2,15,Cartman on Right,What?!
4869,2,15,Cartman on Left,"It's the only way you can be sure. We have to both go, for the good of the world."
4870,2,15,Cartman on Right,[Stan zaps him] Noooo! Screw you guys! [disappears]
4871,2,15,Cartman on Left,How did you guys know?
4872,2,15,Stan Marsh,Our Cartman would never say anything like that.
4873,2,15,Eric Cartman,Haaa hahaha! You guys are hella stupid! I knew you would fall for that!
4874,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh no, dude!"
4875,2,15,Stan Marsh,"You tricked us, Cartman!"
4876,2,15,Eric Cartman,"That's right, I did!

You guys are hella stupid
You guys are hella lame
You guys are hella dumb
Hella hella hella!"
4877,2,15,Kyle Broflovski,Damn it!
4878,2,15,Randy Marsh,"I'm sorry my wife held you captive, officer. She's been upset 'cause her Aunt Flo isn't gonna visit her anymore."
4879,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, I understand. I remember when my wife stopped getting her monthly visitor."
4880,2,15,Randy Marsh,"Uuuh, do you want your pants back?"
4881,2,15,Officer Barbrady,"No. Just leave me with my dignity. [turns around and walks into the crowd] Okay, people, move along. Nothing to see here."
4882,2,16,Sharon Marsh,"The answer is ""no"", Stanley!"
4883,2,16,Stan Marsh,"But Mom, all the guys are going to Cartman's Grandma's for the weekend!"
4884,2,16,Sharon Marsh,"I'm sorry, Stanley, I can't let you go all the way to Nebraska by yourself. It's the holidays."
4885,2,16,Stan Marsh,But all the other guys get to go to Cartman's Grandma's; why can't I?
4886,2,16,Sharon Marsh,I'll leave it up to your father.
4887,2,16,Randy Marsh,"[shrugs] Eh, it's fine with me."
4888,2,16,Sharon Marsh,"[ignoring him] The answer is no, Stanley! Now go wash up for supper!"
4889,2,16,Stan Marsh,I don't want your lame-ass supper!
4890,2,16,Shelly Marsh,Ew! You're gonna get it now.
4891,2,16,Sharon Marsh,"[pointing to her right] Go to your room, Stanley! Right now! [Randy's angry now. Stan walks to his room and shuts the door]"
4892,2,16,Stan Marsh,"[retrieving a backpack from his closet] Can't tell me what to do! I'm eight years old! [goes to his window, opens it, and stands on the sill] I don't need this stupid family anyway! [drops to the ground outside and leaves]"
4893,2,16,Sheila Broflovski,It's so nice of you to take all the boys with you.
4894,2,16,Liane Cartman,"Oh, it's my pleasure. Eric loves his little friends."
4895,2,16,Eric Cartman,"[to Kyle] Every time I go to my Grandma's house, she gives me a present. You watch: as soon as I walk in the door she'll hand me a big present, for no reason, except that I'm cool."
4896,2,16,Kyle Broflovski,"That's nice, Cartman."
4897,2,16,Stuart McCormick,"[on bended knee, to Kenny] Now, remember, if they have left-over turkey, put some in a bag and bring it home, okay?"
4898,2,16,Kenny McCormick,(Okay)
4899,2,16,Stan Marsh,"[walking up] Okay, let's go!"
4900,2,16,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I didn't think you were coming, Stan."
4901,2,16,Stan Marsh,"'Course I'm coming! Come on, let's hurry!"
4902,2,16,Sheila Broflovski,"[Kyle walks away] Goodbye, bubbe! Be careful!"
4903,2,16,Stuart McCormick,"[waving to Kenny] See you in a couple of days, son."
4904,2,16,Eric Cartman,"[rushing past Kyle, who joins Stan on the back seat] Shotgun! It's my car, I call it first: shotgun! [opens the door, only to find Kenny already there. They look at each other] Kenny, I called it shotgun! [Kenny stares back] Dammit, Kenny, get in the back! [Kenny moves not. Cartman points to the right] Hey, Kenny, there's a sale on orange jackets over there. [no movement. Cartman points to the road] Look, Kenny, there's an elephant parade! [Kenny is not moved. Cartman reaches into his pocket and pulls out a dollar] Ken-ny. Kenny, look. Look! Go get it! [throws the bill away], Go get it! [Kenny hops out and Cartman jumps in] ha ha ha, you poor piece of crap. [Kenny gets the bill and hops into the back seat. Lo and behold, there is an elephant parade, with clowns and jugglers and... Liane drives off]"
4905,2,16,Stan Marsh,"So, how far is it to Nebraska?"
4906,2,16,Liane Cartman,Around six hours.
4907,2,16,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God! What the hell are we gonna do for six hours?
4908,2,16,Liane Cartman,"Well, I've got an idea. We could sing."
4909,2,16,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Or, we could not."
4910,2,16,Eric Cartman,"Let's sing that one Grandma song, Ma. How does it go?"
4911,2,16,Liane Cartman,Over the meadow and through the woods
4912,2,16,Liane and Cartman,"To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh
Through white and drifted snow..."
4913,2,16,Liane and Cartman,"Over the meadow and through the woods
To Grandmother's house we go
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh"
4914,2,16,Kyle Broflovski,Please stop.
4915,2,16,Liane and Cartman,Through white and drifted snow
4916,2,16,Kyle Broflovski,[insistent] Please stop!
4917,2,17,Mr Garrison,"[entering] Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad. [the class is now seated] The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There's a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again. [Stan raises his hand] Yes, Stanley?"
4918,2,17,Stan Marsh,That's okay with us.
4919,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
4920,2,17,Clyde,"Yeah, we don't care."
4921,2,17,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, that's fine."
4922,2,17,Mr Garrison,"No it isn't, it makes you very sad! Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don't teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they're going to have you do presentations for the whole board."
4923,2,17,Class,Aawwww! [heads drop]
4924,2,17,Mr Garrison,"[writes on the board] ""Current Events in South Park"". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on."
4925,2,17,Class,Aawwww! [heads drop. Cartman is certainly vocal about it.]
4926,2,17,Mr Garrison,"Now, this'll be a group project, so I'm going to place you all into groups of five. Let's see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Token, you'll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek."
4927,2,17,Tweek Tweak,[disheveled and really tweaked] AAAghah heheh.
4928,2,17,Stan Marsh,"[laments] Oh, not Tweek."
4929,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,We don't wanna be in a group with Tweek.
4930,2,17,Mr Garrison,There's nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he'll do a great job in your group.
4931,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"I can't take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!"
4932,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we can't work with this kid."
4933,2,17,Tweek Tweak,Yuh-ugh!
4934,2,17,Mr Garrison,"That's what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of Medical Center. He thought, ""Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?"" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett's brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? [silence]"
4935,2,17,Stan Marsh,No.
4936,2,17,Mr Garrison,"Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn't kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!"
4937,2,17,Tweek Tweak,Wagh!
4938,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Hello there, customer."
4939,2,17,Customer,Hello. How are you today?
4940,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee? [motions to the menu]"
4941,2,17,Customer,I'm actually interested in something else. I'm John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...
4942,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, you're that corporate guy who's been calling."
4943,2,17,John Postum,That's right. How come you don't call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.
4944,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale."
4945,2,17,John Postum,"My company's prepared to make you a veerry generous offer. [lifts the briefcase and opens it. It's empty, but he elaborates] This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?"
4946,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Uh, I don't think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me."
4947,2,17,John Postum,"Well, all right. [closes the briefcase and lifts up two money bag] How about $500,000?"
4948,2,17,Richard Tweak,"The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. [moves to his left, towards a backdrop containing lovely rolling hills and a rainbow. A soothing acoustic tune comes up] Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more. [a cart of beans rolls up to him] And that's why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America."
4949,2,17,John Postum,"Well, that's too bad. We're just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you."
4950,2,17,Richard Tweak,[protesting] But that could put me out of business.
4951,2,17,John Postum,"Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!"
4952,2,17,Officer Barbrady,"[sees Postum leaving] Hello, Mr. Tweek."
4953,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Hi, Officer Barbrady."
4954,2,17,Officer Barbrady,Who was that?
4955,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you."
4956,2,17,Officer Barbrady,The usual.
4957,2,17,Richard Tweak,Bye-bye.
4958,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--"
4959,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"[twitching and closing his right eye] AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn."
4960,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Sooo, let's figure out what to do it about."
4961,2,17,Eric Cartman,"How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, Everybody Loves Raymond."
4962,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[angry] No, Cartman, we can't do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?"
4963,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!"
4964,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Great. A lot of help you are, kid."
4965,2,17,Tweek Tweak,The gnomes!
4966,2,17,Stan Marsh,What?
4967,2,17,Tweek Tweak,[gritting his teeth] We can do our report on the gnomes.
4968,2,17,Stan Marsh,What gnomes?
4969,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants."
4970,2,17,Eric Cartman,"Oh, so that's where all my underpants go."
4971,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
4972,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I've never seen any underpants gnomes."
4973,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren't up then, but I am. I can't sleep. Ever."
4974,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we can't do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you're making it up."
4975,2,17,Tweek Tweak,No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I'll prove it to you.
4976,2,17,Richard Tweak,"They want me to sell the store, and it's so much money."
4977,2,17,Mrs Tweak,Some things are more important than money. [turns around] The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.
4978,2,17,Richard Tweak,"I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip."
4979,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Oh, hello, son. How was your day?"
4980,2,17,Tweek Tweak,UUuuUunh!
4981,2,17,Mrs Tweek,That's good. Who are your little friends?
4982,2,17,Tweek Tweak,What do you mean?!
4983,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,We're his oral report buddies.
4984,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it."
4985,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Well, have some coffee boys. I'll brew up another pot for later."
4986,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,Coffee? I don't think I like coffee.
4987,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Hoh, you'll like this coffee. It's fresh."
4988,2,17,Richard Tweak,"[waxing prosaic] Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm."
4989,2,17,Stan Marsh,'Kay. Maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.
4990,2,17,Richard Tweak,Oh. I've got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses?
4991,2,17,Mrs Tweak,Richard!
4992,2,17,Richard Tweak,"No, I'm- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery."
4993,2,17,Tweek Tweak,Mwaaah! Slavery?
4994,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Yes, slavery."
4995,2,17,Stan Marsh,"[to Tweek] Wow, that sucks, dude."
4996,2,17,Richard Tweak,They really have my balls in a salad shooter.
4997,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,We're already doing a paper on Tweek's underpants gnomes.
4998,2,17,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
4999,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you lose them, not because of underpants gnomes."
5000,2,17,Tweek Tweak,Uunnnnhh!
5001,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, you guys! We better get to work!"
5002,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject."
5003,2,17,Mrs Tweak,"Honestly, Richard. I don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds."
5004,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I've got an idea."
5005,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Man, this stuff is strong."
5006,2,17,Stan Marsh,Kind of bitter.
5007,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"[in a corner of the room, scared] What if my parents go out of business? Uh what'll I do?"
5008,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,[going to him] Don't worry about it.
5009,2,17,Tweek Tweak,But we'll starve and die like dogs.
5010,2,17,Eric Cartman,"Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny's family: they're perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?"
5011,2,17,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck you!)
5012,2,17,Eric Cartman,"Heheh, you suck, Kenny."
5013,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, let's just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up."
5014,2,17,Stan Marsh,Aooooo!
5015,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,Woohoo!
5016,2,17,Kenny McCormick,(Let me try! Let me try!)
5017,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeess, this stuff rocks!"
5018,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!"
5019,2,17,Stan Marsh,[running] Whoopee!
5020,2,17,Eric Cartman,"[running around the rim of a throw rug like an Olympian] You guys! You guys! Seriously! I'm a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that."
5021,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?"
5022,2,17,Tweek Tweak,I just have grounds.
5023,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,Killer!! [goes for it and eats it raw]
5024,2,17,Eric Cartman,"[rushing up] Ey, let me have some grounds. [take some, swallows, and throws up]"
5025,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!"
5026,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Hogh, my stomach hurts."
5027,2,17,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, mine too. I wonder why."
5028,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"[peeved] Well, it's 3:30; I don't see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek."
5029,2,17,Tweek Tweak,"Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I'm going insane! Oh no I'm going insane!"
5030,2,17,Stan Marsh,"[cross] Well, this is just great! We haven't gotten anything done, and we're totally screwed!"
5031,2,17,Richard Tweak,"[checking] How's the report going, boys?"
5032,2,17,Stan Marsh,Bad!
5033,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Oh, do you need some more coffee?"
5034,2,17,Boys,Eugh.
5035,2,17,Eric Cartman,No...more...coffee. Blech. [the vomit falls back on him and on the ground]
5036,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Well, boys, uh. I don't mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you."
5037,2,17,All,[suddenly bright] You did?!
5038,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Yes, it's all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don't have to use it."
5039,2,17,Stan Marsh,"[goes with Kyle to get it] No, we'll use it."
5040,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Alright. [Kyle takes it] And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?"
5041,2,17,Kyle Broflovski,"Sure. [""work all night""]"
5042,2,17,Richard Tweak,"Now, when you give the report, [Tweek gasps and points] just make sure that you read this part first, okay? [the gnomes open the door and enter:""Search for underpants, heyWe won't stop until we have underpantsYum tum yummy tum day""]"
5043,2,17,Tweek Tweak,There they are!
5044,2,18,Aussie,"As we steer our boat down [the boys are on the sofa looking at TV], looking for these dangerous predators... Boy, there's a king croc right here. [it slips into the water] He must be four meters; 12, 13 feet long at least. [it looks up at him] This croc has enough power in its jaws to rip my head right off."
5045,2,18,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh, no!) [tightens his hood up]"
5046,2,18,Aussie,"I've got to be careful. So, what I'm gonna do is sneak up on it and jam my thumb in its butthole."
5047,2,18,Stan Marsh,Holy crap. dude!
5048,2,18,Aussie,"If I get bit out here, I'm 200 kilometers from the nearest hospital: I'd better be real careful jamming my thumb in its butthole. [jumps in and grabs the crocodile] Oh, boy, it's pissed off now."
5049,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Go, dude, go! [excited, the boys jump on the sofa]"
5050,2,18,Aussie,"I'm gonna jam my thumb it its butthole now! This should really piss it off! [reaches down with his left thumb to do it. The croc jumps up in pain and drops] Oh, yeah, that pissed it off, all right! [the boys cheer] I've gotta be careful!"
5051,2,18,Stan Marsh,This guy rules!
5052,2,18,Kenny McCormick,(He actually killed it!)
5053,2,18,Eric Cartman,I told you guys.
5054,2,18,Aussie,"[with left arm now bandaged and in a sling] Well! That was quite an angry croc! But I managed to escape with only a few bruises and a shattered left testicle. Next week we'll look for more of these beautiful creatures, so we can learn more about them by pissing them off immensely. Thanks for watching."
5055,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,[to Stan] Dude! Let's go look for crocodiles!
5056,2,18,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
5057,2,18,Eric Cartman,"[with Aussie accent] There's bound to be some crocs up here. I'll use my croc call and try to bring 'em out. Brigeghus, brigeghus! Brig-!"
5058,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"That's not how a croc sounds, you fatass penis!"
5059,2,18,Eric Cartman,"[advancing towards Kyle] Ogh! Now I'm gonna kick my friend Kyle in the beanbag and see what happens, by crikey!"
5060,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Get away from me, Cartman! [backs away]"
5061,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Come 'ere, crocky."
5062,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,[trips over a rock and tumbles down the slope] AAAAAAAAAA!
5063,2,18,Stan Marsh,Dude!
5064,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,[from the bottom of a dark shaft. His figure disappears] HELP! [thud]
5065,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Good job, Cartman! You killed Kyle!"
5066,2,18,Kenny McCormick,(You bastard!)
5067,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Well, he shouldn't have called me fat. [backs up]"
5068,2,18,Stan Marsh,Why the hell not?! That's like calling the sky blue!
5069,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Well, screw him, he's dead! Let's go look for crocodiles! [turns around and walks off]"
5070,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,You guuuys!
5071,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[to Cartman] Hey, he's still alive. [looks down and calls] Kyle, you okay? [Cartman returns and looks down]"
5072,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,I think so. Is Cartman up there?
5073,2,18,Eric Cartman,"I'm right here, Kyle."
5074,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you fucking hunk of fat, rat-fucking hunk of pig-fucking ass fat."
5075,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Oh yeah?! Say that to my face, pussy!"
5076,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Can you climb back up, dude?"
5077,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,I don't think so.
5078,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Damn it, I guess I'll have to go get him."
5079,2,18,Eric Cartman,"[moves away] Nah. Come on, guys. Let's go look for crocodi-iles."
5080,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, dude. This is making me sick. Blaach! [his vomit goes everywhere] Bluchluchluchluch."
5081,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Sick, dude! [wipes some off his cap]"
5082,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Sorry. [Cartman slips a bit] What the hell are you doing, fat boy?! [drops to the cave ground and stands up]"
5083,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!"
5084,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, dude. I wanna get out of here."
5085,2,18,Stan Marsh,All right. Just grab the rope. Wait a minute. What's this?
5086,2,18,Both,AAAAAAAAAAAAA!
5087,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's a dude!"
5088,2,18,Stan Marsh,"He's like, some frozen guy."
5089,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you guys, it's getting cold up here!"
5090,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman! [to Kyle] Dude, I saw this in a movie once. The old cavemen get frozen, and then people discover them and make them their caveman friends."
5091,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Wow. Cool.
5092,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[to Cartman and Kenny] You guys, there's a frozen ape man from the past down here! Send some more rope!"
5093,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Really? [to Kenny] Hey, there's a frozen guy down there."
5094,2,18,Stan Marsh,[to Kyle] Help me chip some of the ice away.
5095,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys. This is just like that one movie, um, John Travolta and that, French chick were doing it, all summer long and went back to school and sang songs about ""Greased Lightning."" [no response] You know, that movie where Sandra Dee thinks she's all prissy, and then they try and try to get an abortion, but she doesn't have all the-"
5096,2,18,Stan and Kyle,"[frustrated by Cartman's talkativeness] CARTMAN, WILL YOU SHUT THE HELL UP AND GET SOME MORE ROPE?!"
5097,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Aww, screw you guys anyway!"
5098,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Hey, remember when that kid found a wallet and got a reward?"
5099,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, sweet! Maybe we can get a reward for the frozen guy!"
5100,2,18,Both,Hooray!
5101,2,18,Eric Cartman,For what?
5102,2,18,Stan Marsh,Where shall we bring it?
5103,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know. We just have to get it to town and let them figure out what to do with it.
5104,2,18,Stan Marsh,I think I'm going to name it Gorak.
5105,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"No, dude! We have to name it Steve."
5106,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[stops] Steve? What the hell kind of caveman name is Steve? [Cartman pulls, but isn't going anywhere]"
5107,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"It's my name, and I found him."
5108,2,18,Stan Marsh,"You didn't find him, I found him."
5109,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you talking about, dude?! I fell down that abyss and there it was!"
5110,2,18,Stan Marsh,You wouldn't even have noticed it if I hadn't pointed it out.
5111,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Kenny, who found the ice man?"
5112,2,18,Kenny McCormick,"(Well, I think you guys should name it Steve.)"
5113,2,18,Eric Cartman,"I think we're almost there, you guys."
5114,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,"Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter. We need to vote on whether South Park should reinstate the death penalty or not. All those in favor, say ""yippee."""
5115,2,18,Some people,Yippee.
5116,2,18,Tardy Man,"Wait, what was that? I missed the question. Yippee! [raises both hands]"
5117,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,"All those opposed, say ""nay."""
5118,2,18,Other people,Nay.
5119,2,18,Tardy Man,Screw you! [punches the guy to his right]
5120,2,18,"Larry, the Prehistoric Ice Man","Ey! Screw you! [hits the tardy man, and everyone starts fighting. The boys show up with the ice man]"
5121,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Huh, excuse me?"
5122,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,"Not now, kids. The town is having a very important debate on capital punishment. [quite vigorously, too]"
5123,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,But we found a frozen ice man from the past! [all stop]
5124,2,18,Stan Marsh,I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
5125,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,No. I found this frozen guy in the woods today.
5126,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,What the hell is going on here?
5127,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,We came for our reward.
5128,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, like the kid with the wallet."
5129,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,[annoyed] Reward? What reward?
5130,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"[arriving] Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link [close-up] in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature's people and its time."
5131,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,"Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off."
5132,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can't give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you'd like, I'll let you name him."
5133,2,18,Stan Marsh,Really.
5134,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Sweet. How about Steve?
5135,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Steve it is.
5136,2,18,Stan Marsh,Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!
5137,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Come on, Steve. We've got work to do. [pushes ""Steve"" away with Kevin. Stan is not happy at Kyle's sleight of word] Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We'll have to use the most advanced methods available."
5138,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era. [turns off the blow dryer and picks up a flashlight to inspect the man] Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven't seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996! [Kevin expresses shock] This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let's just hope the press doesn't get wind of this right away."
5139,2,18,Officer Barbrady and his officers,"Stand back, people. There's nothing to see here."
5140,2,18,Reporter,What about the prehistoric ice man?
5141,2,18,Officer Barbrady and his officers,"Oh, yeah. There is that. [lowers his arms, and the press rushes in.]"
5142,2,18,Reporter,"Dr. Mephesto, could you please tell us what's going on?"
5143,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do. [the press mills around, taking pictures] But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months! [some reporters gasp] Yes, it's true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes."
5144,2,18,Reporter,"Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:"
5145,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"[Stan and Kenny in the background] Well, I fell down this ice cavern, [Stan interrupts him with ""la""s] and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- [Kenny looks at Stan, and Kyle glances back]"
5146,2,18,Reporter,"The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street."
5147,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"That's it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy."
5148,2,18,Steve,[stirs] Uuuurrr.
5149,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Ugh? What's this?
5150,2,18,Steve,[stirs more] Mmmmm.
5151,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,Holy crap! He's alive??
5152,2,18,Dr Mephesto,That's impossible! [to Kevin] Do an EKG on him!
5153,2,18,Steve,Uugh! [Raises his right arm to his head to soothe the pain]
5154,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"My God, he really is alive. The ice must have preserved him!"
5155,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,"[alarmed] Well, quick, do something!"
5156,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"No no, we've got to think this through. [takes the mayor aside] Mayor, this man has not been conscious for almost three years. He won't understand what he sees! He'll be frightened and confused!"
5157,2,18,Mayor McDaniels,"Well, you just can't let him die."
5158,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.
5159,2,18,Steve,"Uh, ughn."
5160,2,18,Dr Mephesto,[moves towards him] Oh my God. It looks as if he's about to speak!
5161,2,18,Steve,[eyes open] Where... where am I?
5162,2,18,Reporter 1,What?
5163,2,18,Reporter 2,What's he saying?
5164,2,18,Reporter 3,Is that English?
5165,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"What? You're, you're hungry?"
5166,2,18,Steve,Where am I?
5167,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"You're, you're hungry?"
5168,2,18,Steve,What's goin' on?
5169,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Me friend. Friieend. Me friend. Ma-phes-to. Mah-phehs-to.
5170,2,18,Steve,Huh?
5171,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Hawgh! If we could understand what he's saying, then maybe we could get some answers. [Kevin hits ""Steve"" a couple more times, and ""Steve"" soothes his head again] If only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own, a mind like... a child."
5172,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I wanted to call him Gorak."
5173,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Gorak's a gay name.
5174,2,18,Stan Marsh,"No, it isn't!"
5175,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Why are you being such a dick?
5176,2,18,Stan Marsh,"I'm not being a dick, you're being a dick!"
5177,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Nuh-uh!
5178,2,18,Officer Barbrady and his officers,"[rushing up] Hello, children. Dr. Mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man."
5179,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,I'll go.
5180,2,18,Stan Marsh,"No, I'll go! I found him!"
5181,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Damn, I've never seen you guys fight like this!"
5182,2,18,Officer Barbrady and his officers,"All right, there's only one fair way to do this. Everyone stick out their potatoes. [thumbs come out] My mother and your mother were out hanging clothes. My mother punched your mother in the nose. What color blood came out? [Lands on Kenny]"
5183,2,18,Kenny McCormick,(Blue.)
5184,2,18,Officer Barbrady and his officers,"B L O O uh oh-O spells ""blue"" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out Mephesto and then we can all go home and watch Murphy Brown. [The boys look confused]"
5185,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Steve. You-
5186,2,18,Steve,Where am I?
5187,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Steeve. Steeeve. Steeeve. [the door opens, and the boys rush in] Oh good, you're here."
5188,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, they revived Gorak."
5189,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards!
5190,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Yes, and I need you to communicate with him. See if you can understand what he's saying."
5191,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hi."
5192,2,18,Steve,Hi.
5193,2,18,Dr Mephesto,[rushing] What'd he say?
5194,2,18,Stan Marsh,"He said, ""hi."""
5195,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Very interesting.
5196,2,18,Steve,Where am I?
5197,2,18,Dr Mephesto,What??
5198,2,18,Stan Marsh,He wants to know where he is.
5199,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Tell him, tell him he's... home."
5200,2,18,Stan Marsh,You're... home.
5201,2,18,Dr Mephesto,In the year 1999.
5202,2,18,Steve,It's 1999??
5203,2,18,Dr Mephesto,He's been frozen for the last 32 months.
5204,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you've been frozen 32 months."
5205,2,18,Dr Mephesto,And we found you-
5206,2,18,Steve,What? Thirty-two months?!
5207,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"All right, all right, all-"
5208,2,18,Steve,Aaaa! [throws over a tray]
5209,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"All right, all right, calm down."
5210,2,18,Steve,[panics] AAAAAAA!
5211,2,18,Dr Mephesto,I think that's enough for today. [sedates him]
5212,2,18,Steve,"Whoa, oh."
5213,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Good job, dude! You freaked him out!"
5214,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Oh, shut up, assmaster. You're just jealous 'cause they had me talk to him."
5215,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Guess what? You're not my best friend anymore! Cartman's my new best friend!
5216,2,18,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
5217,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Oh yeah? Well You're not my best friend anymore, either! Cartman is now my best friend!"
5218,2,18,Eric Cartman,Killer.
5219,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Fine! [turns and walks away]
5220,2,18,Stan Marsh,Fine! [turns and walks away]
5221,2,18,Eric Cartman,Fine.
5222,2,18,Agent,[one of three] Are you Alphonse Mephesto?
5223,2,18,Dr Mephesto,The same.
5224,2,18,Agent,We understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996.
5225,2,18,Dr Mephesto,That's right.
5226,2,18,Agent,We would like to... [notices Kevin and stares] we would like to offer our services in your experiments.
5227,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Oh? Where are you gents from?
5228,2,18,Agent 2,"We are from the University, of... America."
5229,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Well, there's not a lot to see, but... Come in. [opens the door and makes way for them] He's still not responding much to us; the shock is still settling in, [as he leads them, familiar animals can be seen in display cages: four-assed monkey, four-assed mongoose, four-assed ostrich] but we've made great progress now that he's in the habitat."
5230,2,18,Agent,Habitat?
5231,2,18,Dr Mephesto,[they turn the corner into a darkened area] Yes. Kevin and I designed a habitat for Steve to live in that is completely like his own world. Everything is 1996-oriented.
5232,2,18,Agent,Amazing. He looks so much like us.
5233,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Yes, well, Kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us Steve really is. He came up with this drawing:"
5234,2,18,Agent,"Dr. Mephesto, we realize that scientific study is expensive. We want to help you make this project more... lucrative."
5235,2,18,Dr Mephesto,How would we do that?
5236,2,18,Agent,It's easy.
5237,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"As you can see, the ice man is listening to Ace of Base, which was a very popular group during his era, and primitive drumming soothed his people's tempers."
5238,2,18,Stan Marsh,He doesn't look very happy in there.
5239,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"No, he sure doesn't."
5240,2,18,Stan Marsh,"I wasn't talking to you, buttpipe! I was talking to Cartman!"
5241,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I was talking to Cartman, too!"
5242,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Damn, I'm pretty freakin' cool all of a sudden."
5243,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"Ah! Here we see the ice man trying to gain Internet access on the computer. The Internet was still not very big in his time, so the Web frightens and confuses him. [""Steve"" throws the mouse away, then overturns the computer in a fit of rage. The viewers are alarmed as he moves towards the window] It's okay, he can't hurt you. [they chuckle in relief] It's one-way glass: he can't even see us. [""Steve"" goes to the back wall] And now the ice man watches television."
5244,2,18,Aussie,This grizzly bear has the strength of over ten Morgan Freemans. I'm really pissing him off right now.
5245,2,18,Dr Mephesto,[to the Agents] Wait. This could be dangerous.
5246,2,18,Agent,How so?
5247,2,18,Dr Mepehsto,He's changing the channel. Something on the television could frighten and confuse him.
5248,2,18,Sports Reporter,And they've done it! The Atlanta Falcons are going to the Super Bowl!
5249,2,18,Steve,What?!! Rrrowrrr!
5250,2,18,Stan Marsh,[approaches with Kyle and Cartman] You guys aren't being very nice to my creature.
5251,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,He's my creature!
5252,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"He's fine, boys. And we're learning so much from him."
5253,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Let him out, dude. He's scared."
5254,2,18,Agent,He would be more scared on the outside. Do you think this stuff freaks him out? How do you think he'd react to what's happening in the government right now?
5255,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,But it isn't right!
5256,2,18,Agent 2,"Little boy, sometimes, what's right isn't as important as what's profitable."
5257,2,18,Kenny McCormick,[notices the end of the sidewalk] (Uh oh. Ow!)
5258,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[gasps] Oh my God, they killed Kenny! [looks at Kyle]"
5259,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,What?! I'm not talking to you! [walks away]
5260,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[a voice in the night] Gorak! [he rushes to the habitat, then heads to the access door] Gorak! Gorak! Are you there?"
5261,2,18,Steve,Oh hi. What are you doing here? Viewing hours are 10 to 6.
5262,2,18,Stan Marsh,"I don't think it's fair for them to keep you captive like this, Gorak. I came to bust you out."
5263,2,18,Steve,"Wow. That's really nice of you, kid. Thanks!"
5264,2,18,Stan Marsh,What are you doing here?
5265,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,[reaches the access door] I'm here to bust out Steve.
5266,2,18,Stan Marsh,What?! You can't. I'm here to bust out Gorak.
5267,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,His name is Steve!
5268,2,18,Stan Marsh,His name is Gorak!
5269,2,18,Steve,My name is Larry.
5270,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Steve!
5271,2,18,Stan Marsh,Gorak!
5272,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Steve!
5273,2,18,Stan Marsh,What kind of stupid-ass name is Steve?!
5274,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Because, he kinda like looks like Steve Austin, the $6 million man."
5275,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[looks up at Larry, who looks back] No he doesn't!!"
5276,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Does so!
5277,2,18,Larry,"Uh. Hey, kids, could you just open the door so I can get back to my family?"
5278,2,18,Stan Marsh,"I found him, I'm rescuing him!"
5279,2,18,Larry,[to Kyle] Thanks. [leaves]
5280,2,18,Stan Marsh,You're a dick!
5281,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,You're a dick!
5282,2,18,Stan Marsh,"You're a dick, and I've had it with your dicketry! I choose you!"
5283,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"You want a fight? Well, that's fine with me!"
5284,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Tomorrow at the bus stop, 4 o'clock!"
5285,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, why don't we make 3 o'clock?"
5286,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[hushed] Dude, Terrance and Phillip is on at 3."
5287,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"[hushed] Oh yeah. [loudly] Fine, I'll kick your ass tomorrow, dick! [walks away]"
5288,2,18,Stan Marsh,"I'll kick your ass so bad you'll wish you never had it- to begin with! Your ass, I mean. [turns his head aside] Wait. [walks off in the opposite direction]"
5289,2,18,Marilyn Manson,"I just smelled your britches and they're stinky
Stinky Britches
Stinky Britches"
5290,2,18,Larry,Arrrggh!
5291,2,18,Dr Mephesto,He's gone! The ice man has broken out!
5292,2,18,Agent,"No, that's impossible! How could he have?"
5293,2,18,Dr Mephesto,He must have used this... door.
5294,2,18,Agent,"Damn it, Damn it!"
5295,2,18,Dr Mephesto,We have to find him! He won't survive long out in the world!
5296,2,18,Agent,"Yes, and if he isn't found, we won't be able to use him for our military war-"
5297,2,18,Agent 2,Sshhhh!
5298,2,18,Agent,Right.
5299,2,18,Dr. Mephesto,What?
5300,2,18,Agent 2,What?
5301,2,18,Agent,Nothing.
5302,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"No, what did you say? Uh, use him for what?"
5303,2,18,Agent,[shrilly] Butlutlutlutlup!
5304,2,18,Agent 2,"Dr. Mephesto, where could the creature have gone?"
5305,2,18,Dr Mephesto,I have no idea!
5306,2,18,Agent,We'll never track him down on our own. This calls for some special assistance.
5307,2,18,Woman,Can I help you?
5308,2,18,Larry,"Leslie. It's me, Larry. [she stares back, blankly] Your husband?"
5309,2,18,Leslie,Husband? You're not my husband.
5310,2,18,Larry,"Think hard, Leslie. We used to be together, for over eight years?"
5311,2,18,Woman,"I seem to remember a husband, but I think he was lost and never found on Kenosha Pass."
5312,2,18,Larry,That was me!
5313,2,18,Leslie,[a bit stunned] Oh.
5314,2,18,Big Man,"[appears behind her] Who is it, lover?"
5315,2,18,Leslie,"It's my former husband, who I had forgotten all about."
5316,2,18,Big Man,"Ooooo. [he and Larry check each other out] Well, sir, let me shake your hand. I'm proud to meet the man whose wife I'm currently sticking it to every night. [walks away]"
5317,2,18,Larry,So you... remarried.
5318,2,18,Leslie,"Yes, Lorry."
5319,2,18,Larry,Larry!
5320,2,18,Leslie,"Uh, larry. Larry-y, you disap-peared. I waited for you to come home for over three days! I. I remember how cold and lonely the nights got. By the fourth day I knew: I had to move on."
5321,2,18,Larry,Didn't anybody send out a search party?
5322,2,18,Leslie,"We did, Larry. We looked all afternoon. But we found nothing, no trace."
5323,2,18,Larry,"Please, Leslie, I don't know where else to go. I'm confused."
5324,2,18,Leslie,"Leslie, I'm with Buck now. [must be the big dude shown earlier]"
5325,2,18,Larry,You're Leslie.
5326,2,18,Leslie,"Right. I'm with Buck now. We have children together. [they appear] Calvin is eight, and little Buck is 13. I just can't up and leave them. I'm sorry."
5327,2,18,Larry,"I'm sorry, too. I'll leave you alone. [walks away. She closes the door, and he stops] Eight and thirteen? [wrong family?]"
5328,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Well, I don't see any crocs out here."
5329,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Damnit, Cartman, you're supposed to be helping me to get ready to fight Kyle, not playing Australian outback guy!"
5330,2,18,Eric Cartman,"[walks over to a cat nearby] Or, in other words, I'll let this jagu-ar bop me in the face and see if it hurts. Come on, jagu-ar, let's see what you've got! [the cat leaps up and scratches his face] Aaah! Ow, son of a bitch!"
5331,2,18,Stan Marsh,"You suck as a best friend, Cartman!"
5332,2,18,Eric Cartman,You son of a bitch cat!
5333,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[walks to Larry, bathing in a tub out in the open with the garden hose, and looks at him for a while] What are you doing, Gorak!"
5334,2,18,Larry,[turns to see him] I can't live in your time. I'm freezing myself again.
5335,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Wow, that sucks, dude."
5336,2,18,Larry,"Tell me about it. I've been doing this for over three and a half hours now, and only my toes are starting to ice over."
5337,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"[rushing in with a travel guide] Steve, wait!"
5338,2,18,Stan Marsh,"What are you doing here, dick?! We're not supposed to fight until 4 o'clock!"
5339,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"I've got something to show Steve, dick!"
5340,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Gorak is busy freezing himself again, dick!"
5341,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Steve, you don't have to freeze yourself. Look!"
5342,2,18,Larry,What is that? [drops the hose]
5343,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"It's this place called Des Moines. It's like, lost in time, see? [opens the guide to show Des Moines's assets] Everybody looks like you do. [flips the page] Fashion is two years behind, Technology is two years behind, fads, are two years behind, just like you."
5344,2,18,Sorry,[closes it with affection] Home.
5345,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Steve, you're going to Des Moines!"
5346,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Oh, no you don't, glory-monger! Gorak is my responsibility. I'll take him to Des Moines!"
5347,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"No you don't, butthole!"
5348,2,18,Larry,They're coming for me!
5349,2,18,Stan Marsh,Come on! [the three run away]
5350,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you jagu-ars can be real mean. I'm gonna have to smack it in the face."
5351,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Was the ice man here?
5352,2,18,Eric Cartman,"He might have been, by crikey."
5353,2,18,Agent,"We have to get him back. Well, can you do it?"
5354,2,18,Aussie,[!] Sure I can! I can hunt down anything!
5355,2,18,Eric Cartman,Wow! Kick ass!
5356,2,18,Stan Marsh,"We need a one-way ticket to Des Moines, please."
5357,2,18,Train Station Clerk,Des Moines? What the hell for?
5358,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"We have to get our friend, Steve-"
5359,2,18,Stan Marsh,"My friend, Gorak!"
5360,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"-to Des Moines, or else he's gonna melt away."
5361,2,18,Stan Marsh,"No, he's not gonna melt away! That's Frosty, you stupid butthole!"
5362,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Frosty, Steve, whatever."
5363,2,18,Train Station Clerk,"Well, okay. Uh, I'll find him a seat."
5364,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Dude, look, it's 4 o'clock."
5365,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh. We'll wait for you over there, Steve. We have to start fighting now."
5366,2,18,Larry,"Okay, boys. Thanks."
5367,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. First one to die, loses."
5368,2,18,Stan Marsh,'K.
5369,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Okay. [neither one moves]
5370,2,18,Stan Marsh,O-okay.
5371,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"So, here we go. [puts up his fists]"
5372,2,18,Stan Marsh,'K [puts up his fists]
5373,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Go. [they lock fists and start fighting]
5374,2,18,Aussie,"Wait a second. [bends down, picks up some snow and sniffs at it. Cartman imitates] I think he came through here recently."
5375,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I think the same thing."
5376,2,18,Agent,"Well, where the hell is he? We've got to get him back to the lab."
5377,2,18,Dr Mephesto,He can't function out here in our time!
5378,2,18,Aussie,"[rising] Calm down, calm down."
5379,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, calm down, calm down, you sons of bitches."
5380,2,18,Aussie,Wait! Look!
5381,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Is it him?
5382,2,18,Aussie,"No! It's a Rocky Mountain rattle snake. [curled up on a stump, it hisses] This is the most poisonous snake in this entire region. [quietly] Now, what I'm gonna do, is carefully sneak up on him, and jam my thumb up his butthole. Crikey! [leaps on the snake] Oh, this snake is really pissed!! I'm gonna jam my thumb in his butthole now! [his thumb sticks high in the air, then drops] Awww, yeah, that pissed it off all right!"
5383,2,18,Dr Mephesto,Does he always do this?
5384,2,18,Agent,"[now cross, in a low voice] Yeah."
5385,2,18,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna go jam my thumb in some'in's butthole now.
5386,2,18,Stan Marsh,[punched by Kyle] Ow!
5387,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,[punched in return] Ow! [he throws Stan down]
5388,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Watch my coat, dude."
5389,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Oh.
5390,2,18,Larry,[walks up] I got my ticket.
5391,2,18,Stan Marsh,Huh? [both look at Larry]
5392,2,18,Larry,I have to go to Platform B.
5393,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"[blinks, then] Oh. Okay, it's over this way."
5394,2,18,Aussie,[shows up at the ticket booth with the hunting party] The trail ends here.
5395,2,18,Agent,The train station? Then he's trying to go somewhere.
5396,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"[to the clerk] Have you seen a man who looks similar to us, but with a thicker brow and an apish nose?"
5397,2,18,Train Station Clerk,What the hell are you talking about?
5398,2,18,Dr Mephesto,"An ice man, a man from the past. We must find him. Now, where is he?!"
5399,2,18,Larry,"Well, this is it. I'm going back to my time. Thanks again, boys."
5400,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[panting] No problem, Gorak."
5401,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Later.
5402,2,18,Larry,"You boys have really shown me the true meaning of friendship. You didn't care about anything but my happiness. You put me in front of yourselves, and that's what real friendship is all about."
5403,2,18,Stan Marsh,Yup.
5404,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Uh huh.
5405,2,18,Larry,"After being frozen, I've learned that all a person has in life is family. And friends. If you lose those, you have nothing. So friends are to be treasured, more than anything in the world!"
5406,2,18,Stan Marsh,[panting] Right on.
5407,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Cool.
5408,2,18,Larry,"Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, friends!"
5409,2,18,Dr Mephesto,[rushing up] Where is he? Where is Steve?!
5410,2,18,Stan Marsh,His... name... is... Gorak!
5411,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,His name... is Steve!
5412,2,18,Agent,The train! [it passes the water tower]
5413,2,18,Dr Mephesto,We've got to stop it!
5414,2,18,Aussie,No worries. [cocks his rifle and goes after Larry]
5415,2,18,Agent,Let's get him! [the party gives chase]
5416,2,18,Stan and Kyle,"No! [they stay behind, for a moment]"
5417,2,18,Agent,We've gotta stop that train!
5418,2,18,Aussie,"Come back here, you! [jumps onto the caboose landing]"
5419,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Steve! Steve, look out!"
5420,2,18,Stan Marsh,They're after you!
5421,2,18,Aussie,"Oh, he's a wily one!"
5422,2,18,Larry,"Oh, poo!"
5423,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"Steve, look out!"
5424,2,18,Aussie,"[meeting Larry in his car] Notice the dilated pupils of this prehistoric man. A sure sign the prey is frightened. As well as he should be, as I will now jam my thumb up his butthole."
5425,2,18,Larry,Huh? [the Aussie pounces on him] Whah?!
5426,2,18,Agent,[reaches for the conductor's door] Stop the train!
5427,2,18,Train Conductor,"Hey, who are you?"
5428,2,18,Agent,"I said, stop that train!"
5429,2,18,Train Conductor,"Yes, hello. I see you."
5430,2,18,Eric Cartman,"They're all movin' pretty fast, but I'll catch up to 'em, by crikey."
5431,2,18,Larry,[pins the Aussie] I've got you pinned. I win.
5432,2,18,Aussie,[reverses the pin] Now I've got you pinned. I win!
5433,2,18,Train Conductor,[ducking gunshots from the Agent] Whoa!
5434,2,18,Agent,"[a helicopter comes into view and descends] Hey, it's okay! The helicopter is here! [into a communicator] Go get him, boys! [the pilot acknowledges] Cut him off!"
5435,2,18,Larry,"[pinned on his stomach, his butt in the air] Nooo!"
5436,2,18,Aussie,Now for the coup de gras. I'll just... get my... thumb up... here.
5437,2,18,Larry,"[lets out a long, painful] Oohh!"
5438,2,18,Helicopter Pilot,"Aah, the train's not stopping. [it gets closer...] It's not stopping! [...and closer...] AAAAAAAA!"
5439,2,18,Aussie,[thrown towards the helicopter] Holy bum-!
5440,2,18,Stan Marsh,[catching up] Where's Gorak??
5441,2,18,Helicopter Pilot,"[steps off the chopper] Wow, that is the God-damnedest thing I've ever seen."
5442,2,18,Agent,Where's the ice man?!
5443,2,18,Dr Mephesto,He has to be around here somewhere.
5444,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,I can't believe he's gone.
5445,2,18,Stan Marsh,"[turns around] Wait, look! The helicopter!"
5446,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Hey!
5447,2,18,Stan Marsh,He's alive!
5448,2,18,Larry,[on the bullhorn] Good-bye again! I'm off to Des Moines!
5449,2,18,Dr Mephesto,No! Come back! You can't get out! You'll never live!
5450,2,18,Larry,"I'm not living here! Living is having ups and downs and sharing them with friends! [Stan and Kyle look at each other] Thank you, Stan and Kyle! See ya!"
5451,2,18,Agent,"[leaving with his colleagues] Damn! Well, so much for our plan to use the ice man to take over Sweden."
5452,2,18,Dr Mephesto,[following] What?!
5453,2,18,Agent,What? Nothing!
5454,2,18,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, Steve was a... pretty good name for that guy."
5455,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,"No- Dude, Gorak is cool because it's original. And besides, you found him."
5456,2,18,Eric Cartman,"[still hunting] Be very very quiet. I'm hunting crocodiles, hahahahahaha."
5457,2,18,Stan Marsh,[walks off with Kyle] Could we be best friends again? [Cartman stops] I hate having Cartman as a best friend.
5458,2,18,Kyle Broflovski,Me too. He sucks.
5459,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah?! Well I don't need you guys anyways! You guys can kiss my- [turns left and goes Aussie] Aha! There's a king croc right there! [a cow grazing on a tiny patch of grass. Cartman sneaks up] And what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna sneak up on it, and jam my thumb in its-"
5460,2,18,Cow,Moo!
5461,2,18,Eric Cartman,"Ey! Ey, get me out of here! God-damnit! Ugh. Smells like Kenny's house in here."
