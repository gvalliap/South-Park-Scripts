0,11,1,Announcer,And now back to Wheel of Fortune!
1,11,1,Pat Sajak,"All right, Randy, congratulations on making it all the way to the bonus round!"
2,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Thanks, Pat!"
3,11,1,Pat Sajak,"You've got some family here watching tonight. [a shot of Sharon, Shelly, and Stan in the audience. Sharon waves, then claps. Stan waves]"
4,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, they're all rooting for me."
5,11,1,Pat Sajak,And I'm sure you have lots of friends watching back home?
6,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Yeah. Hi, everybody watching in South Park!"
7,11,1,Jimbo Kern,That's us!
8,11,1,Stephen Stotch,Hehey! [both thumbs up]
9,11,1,Man 1,"[amid other chatter, voice only] Hey Randy!"
10,11,1,Jimbo Kern,Good luck!
11,11,1,Pat Sajak,Well let's see if you can't make everyone proud. The category is [the words appear onscreen as Vanna White gets ready to turn the letters on the board] People Who Annoy You.
12,11,1,Randy Marsh,Okay. [deep exhale]
13,11,1,Pat Sajak,"As always, we give you the letters R, T, S, L, and E. [Some of the letters light up blue and Vanna turns them around: ERS] We just need three more consonants, and a vowel."
14,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Okay I'd like a B, an N, and a G."
15,11,1,Pat Sajak,And a vowel?
16,11,1,Randy Marsh,[quickly crosses his fingers in both hands and grits his teeth] An O please.
17,11,1,Pat Sajak,"Okay, well, looks like you're gonna get a lot of help here. [more letters light up blue and Vanna turns them around. Randy claps softly] The category is People Who Annoy You. [the letters are NGG, but no O: N_GGERS. Randy stops clapping] Audience, keep quiet, please. [one of the cameramen peeks out from behind the camera - he's black]"
18,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Uh... Well, uh..."
19,11,1,Pat Sajak,"Ten seconds, Mr. Marsh."
20,11,1,Randy Marsh,I know it but I don't think I should say it.
21,11,1,Pat Sajak,"Five seconds, Mr. Marsh."
22,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh all right uh, I'd like to solve the puzzle! [beat] Niggers! [the audience is stone quiet. The blacks in it are angry. Randy gets the buzzer for the wrong answer and drops his arms.] Huh? [Vanna goes to turn the last letter around - A - then walks back to her post and looks at the ground] Ohhh..."
23,11,1,Stan Marsh,[covers his eyes] Oooo. [Sharon and Shelly are stunned]
24,11,1,Randy Marsh,"[subdued] Oh naggers. Of course, naggers. [sheepish grin] Right."
25,11,1,Pat Sajak,"[awkwardly] Uhh, can we cut to a... [back at the bar in South Park] Can we cut to a- [the station goes off the air. The bar patrons are confused]"
26,11,1,Randy Marsh,"[sniffs, then] Well? Gave it my best shot. Least we had a fun trip, huh, gang?"
27,11,1,Sharon Marsh,I can't believe you said the N-word on national television.
28,11,1,Randy Marsh,"What? Well what was I supposed to do, Sharon? I thought I was gonna make $30,000! Stanley, the only reason Daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money."
29,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, did your dad know that the show was being broadcast live?"
30,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen. I watched it on YouTube about sixty times."
31,11,1,Stan Marsh,Can we just drop this please? I don't wanna talk about it!
32,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah well, it's not us you have to worry about. It's Token. [points at the camera. Dramatic music swells. The camera then looks at Token, who's putting some books into his locker] He is gonna want to kick your cracker teeth in."
33,11,1,Stan Marsh,No he's not. [looks at Kyle] Is he?
34,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
35,11,1,Stan Marsh,"I just need to explain things. [walks up to Token, who's finished with the locker and holds only a binder in his right hand] Hey Token. Look, I don't know if you saw Wheel of Fortune last night, but-"
36,11,1,Token Black,"Yeah, I was watching with my whole family. And then we saw all the replays this morning on the news."
37,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Listen, Token, my dad isn't a racist. He's just stupid, all right? He just blurted out the N-word, and it's no big deal, okay?"
38,11,1,Token Black,"Uh, well, actually it is kind of a big deal, Stan."
39,11,1,Eric Cartman,Ohhhhhhhh?
40,11,1,Token Black,"It may be a mistake, but you don't understand how it feels when that word comes up. So don't say it isn't a big deal."
41,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh shit here we go! [gets really excited and cuts in between them, yelling] It's on! Race war! [goes back and yells at one end of the hall] Race war! Race war! [comes back again and yells at the other end of the hall] Race war is on, everybody! It's going down! Shit is going down! [returns, just itching to see Stan and Token fight]"
42,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Token, my dad wasn't trying to be offensive. Just forget about it."
43,11,1,Token Black,"That's easy for you to say, Stan."
44,11,1,Eric Cartman,"[softly] Yeah, come on! Here we go!"
45,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but he didn't say it in anger or anything like that."
46,11,1,Token Black,That doesn't mean I can just be fine.
47,11,1,Eric Cartman,[softly] Race war! Come on! Race war!
48,11,1,Token Black,"If you really think it's not a big deal, then you really are ignorant. That's all. I'm not fighting anybody. [turns left and walks away]"
49,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Token forfeits! [takes Stan's left hand and holds it up in victory] Whites win! [lets go and twirls away] Whites win! [runs to one end of the hall] Race war is over, everybody! Whites won again!"
50,11,1,Randy Marsh,"I want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the N-word on Wheel of Fortune. And I want to assure you that I am not a racist, Reverend Jackson. [The camera shows Jesse Jackson behind a desk, with three officials around him]"
51,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"[elbows on armrests, hands interlaced] The puzzle you were solving was ""people who annoy you""."
52,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Uh well, like anybody else thought it was ""naggers"". I mean, right?"
53,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Mr. Marsh, you need to take time to understand African-American culture, visit black museums, see black performers and artists."
54,11,1,Randy Marsh,Oh! Ah I will! I'm really down with [making sure he gets it right] African-Americans.
55,11,1,Jesse Jackson,[thinks a moment] Do you really want to apologize? Are you sure?
56,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Y-Yes, absolutely."
57,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"[long exhale] Very well. If you want to apologize, I will accept. [rises from his chair and approaches Randy]"
58,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Hahh, thank you, Mr. Jackson, thank you."
59,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"Brian, get a picture of Mr. Marsh apologizing. [takes off his coat, rolls up his shirt sleeves...]"
60,11,1,Brian,"[with camera] Ready to go, sir."
61,11,1,Jesse Jackson,"[...unzips and drops his pants, then drops his briefs and sticks his ass out at Randy] Kiss it."
62,11,1,Randy Marsh,Huh?
63,11,1,Jesse Jackson,Apologize. Kiss it.
64,11,1,Randy Marsh,You want me to kiss your-
65,11,1,Jesse Jackson,That's right. [gyrates his butt around] Apologize.
66,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Agh, oh, okay. I'll ahh... [genuflects] Let's see here uh..."
67,11,1,Jesse Jackson,[gyrates his butt around again] Apologize. [Randy kisses Jesse's ass for a few seconds and the picture is taken. It appears in newspapers like the New York News]
68,11,1,Stan Marsh,Hey Token. I just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now. My dad apologized to Jesse Jackson.
69,11,1,Token Black,"Oh I see, so I'm supposed to feel all better now."
70,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Well, yeah."
71,11,1,Token Black,"[throws his backpack into the locker] You just don't get it, Stan!"
72,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Jesse Jackson said it's okay!"
73,11,1,Token Black,"[spins around angrily] Jesse Jackson, is not the emperor, of black people! [storms away]"
74,11,1,Stan Marsh,[softly] He told my dad he was...
75,11,1,Woman at the gym,"[dressed in a sharp business suit] Today we are going to have a guest speaker talk to us about sensitivity and the power of words. [Stan looks over at Token in the row before him] In a moment you will meet Dr. David Nelson, who has first-hand experience in overcoming slander, because David is himself, a little person. Who knows what a little person is? [Butters raises his hand] Yes? Over here?"
76,11,1,Butters Stotch,A midget?
77,11,1,Woman at the gym,"Not exactly. That term is actually considered offensive, and that's why Dr. Nelson goes from school to school getting us all to think about what we say. He has two PhD.'s and has published six books! Please welcome David Nelson!"
78,11,1,Mr Nelson,"[waddles in to some fanfare, swaying back and forth] Good morning, students! How are we all feeling today? [the music stops. Cartman chuckles, then lets out a laugh, and can't stop] I would like to share with you all my-"
79,11,1,Eric Cartman,No! Dude! No fucking way! [laughs] Dude! [resumes laughing]
80,11,1,Mr Nelson,"That, that words are like bullets. And if you give-"
81,11,1,Eric Cartman,"[shakes his head back and forth, then rears back, laughing all the while] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stohahahahahahaha..."
82,11,1,Mr Mackey,"[appears next to Mr. Nelson] Eric, be quiet!"
83,11,1,Mr Nelson,"No, no, it's okay. He'll run out of steam here pretty soon. [Cartman continues laughing, and even nudges Stan a few times to get him to laugh, but Stan just gets annoyed.]"
84,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Look! Look look, look. They put a little suit on him. [resumes laughing. Mr. Nelson gets pissed off, but holds it in]"
85,11,1,Randy Marsh,Ooh! An African-American performer at the comedy club. [rushes over]
86,11,1,"Coyote Brown, Laugh Factory Comedian","And so I said to my wife, ""You told me to kill the damned cockroach! Don't yell at me for making a mess!"" [the audience laughs. Randy is in the audience, laughing] We've got a great crowd here tonight. Now, how many people here are actually from Colorado? [a few audience members and Randy clap and holler] Ya got nothin' better to do on a Friday night than to go to a comedy club, huh? [that gets a big laugh from the crowd. The comedian points to Randy] Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? [the crowd falls silent, and Randy looks uncomfortable] Yeah. I know you. You're the guy that said ""nigger"" on Wheel of Fortune. [the audience laughs. Randy lets out a weak chuckle] Look! Everybody! It's the ""nigger"" guy. [big laughs all around]"
87,11,1,Man 2,"Hey, it is him."
88,11,1,"Coyote Brown, Laugh Factory Comedian","Oh, we got a star in the club. Everyone wave to the ""nigger"" guy. [waves, and the audience waves with him] Say, ""Hi, 'nigger' guy!"""
89,11,1,Audience,"Hi, ""nigger"" guy! [Randy waves back and now has a guilty smile on his face, which quickly changes to a guilty frown]"
90,11,1,"Coyote Brown, Laugh Factory Comedian","That's all right, ""nigger"" guy. You know we just playin'. [the crowd roars with laughter and claps]"
91,11,1,Randy Marsh,Yeah... No problem...
92,11,1,"Coyote Brown, Laugh Factory Comedian","Have you all seen these navigation systems in these cars these days? Damn things look like they're right out of ""Far Out Space Nuts"". Maybe ""nigger"" guy has one. You got one, ""nigger"" guy? [the audience roars with laughter again and Randy leaves, his head hung in shame. He wanders the streets]"
93,11,1,Man 3,"[walks by with a woman] Hey look, Betty. It's that ""nigger"" guy. [Randy sighs and walks on]"
94,11,1,Three kids,"[passing by on skateboards] Nigger guy. Nigger guy. [they leave, Randy sighs again and walks on. He stops by a 24-hour store to get some aspirin]"
95,11,1,Convenience Store Clerk,[white] Hey. What do you think you're doing? [an Asian clerk stands behind him]
96,11,1,Randy Marsh,I just... need some aspirin.
97,11,1,Convenience Store Clerk,"You aren't welcome in this store, ""nigger"" guy."
98,11,1,Randy Marsh,Fine! [leaves the aspirin on the counter and rushes out the door]
99,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Principal Victoria, I am very concerned about the behavior of one of your students."
100,11,1,Principal Victoria,"Yes, we apologize for Eric Cartman's behavior, Mr. Nelson. We feel terrible."
101,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Why? I don't feel terrible. It doesn't bother me at all. [waddles to his left] Words are like bullets, and I let 'em pass right through me. [waddles back] I just know that with some one-on-one time together with this Eric Cartman, I have a chance to change the way he thinks."
102,11,1,Mr Mackey,"Uh, it might be best if you just ...let it go, m'kay?"
103,11,1,Mr Nelson,"You don't understand. [waddles around] You see, words are like bullets. And if you take away the gunpowder-"
104,11,1,Mr Mackey,"Yeah yeah, we we get it, Mr. Nelson."
105,11,1,Principal Victoria,"Very well, Mr. Nelson. [presses a button on her phone] Stacey, go ahead and send in Eric Cartman. [the door opens and Cartman walks in and immediately bursts into laughter upon seeing Mr. Nelson.] Eric, Mr. Nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people."
106,11,1,Eric Cartman,[stops long enough to respond] Oh. Did I hurt its little feelings? [resumes laughing]
107,11,1,Mr Nelson,"You know, you think you have the power to make me insecure, but your words are actually completely powerless."
108,11,1,Eric Cartman,"[before Mr. Nelson finishes talking] Oh oh oh oh! If we could get, like, eight of these, we could dress them all up like little beavers, right, and then put 'em in a pond, and see if they build a dam! [stomps his foot on the floor, points to Mr. Nelson, and laughs. Principal Victoria buries her face in her hands]"
109,11,1,Mr Nelson,"You see? No matter what you say, I'm still standing."
110,11,1,Eric Cartman,[stops] Barely! [starts up again]
111,11,1,Mr Nelson,"[assertively] No matter how you act, I can rise above it!"
112,11,1,Eric Cartman,"[stops] ""Rise above it!"" Get it? [starts up again]"
113,11,1,Mr Nelson,[steps up to Cartman] Shut your fucking mouth!
114,11,1,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Nelson! [Mr. Nelson blanches. Cartman looks at him, then cracks up again and falls on his ass in laughter]"
115,11,1,Mr Nelson,"He, he, he didn't get to me. I was I was just I wast just joking"
116,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Look, look how its face gets all red! He's like a little strawberry!"
117,11,1,Mr Nelson,[grimaces] Aaaaaaa!
118,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Words with venom, words that bind. Words used like weapons to cloud my mind. I'm a person. I'm a man. But no matter how I try, people just say ""Hey! There's that 'nigger' guy."" [no response from the crowd] Everywhere I go, it's always the same. Everyone just thinks of me as that one single name. ""Hey Nigger Guy! Nigger Guy! Hi Nigger Guy!"" Stop! Now go. Call me Nigger Guy! Fill me with your hate! Try to bring me down- Oop up, you're too late. When will it end, will there ever be a time? When I can be thought of as more... than just ""Nigger Guy"". [no response from the crowd] Respect. [throws up the V sign and walks off stage]"
119,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Token! Hey, wait up. [Token turns around] I just wanted to say, I get it now. You know, after that ""little person"" talk at that assembly the other day, I understand how you feel about somebody saying the N word."
120,11,1,Token Black,Sooo black people are midgets? [turns around and walks away. At the far end of the hallway Mr. Nelson rounds the corner and walks towards Stan.]
121,11,1,Stan Marsh,God dammit!
122,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Excuse me, over here, please? All right, I need all students to join me over here. [heads towards the gym. The available students follow him]"
123,11,1,Mr Nelson,"I have called you here because it is time that we taught Eric Cartman a lesson once and for all! In a few seconds, Eric will be sent in, and when we walks through that door, I want you all at the same time to yell, ""Hello, fatso!"""
124,11,1,Craig Tucker,"...I don't think that's a very good idea, sir."
125,11,1,Mr Nelson,"He has to learn his lesson! You see, words are like bullets. [turns around and sees Cartman] All right all right, here he comes. [walks off-screen. Cartman enters the gym]"
126,11,1,Three Kids,"""Hello, fatso!"""
127,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey! What the hell is that?! You think that's fuckin' funny?! [walks up to Kyle accusingly] Kyle, did you put everybody up to this?! [Mr. Nelson walks out towards the entrance, then curves around to stand behind Cartman] I bet you did! What the hell is going on?!"
128,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Now you know how it feels. [Cartman turns around and looks at him, then bursts out laughing] You'd better shut up or i'm gonna kick your ass!"
129,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Alright, alright, alright, who is the freaking genius who dressed it up in little suspenders? Clyde, was that you? Gahahahahaha!"
130,11,1,Randy Marsh,"And so it is my honor to announce today the Randy Marsh African-American Scholarship Foundation. [gets good applause for that] It is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of African-American students and erase once and for all my identity as the ""nigger"" guy. [no response] You really... you really don't know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past. I mean I... just wanna move on from what happened on ""Wheel of Fortune"", you know and... and when people call me... ""nigger guy""... they're bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it. You just... you can't imagine how that feels. [no response]"
131,11,1,Black Man in convention audience,"Is this ""nigger"" guy serious?"
132,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Anyway, here's to a new start for us all. Thank you! [walks off.]"
133,11,1,Driver,Thar look Skeeter! That's that guy from the TV!
134,11,1,Skeeter,"[the redneck in the cab] Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a nigger guy! [reaches down and grabs a shotgun. Randy takes off running.]"
135,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Awww! Awwww! [the rednecks give chase. Skeeter just shoots in the air, aiming at no one]"
136,11,1,Skeeter,Yee haw! Yiiip yip yip yip yip yip.
137,11,1,Passenger,Wooo! [pumps his left fist]
138,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Whoa! [sees a clearing across the street and runs into it. The truck passes it, screeches to a halt, and backs up. Randy turns around and sees the three rednecks standing before him, shotguns aimed at him]"
139,11,1,Skeeter,"Where you goin' ""nigger"" guy?"
140,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Please I, I don't want any trouble."
141,11,1,Skeeter,"Well you got trouble, when you first decided to slander an entire race of people on ""Wheel of Fortune""!"
142,11,1,Driver,"Yeah. You like making fun of minorities, ""nigger"" guy? Huh we don't take kindly to social ignorance."
143,11,1,Passenger,"You tell 'im, Skeeter, you tell 'im!"
144,11,1,Randy Marsh,[holds his hands out in a blocking position] What do you want?
145,11,1,Skeeter,What do we want? [he and the passenger laugh] We want to live in a world without people like you who are intolerant of African-Americans!
146,11,1,Man 4,"[from screen left, out of nowhere] Leave him alone."
147,11,1,Passenger,"Hey... That's that other ""nigger"" guy."
148,11,1,Skeeter,Huh?
149,11,1,Passenger,"That's the guy from Seinfeld, used the N-word a whole bunch o' times."
150,11,1,Driver,"Michael Richards? Well, son of a bitch!"
151,11,1,Skeeter,"Looks like it's our lucky day! We done got us two ""nigger"" guys!"
152,11,1,Man 5,[from screen right] Make that three.
153,11,1,Passenger,Mark Fuhrman?
154,11,1,Skeeter,Who?
155,11,1,Passenger,He done said the N-word in the O.J. case.
156,11,1,Driver,"Well what is this? A ""nigger"" guy convention? [two more men appear beside Randy, Richards and Fuhrman]"
157,11,1,Michael Richards,We aren't being pushed around anymore. Leave.
158,11,1,Driver,"Come on, Skeeter. [he and the other rednecks back up towards their truck] These ""nigger"" guys ain't worth our trouble."
159,11,1,Skeeter,"[from the truck bed] Damn ""nigger"" guys! [the other two get into the cab] We'll be back! [the truck starts up and the rednecks hoot and holler and fire off their weapons as they speed away]"
160,11,1,Michael Richards,[puts his hands on Randy's right shoulder] You'd better come with us.
161,11,1,Michael Richards,"Come on in, Mr. Marsh. We'll make you some coffee."
162,11,1,Randy Marsh,What's going on here?
163,11,1,Mark Fuhrman,[pours Randy a cup of coffee and gives it to him] We've been following your story since we first saw it on the news. Don't worry - you're with friends now. Dale here used the N-word in a racial joke at work. Scott used the plural N-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence.
164,11,1,Scott,They were Mexicans. I was being ironic.
165,11,1,Michael Richards,We're all just like you.
166,11,1,Randy Marsh,"No. [smacks Richards' hand off his shoulder and puts the cup down] No no, I'm sorry, but I'm not... like you. I just said the N-word by mistake to win money."
167,11,1,Michael Richards,I made a mistake too. [moves forward a bit] I was trying to be funny! I got frustrated and thought I would get some shock laughs. I'm just... not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth.
168,11,1,Randy Marsh,You said the N-word to a black man's face! That's way worse than what I did!
169,11,1,Michael Richards,"[turns around and gets in Randy's face] You really think that matters?! [moves to Randy's ear] You really think all those people out there see a difference? Oh, they might say your racial slur was more accidental; they might even laugh about it. But at the end of the day, all you are to them is just another damn ""nigger"" guy! [Randy swallows a bit] Oh, you don't like that, do ya?"
170,11,1,Randy Marsh,No.
171,11,1,Mark Fuhrman,"Randy, we want you to join us. We have a plan to make this all go away once and for all."
172,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Now look, Token, I've done everything I can to make this right! You have no reason to still be mad!"
173,11,1,Token Black,I have every reason to be mad! You just don't get it!
174,11,1,Stan Marsh,I'm not responsible for what my dad did!
175,11,1,Token Black,"No, but you can't just pretend it never happened either!"
176,11,1,Stan Marsh,"What the hell do you want from me?! [Butters appears across the street, rather out of breath. Upon seeing them, he runs over]"
177,11,1,Token Black,Nothing!
178,11,1,Stan Marsh,Then stop being mad!
179,11,1,Token Black,No!
180,11,1,Butters Stotch,"Fellas! Fellas come quick! Cartman's gonna fight the midget! [Butters runs off. Stan and Token look at each other silently then shrug, as they turn to follow Butters]"
181,11,1,Butters Stotch,"C'mon now Eric, come on now."
182,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate."
183,11,1,Eric Cartman,"It's a midget, dude."
184,11,1,Mr Nelson,"[""Down with the Sickness"" by Disturbed starts playing] Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point."
185,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Hahaha, no- no dude. It can't talk, that isn't fair, I'll laugh too much. [the kids urge them to fight, and the match begins]"
186,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Senators, I know it is not normally considered ""American"" to ban words. [Randy is flanked by Fuhrman and Richards] But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I'm talking, of course, about the term ""nigger guy""."
187,11,1,Senator 1,"""Nigger guy""?"
188,11,1,Randy Marsh,Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.
189,11,1,Michael Richards,Yeah! That's right!
190,11,1,Randy Marsh,Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking it's no big deal - but they don't realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.
191,11,1,Skeeter,[with his two friends] Goddamn nigger guy's tryin' to be all political-like now!
192,11,1,Randy Marsh,"Senators, I've learned to admit that I'm capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called ""nigger guys""? [the senators are somewhat shocked]"
193,11,1,Senator 2,"Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that ""nigger guy"" could become a slur that refers to all white people?"
194,11,1,Senator 3,I'm certainly not a nigger guy. I've never thought a racist thought.
195,11,1,Senator 4,"[black senator] Aw, come on, you're the biggest nigger guy in Washington."
196,11,1,Senator 1,"Mr. Marsh, we see now the importance of your bill. [raises his left hand] All those in favor to ban the term ""nigger guy""?"
197,11,1,Most Senators,Aye!
198,11,1,Senator 1,Opposed?
199,11,1,Senator 4,[a lone black senator] Nay?
200,11,1,Senator 1,The motion is passed! [lowers the gavel.]
201,11,1,Randy Marsh,We did it!
202,11,1,Field Reporter,"For the first time in American history, a word has been officially banned from use."
203,11,1,Senator 3,"From now on, if a person uses the word ""nigger,"" it must be at least seven words away from the word ""guy."" [a group of black people is shown, not reacting in any way to the announcement. Everyone else continues cheering.]"
204,11,1,Field Reporter,"Tom, it appears that the nigger guy epidemic is ove- [two police officers come and take him away] Oh dammit I said it, didn't I?"
205,11,1,Mr Nelson,"AAAA! Ow! Ow! Okay! [Cartman punches him in the face a few times] Okay, you win!"
206,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Say ""Uncle!"""
207,11,1,Mr Nelson,Ung-cle!
208,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Hahaha, now say ""Carol Anne, don't go into the light!"""
209,11,1,Mr Nelson,"Carol Anne, don't go into the light!"
210,11,1,Eric Cartman,"Haaha, hahahahahaha! Oh man, that is hysterical! [Mr. Nelson rises and pummels him in the back of the head. Cartman falls forward] Oh!"
211,11,1,Mr Nelson,There! Now you all see that I am not limited by my size. [Cartman comes alive again and laughs] I have proven my point! My work here is done! [waddles away. The kids begin to disperse]
212,11,1,Stan Marsh,What was his point?
213,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,I have no idea.
214,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't get it."
215,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,I don't get it either.
216,11,1,Stan Marsh,[comes to a certain realization] Wait a minute. That's it! I don't get it.
217,11,1,Kyle Broflovski,...Huh?
218,11,1,Stan Marsh,"Don't you see, Kyle? I don't get it! [smiles, then walks up to Token] Token, I get it now. I don't get it. I've been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I'll never understand. I'll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word. I don't get it."
219,11,1,Token Black,"Now you get it, Stan. [smiles]"
220,11,1,Stan Marsh,[smiles] Yeah. I totally don't get it.
221,11,1,Token Black,"Thanks, dude."
222,11,2,Eric Cartman,"This picture I like to call ""The Pierre"". I invited Butters to stay the night, and while he was sleeping I made a mustache on his face with cat poo. Hahahahaha. [the caption reads ""THE PIERRE 3/10/07."" Cartman flips the page. The pages are artsy in design] And this time, when Butters stayed the night, I put a tampon in his mouth. [Yep, the tampon is in there like a thermometer] I call this picture ""The Sleeping Menstrual"". [the caption is shown, Cartman flips the page. Kyle, Stan, and Kenny stand around him, looking at the pictures. They're all in Cartman's room.] This one, I call ""Hot Fudge Mondae"". [caresses the picture] I really like how the light plays with the background on this one."
223,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Is this all you brought us here to see?
224,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh no, there's much more. [flips the page] Let's see- Oh yes, look at this one: I call it ""New Moon Rising"". [a shot of Cartman hanging his ass over Butters' face] I did a whole study using my ass. [Cartman's ass over Butters' face from the left side] Here it is using some high-contrast stuff. [next, Cartman wearing darker pajamas, mooning Butters] trying out some... different light filters here. [last shot looks faded, with Cartman's ass directly on Butters' face.] But this is nothing compared to what I have planned. Because tonight... is going to be my coop de grass."
225,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Butters is staying over tonight?
226,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Yes. And tonight, while Butters is asleep, I am going to-"
227,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[appears at Cartman's bedroom door] Hey, fellas! [Stan and Kenny turn around. Kyle looks over his left shoulder]"
228,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Heh! [quickly puts away his scrapbook] Oh, oh hey, Butters! [turns around and greets him] I wasn't expecting you so soon."
229,11,2,Butters Stotch,Yeah. [puts down his sleeping bag] I finished my chores so I came over a little early. [Cartman takes the sleeping bag and sets it aside. Butters notices the other guys] Hey! Are you guys all sleepin' over too?
230,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[returns] No no, these guys were just leaving. [faces the other guys menacingly] weren't you guys?"
231,11,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go. [leads Kyle and Kenny out the door.]"
232,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops] Wait, wai- I can't let this happen. [turns around] Butters."
233,11,2,Butters Stotch,Yeah Kyle?
234,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you think it's a little strange that Cartman keeps asking you to stay over?
235,11,2,Eric Cartman,Kyyyle!
236,11,2,Butters Stotch,Uh what do you mean?
237,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"I mean, that if-"
238,11,2,Eric Cartman,"What he means is that he's jealous that you've taken his place as my new best friend! But grow up, Kyle! Change is a part of life."
239,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Heh yeah, grow up, Kyle."
240,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,[angered] Hrrugh! [leaves]
241,11,2,Butters Stotch,"So what do you wanna do first, Eric? You wanna play a game or just chitchat for a while?"
242,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon."
243,11,2,Butters Stotch,"But, uh-ih-it's only 6:30."
244,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and I'm exhausted. If you are not sleepy yet, I have some more of that nighttime cold medicine you can drink."
245,11,2,Eric Cartman,[off screen] You guys! I got it! [runs in and joins them] It seriously! It's the greatest picture ever! Oh my God!
246,11,2,Stan Marsh,What'cha do to Butters this time?
247,11,2,Eric Cartman,"It was genius! I waited 'til he was totally asleep, right? And then I got my camera, and I pulled down his pants, and then I took a picture of his wiener in my mouth! [cracks up at his own cleverness]"
248,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Dude!
249,11,2,Eric Cartman,"I know I know, check it out, look. [the other three crowd in and look at the picture] I got his whole wiener in my mouth, see? Heheh. Oh man, I got him good!"
250,11,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, how is putting Butters' wiener in his mouth getting him?"
251,11,2,Eric Cartman,Because that makes Butters gay now!
252,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, that makes you gay!"
253,11,2,Eric Cartman,Eh- ...what?
254,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"You put a guy's wiener in your mouth, that makes you gay, stupid!"
255,11,2,Eric Cartman,[looks more closely at the picture] Nuh uh.
256,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah huh!
257,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, that doesn't make me gay, huh?"
258,11,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Ehe, that makes you very fucking gay.)"
259,11,2,Eric Cartman,"But I'm not g-I'm not gay, you guys!"
260,11,2,Stan Marsh,You are now.
261,11,2,Eric Cartman,"No, no, it was a stupid mistake!"
262,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Doesn't matter. You're gay now.
263,11,2,Eric Cartman,"No, it was just for a second! [seeing that his plan has backfired, he puts the picture away] What, what can I do? How how can I reverse this?"
264,11,2,Stan Marsh,You can't!
265,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Nono wait. I I know how you can reverse it, Cartman."
266,11,2,Eric Cartman,How?
267,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,The only way you can cancel it out is to get Butters to put your wiener in his mouth.
268,11,2,Eric Cartman,[low voice] Really?
269,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Then it cancels out the gay polarity.
270,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[beat] ...Shit, I gotta find Butters! [runs off]"
271,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,[beat] ...Idiot.
272,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[singing] Help me, I thinking I'm falling in love with you... [continues howling the tune]"
273,11,2,Eric Cartman,[enters the room] Butters.
274,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[stops playing and gets up] Whoa, hey Eric."
275,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, guess what? I have a surprise for you."
276,11,2,Butters Stotch,[a little excited] A surprise? What is it?
277,11,2,Eric Cartman,It's so fuckin' awesome. You're gonna be so stoked. It's the best surprise ever!
278,11,2,Butters Stotch,[really excited] Oh boy!
279,11,2,Eric Cartman,You ready?
280,11,2,Butters Stotch,Y-yeah!
281,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay! Just open your mouth and close your eyes and, and get on your knees!"
282,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[closes his eyes, opens his mouth, and gets on his knees] Oh, okay! [Cartman grabs a handkerchief from his back pocket and makes a blindfold from it, then puts it on Butters]"
283,11,2,Eric Cartman,Hang on a second here. [makes sure the blindfold is on snugly]
284,11,2,Butters Stotch,"How come uh, I can't see?"
285,11,2,Eric Cartman,"'Cause then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? [rushes off to get the toybox]"
286,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh uh, ho yeah."
287,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] All right, that's good. [undoes his pants] Okay, open your mouth, Butters? [lowers them and ...] That's good, just like that."
288,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[wary all of a sudden] Hey. Hey wait a minute. This ain't a trick, is it? Why you're not gonna, eh stick something icky in my mouth, are ya?"
289,11,2,Eric Cartman,"...I swear on my mother's life, Butters. I am not going to stick anything icky in your mouth. [lifts up his shirt to show his massive gut]"
290,11,2,Butters Stotch,Well okay!
291,11,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, you ready? [grabs Butters' head and draws it closer to his own wiener] All right just- okay, open uh- okay, okay, here it comes. Just sit very still, okay? Here we go. [at that moment the door opens and Stephen enters.]"
292,11,2,Stephen Stotch,Butters!
293,11,2,Eric Cartman,Uh! [quickly gets dressed up]
294,11,2,Butters Stotch,Whoa! Hey Dad! [Cartman steps down from the toy-box and runs away]
295,11,2,Stephen Stotch,Butters! What are you doing?!
296,11,2,Butters Stotch,I'm getting a surprise! [points to his mouth]
297,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"Oh my God! My, my only son, reduced to this! [takes off the blindfold]"
298,11,2,Butters Stotch,[looks around] Hey. Where'd Eric go?
299,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"[quite concerned, on bended knee] Butters, how long have you been doing stuff like this?"
300,11,2,Butters Stotch,Like what?
301,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"Don't lie to me, Butters! I know your secret now! No wait, wait. It's okay. It's okay, Butters. This isn't a serious problem. You're just bi-curious."
302,11,2,Butters Stotch,What's... bi-curious?
303,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"You are. Just harmless curiosity, and it doesn't mean anything. We just need to get you some help, Butters. [Linda appears at the doorway]"
304,11,2,Linda Stotch,"What's going on, you two?"
305,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Nothin' Mom, I'm just a little bi-curious. [smiles]"
306,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"Father Maxi, I... just don't know where else to turn. You see, I've just learned that my son is... bi-curious."
307,11,2,Father Maxi,"Is that true, son? Are you feeling... confused?"
308,11,2,Butters Stotch,"...Yeah, I'm pretty confused alright."
309,11,2,Stephen Stotch,You see?
310,11,2,Father Maxi,"Young man, These confused feelings that you're having are simply the Devil's way of trying to get a hold of you."
311,11,2,Butters Stotch,Really?
312,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"What can I do, Father?"
313,11,2,Father Maxi,"There is a special camp where young men who are confused, like your son, can go and be cleansed by the power of God. Many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured."
314,11,2,Stephen Stotch,A secluded camp where lots of bi-curious boys are all put together? That sounds like a good idea.
315,11,2,Butters Stotch,Whoa boy! Camp!
316,11,2,Eric Cartman,Haahaahahaha! [crosses his arms] Very funny! I suppose you really think you got me!
317,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you talking about, fatass?"
318,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[uncrosses his arms] I checked on the Internet, Kyyyle, and getting Butters to put my wiener in his mouth wouldn't make me not gay like you said!"
319,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"You figured that out, huh?"
320,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[crosses his arms again as he turns away] That's right. And I also learned from the Internet that just because I put Butters' wiener in my mouth doesn't mean I'm gay! All I have to do is throw away the picture, forget it ever happened, and nobody will ever know. [pleased with himself]"
321,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Except for us.
322,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Right, except for you."
323,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,And all the people we tell.
324,11,2,Eric Cartman,[turns around] Why would you tell anybody?
325,11,2,Stan Marsh,"Because it's really, really funny."
326,11,2,Eric Cartman,"...It's not that funny. There's lots, there's lots of things that are way funnier."
327,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Like what?
328,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Liiike... a tampon... in the school cafeteria... in, in somebody's lunch. [grins, but Stan and Kyle ignore him] Liiike, a, a dog crap... on, on a guy's face! [chuckles]"
329,11,2,Stan Marsh,That isn't funny.
330,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[angrily] Yes it is! Now you guys, I'm getting pissed off! You'd better not tell anybody!"
331,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, maybe we will, maybe we won't."
332,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Fine! Whatever! You guys don't have any proof I put Butters' wiener in my mouth! It will be your word against mine! And we all know that everyone trusts me way more than you guys! [the other boys continue playing. Cartman changes tactics: he pleads] You guys, please don't tell anybody."
333,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay. We won't tell anybody as long as you are super nice to us, every day, from now on."
334,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh right, like that's possible! Alright, fine! You know what I'm gonna do, Kyle?! I'm gonna go home, and photo shop the picture so that it is your face with Butters' wiener in his mouth here! And if ANY of you say anything to anybody, I'll simply show them the picture of Kyle. [turns around and cackles] Haha, hahahaha! [leaves the house]"
335,11,2,Leader,"Everyone, say hello to our new camper, Butters."
336,11,2,Campers,Hi Butters. Hello. Hi. Hello Butters.
337,11,2,Stephen Stotch,[brings the suitcase to an elder staffer] Thank you so much for taking him in.
338,11,2,Director,Don't worry. Your son just needs to learn that he can be straight if he chooses to be.
339,11,2,Director,"Do you know why you're here at camp, Butters?"
340,11,2,Butters Stotch,Because I'm bi-curious?
341,11,2,Director,"That's right. Like all the campers here, you're confused, and you don't think there's a way out. But even though some people would have you believe you can't control how you feel, the truth is that with the power of Jesus Christ you can be normal. Now, just to make sure you don't slip up while in camp we assign every camper an accountabilibuddy. [they approach a room] Let's meet Ryan, your accountabilibuddy. [Room 22] Ryan thought he could never change. But now he's learning that with the power of Christ and prayer, he can have a whole new life. [the door opens, and a boy is shown hanging from a noose in the middle of his room. The stool and book he stood on are fallen on the floor. The director quickly closes the door and continues the tour] Over this way we have the cafeteria. All the meals are served there. [notices another boy in front of them] Uh Bradley! How about you be Butters' accountabilibuddy?"
342,11,2,Bradley,"Humble yourselves therefore under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up. - Peter 5:6"
343,11,2,Director,Butters here is new to the camp. He's chosen to rid himself of his affliction and forge a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
344,11,2,Butters Stotch,I'm bi-curious.
345,11,2,Bradley,Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman: that is detestable. - Leviticus 18:22.
346,11,2,Director,"That's right, Bradley. I think we're well on our way to being healed. [(a boy has hanged himself) whispers softly to a staffer as the staffer walks by] We've got another one: Room 22."
347,11,2,Staffer,"Aw, darnit!"
348,11,2,Stan Marsh,"Aw man, I've got H O R S now. [steps aside as Kenny receives the ball.]"
349,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, my turn. [Kenny gives him the ball and Kyle prepares to shoot. Cartman approaches the park behind him]"
350,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Where is it, you filthy Jew?!"
351,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,[throws up the ball] Where's what?
352,11,2,Eric Cartman,[grabs Kyle by the collar and shakes him violently] You know God damned well what!
353,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Let go of me.
354,11,2,Stan Marsh,"What the hell are you doing, Cartman?!"
355,11,2,Eric Cartman,"I went home to alter the picture of me with Butters' penis in my mouth to look like Kyle, but it was gone! [shakes Kyle again] What did you do with my picture?!"
356,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Knock it off! I don't have your stupid picture.
357,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[rolls up his sleeves] Give it back, Kyle!"
358,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,I don't have it.
359,11,2,Eric Cartman,"I swear to God, Kyle, if you don't give it back right now, [puts up his fists as if to box] I'm gonna break your fuckin' Jew legs right here."
360,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,Shut up.
361,11,2,Eric Cartman,"You shut up! You're lying, and [points an accusing finger at Stan and Kenny] you two are covering up for him! You know what? You're just like Jews yourselves! Stan, you're a Jew, and Kenny, you're a Jew! You're all Jews! [Kyle punches him on the right arm once, firmly] OW! [puts his left hand over his right arm] OW! AAAAUH! [grimaces, turns around, and runs out of the park] NYAAAAAAAAAA!"
362,11,2,Campers,The Lord is love this forWith Jesus I can just say noAnd not be confused anymore.
363,11,2,Director,"We will now hear a sermon from Pastor Phillips. For those of you who are new to camp, Pastor Phillips is somebody who has broken free of the bonds that afflict you."
364,11,2,Butters Stotch,He's bi-curious too?
365,11,2,Director,"Not anymore. Because Pastor Phillips prayed, and by the hand of Jesus Christ, he's now completely cured! Let's hear it for Pastor Phillips, kids!"
366,11,2,Pastor Phillips,"[flies onto the stage and prances about speaking flamboyantly] Helloooo campers! [twirls some and strikes a pose] Yeth, believe it or not, I mythelf used to have unclean urges, and like a lot of you, I thought I was just made that way, that I didn't have a choice. But then I realized that God didn't want me to be that way! God wanted me to be a man! [strikes a running pose] So I buckled up in my little suit and I prayed to be normal and guess what? [jumps up into the air and does a 1080] It worrrrked! [strikes another pose, then eases up]"
367,11,2,Director,"That's right, kids. You see, right now you're like a paper clip. [pulls on out of his back pocket] And just like a paper clip, [begins to mess with it] God needs to bend you, and shape you, and make youuuu... straight. [presents the straightened paper clip. A Latino boy pulls out a gun, shoots himself through the temple, and goes down. Butters is startled. The director and Pastor Phillips just stand there.]"
368,11,2,Det Yates,So you say you were robbed. [fills out a police report]
369,11,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. A photograph. And I know who took it! His name is Kyle Broflovski.
370,11,2,Det Yates,"If it's a photo, what's the big deal? Why don't you just print out another one?"
371,11,2,Eric Cartman,"It's a big deal, okay?! That picture is my propertih, and I want it back!"
372,11,2,Det Yates,"Okay, what is the picture of?"
373,11,2,Eric Cartman,[long pause] Why... why does that matter?
374,11,2,Det Yates,Well how are we gonna find your picture unless we know what it is?
375,11,2,Eric Cartman,All right. It's a picture ...of me.
376,11,2,Det Yates,Yes?
377,11,2,Eric Cartman,It's a picture ...of me. [long pause] And um... what appears to be... a penis... in my mouth.
378,11,2,Det Yates,[long pause] You were sucking somebody's penis. [this grabs other officers' attention.]
379,11,2,Eric Cartman,"No, no I was not! I was asleep, and this person just... put their penis in my mouth without me knowing! And and took the picture!"
380,11,2,Det Yates,...I see.
381,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Yes. Now it may appear in the picture... that I'm actually looking at the camera lens and smiling, with the penis in my mouth. And giving a thumbs up. But I assure you, I was fast asleep."
382,11,2,Det Yates,"Well we'd have to get a warrant first, approved by a grand jury."
383,11,2,Eric Cartman,I don't have time for that! We have school tomorrow! And I know that Kyle is gonna show the picture to everybody during Show and Tell!
384,11,2,Det Yates,"Well then, you're screwed."
385,11,2,Director,You both do understand that we're trying to save your souls from eternal life in hell?
386,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Well sure, I guess."
387,11,2,Bradley,Only through Christ can we cleanse our souls.
388,11,2,Director,And you do know the rule which states that no impure or immoral images are allowed to be seen by the eye?
389,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, sure."
390,11,2,Bradley,"So let's purify ourselves from everything that makes the body or soul unclean. - Corinthians, chapter 7."
391,11,2,Director,Then do you mind telling us why we found this [holds up a magazine with an aroused male model on one of its pages] 1979 Sears men's underwear catalog... in your room?
392,11,2,Bradley,That's... that's mine.
393,11,2,Director,You know this is strictly forbidden!
394,11,2,Butters Stotch,Ah I don't understand. What's wrong with underwear?
395,11,2,Director,"[rises from his chair and walks up to Butters] What's wrong?! [thrusts the magazine onto Butters' face] This is what makes you confused! Don't you get it?! This is confusing you right now, isn't it?!"
396,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Yes, it's all very confusing!"
397,11,2,Director,"This is just as much your fault, Butters! Bradley is your accountabilibuddy! That makes you accountabilibuddyable. Both of your boys' behavior has jeopardizing all of the work we're doing here to save these kids! [a gunshot and body drop are heard off screen and all the adults present look to their right. The director sighs twice, rests his left elbow on his desk, holds his left hand up, drops his head onto it, and closes his eyes. The other staffers take notice. Bradley looks down, Butters looks down, then around] Right. For having contraband in your room, you will both do penance by writing scripture for the next four days!"
398,11,2,Eric Cartman,That son of a bitch. He's gonna show everyone that picture. Only twelve hours from now. [pounds his desk and gets determined] That's it. I don't have a choice. I'm gonna have to bring Mom in on this one! I'm just... going to have to tell her the truth. [grabs his ears and starts twisting them until they hurt] Ow. OW. OW!
399,11,2,Liane Cartman,"[taking notice] Eric? What's the, what's the matter? [walks over to him to console him]"
400,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[crying throughout] I, don't, want to go to school tomorrow."
401,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Sweetie, shhh, tell Mommy what happened."
402,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, has a picture of me, and he's gonna show everyone during Show and Tell, and, everyone's gonna laugh at meeee."
403,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, now why would he do that?"
404,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Because, he's jealous of how much smarter I am than him. So, he's gonna show everyone the picturrrre."
405,11,2,Liane Cartman,"What is the picture of, Eric? [Cartman stops crying]"
406,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[sniffles] Last time, when Butters stayed the night, I was being really nice to him and I was... gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have."
407,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Ohh, that's nice."
408,11,2,Eric Cartman,"But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot, so he pulled his pajama bottoms down, and then I tripped, and, fell down, and my mouth landed right on his penis, and, then I thought of something funny, so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up, and, and then Kyle took the picture from me, and he's gonna show it to everybody, and make them think I'm gaaaaaaay. [turns his face to the wall and cries again]"
409,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay. These things happen."
410,11,2,Eric Cartman,"[looks at her and sobs] But, Mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to meee. [turns to her and cries into her chest]"
411,11,2,Liane Cartman,"It's okay, Eric. I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother."
412,11,2,Eric Cartman,"You, you will?"
413,11,2,Butters Stotch,...but that He loved us and sent His Only Son to be the satisfaction of our sins. Neato!
414,11,2,Bradley,"Butters, I'm sorry for getting you into trouble."
415,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Awww, that's okay, Bradley."
416,11,2,Bradley,"I really want to get better. I try to do everything the counselors say, but some...how I still feel confused."
417,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, well hopefully, when we finish writin' all these verses, we won't be bi-curious no more, and then we can go home!"
418,11,2,Bradley,"You're really terrific, Butters. I mean, I think you're great. [warm thoughts... Bradley panics and leaves his chair] Uh oh! Oh God! Bad thought! Bad thought!"
419,11,2,Butters Stotch,Wuh-what's the matter?
420,11,2,Bradley,"I think, I, I th-, I think I like you."
421,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Well I like you too, Bradley."
422,11,2,Bradley,You do?
423,11,2,Butters Stotch,Well yeah!
424,11,2,Bradley,You like like me?
425,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Sure, I like like you a lot lot. [laughs]"
426,11,2,Bradley,"Oh God, we're both un-fixable! Don't you see we're lost causes?! We're just evil and nothing can change us! There's no other way out, Butters! We have to kill ourselves! [runs to the door and opens it, then runs out and away]"
427,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[gives chase, but isn't fast enough] No! Bradley! You can't leave; you're my accountabilibuddy!"
428,11,2,Sheila Broflovski,Hello?
429,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Hello, Sheila? It's Liane, Eric's mother."
430,11,2,Sheila Broflovski,"Ohh, hello, Mrs. Cartman."
431,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Um, Sheila, I'm sorry to trouble you with this, but apparently your son has a picture of Eric with another boy's penis in his mouth."
432,11,2,Sheila Broflovski,[long pause] Excuse me?
433,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Don't worry, sweetie, everything is fine."
434,11,2,Eric Cartman,It is? [happily jumps off his chair and runs to her] Really? Oh Mommy thank you! Thank you! [hugs her]
435,11,2,Liane Cartman,You have nothing to worry about in school tomorrow. Mrs. Broflovski assured me that Kyle doesn't have the picture.
436,11,2,Eric Cartman,[his smile vanishes] What?
437,11,2,Liane Cartman,She talked with her son and says he doesn't have it.
438,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Mom, she's lying!"
439,11,2,Liane Cartman,"She said she was sure, Eric."
440,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Mom, you don't know anything about Jews! They lie all the time!"
441,11,2,Liane Cartman,"Well, Eric, there's nothing more I can do about it."
442,11,2,Eric Cartman,[thinks a moment] Then that's it. Kyle wins. But he won't win completely! I'm going to print out another copy of that picture and show it to the class myself! I can at least rob Kyle of his final laugh.
443,11,2,Director,Do you mind telling me how you managed to lose... your accountabilibuddy?!
444,11,2,Butters Stotch,"I went looking for 'im, but he runs real fast."
445,11,2,Director,"You don't seem to take this camp seriously, Butters. I've called your father in for a talk."
446,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh no, my Dad?"
447,11,2,Director,"Do you understand the concept of Hell? Do you realize that if we don't fix you, you will burn in a lake of fire for eternity?"
448,11,2,Butters Stotch,"Well yeah, but I just don't quite understand what you're fixin'."
449,11,2,Director,We're fixing your confusion!
450,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"There you are, Butters!"
451,11,2,Director,Oheh- hey Dad.
452,11,2,Stephen Stotch,What's he done now?!
453,11,2,Director,"Mr. Stotch, your son is insubordinate, unwilling to change, and worse yet, he's lost his accountabilibuddy!"
454,11,2,A counselor,"They found him! They found Bradley! You'd better come quick! [Butters runs out, followed by Stephen, then the counselor, then the director]"
455,11,2,Director,"Oh Lord in Heaven! Don't jump, Bradley!"
456,11,2,Bradley,Stay-stay back! I'm an abomination of God!
457,11,2,Director,"No no, we're fixing you!"
458,11,2,Eric Cartman,"Guess you think today is your big day, huh Kyle? To embarrass me in front of everyone? [Kyle turns around and Cartman is in his face. Cartman softly says] Well guess what? I'm not giving you the satisfaction!"
459,11,2,Mrs Garrison,"Okay students, let's all take our seats. Since it is Monday, we'll start as always with Show And Tell. [writes the words on the board] Who'd like to go first? [Cartman holds down Kyles arm while raising his own and grunts]"
460,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Ow! Quit it, dude!"
461,11,2,Mrs Garrison,"Okay Eric, Jesus, calm down. You can go first."
462,11,2,Eric Cartman,"HA! [gets up and goes to the board, pulls down the projector screen and clears his throat.] For Show And Tell today, I would like to share with you some very special, very artsy photographs I've taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer. [clicks the projector on, and the class lights dim] This first picture I like to call ""Moods of Winter"" [a shot of snow-covered barren trees], a simple aspen grove shot in high-contrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one... of death. This picture I took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work. A statement about... all of our loneliness, perhaps?"
463,11,2,Kyle Broflovski,[to Stan] He isn't actually going to show everyone...
464,11,2,Eric Cartman,And now this next picture [clears his throat. Quick cut to]
465,11,2,Director,"Don't jump, Bradley! You will only make god angrier with you!"
466,11,2,Bradley,It's too late.
467,11,2,Butters Stotch,"[approaches the bridge] Bradley, please. You're my accountabilibuddy. How will this make me look?"
468,11,2,Director,You get back. You're only gonna make things worse.
469,11,2,Bradley,I'm not normal. I'll never be normal!
470,11,2,Butters Stotch,"You're perfectly normal, Bradley."
471,11,2,Director,Get back! You're just as confused as he is!
472,11,2,Butters Stotch,[gets angry] All right. All right that does it! [turns around and faces the crowd] I am sick and tired of everyone telling me I'm confused! I wasn't confused until other people started tellin' me I was! [Bradley listens] You know what I think? I think maybe you are the ones who are confused!
473,11,2,Bradley,Yeah.
474,11,2,Butters Stotch,"I'm not gonna be confused anymore just because you say I should be! My name is Butters, I'm eight years old, I'm blood type O, and I'm bi-curious! And even that's okay! Because if I'm bi-curious, and I'm somehow made from God, then I think your God must be a little bi-curious himself! [Bradley thinks about this]"
475,11,2,Bradley,I think. I think I'd like to come down now.
476,11,2,Director,He's coming down! [everyone begins to chatter] We did it! [stops by Bradley as Bradley climbs back onto the bridge's road] Through the power of Christ we have saved this child!
477,11,2,Stephen Stotch,"Well Butters, I guess we might as well go home. Looks like you're never gonna change."
478,11,2,Butters Stotch,No. I like bein' bi-curious.
479,11,2,Stephen Stotch,Well you know somethin'? So do I. [they both have a good laugh about it]
480,11,2,Butters Stotch,Wait. Now I am confused.
481,11,2,Eric Cartman,And this photograph I took of a sunset near the power plant. Note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the Earth. Which brings us to my last picture. Ahem. This picture you may find somewhat... controversial. [everyone gasps]
482,11,2,Bebe Stevens,Eww!
483,11,2,Clyde Donovan,[long pause] Dude.
484,11,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. This is shot at a 5.6 aperture using a low-light filter. You can see the grain from the high-speed film - there's sort of a- penis in my mouth right here - and the low depth of field keeps the background soft.
485,11,2,Mrs Garrison,"Eric, what the hell is this?!"
486,11,2,Eric Cartman,"What this is, is a statement against the war in Iraq. It's wrong that we still have our troops there. It's wrong! And what I think that-"
487,11,2,Mr Mackey,"[at the door] Uh, Eric Cartman? We got an emergency message from your mother? [reads the message] ""Do not show picture. Kyle didn't have it after all. Found it under your desk."" She said you'd know what that means, m'kay? [walks away. Cartman stands there looking at the door, then at the class. Kyle has a look of pity for Cartman on his face and blinks]"
488,11,2,Eric Cartman,[longer pause] ...Lame.
489,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"All right, students, let's take our seats. Apparently we have a little problem here at the school which we need to talk about."
490,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Ah yes. You mean the Jew problem. [points to Kyle, but blocks Kyle's view of his left hand with his right.] Good, good! I'm glad we're finally gonna do something about it."
491,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"No, I mean the problem of head lice. [a shot of the class] There's been a lice breakout at a school in Denver, and we need to make sure nobody spreads it here."
492,11,3,Bebe Stevens,Somebody might have lice?
493,11,3,Class,Ewww!
494,11,3,Mrs Garrison,So today you're all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined.
495,11,3,Eric Cartman,Uh th-that is completely unnecessary. Everyone knows that only poor people can get lice. The only person that can spread it here is Kenny.
496,11,3,Kenny McCormick,(What? Fuck you!)
497,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"I'm sure this class is clean, but we're gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice, we can stop it before it spreads. [the camera zooms in on Clyde, then on his hair...] Lice can live in anybody's hair. [...until the hair resembles a forest, with tiny houses built upon the individual hairs and a colony of lice walking around on the scalp below.]"
498,11,3,Male Louse,"[approaching a female louse with a growing louse egg resting in a nest built on a shaft] Hello, Kelly. How's my babih?"
499,11,3,Kelly,[sassily] You mean me or the little one?
500,11,3,Male Louse,I mean both.
501,11,3,Kelly,"Well, besides a little loneliness waiting for Daddy to come home, I guess we're both okay."
502,11,3,Male Louse,[holds onto one of the female's pincers] How did a louse like me get so lucky to have a louse like you?
503,11,3,Kelly,"Luck had nothing to do with it, Travis. [a group of lice tug on a hair nearby and pull it down. Travis and Kelly look on. He lets go and walks towards the fallen hair] You okay?"
504,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Sometimes... I just worry what kind of world our babih is gonna grow up in. [turns around] I need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis. I'm worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer. [turns away and walks off]
505,11,3,Lead Screener,"All students, make sure you're in line according to your grade. When you reach the front of the line you will go behind the curtain and remove any hats to be checked. [The first students go behind the curtains. Craig takes off his hat and does the same]"
506,11,3,Butters Stotch,"Boy, I sure hope they don't find lice in my hair."
507,11,3,Stan Marsh,[looks to Kyle] What do you think happens if you do have it?
508,11,3,Eric Cartman,"[answering] They drag you out of here, put you in this big containment facility, where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly, and then they shock your balls. [Butters gasps]"
509,11,3,Craig Tucker,[leaves the curtain and puts on his hat] I'm clean! I knew I didn't have any stupid lice! [walks past the rest of the class]
510,11,3,Eric Cartman,This is ridiculous. All this just so they can send Kenny and his stupid head lice home.
511,11,3,Kenny McCormick,(Hey! Fuck off!) [The screener waves Clyde forward and Clyde steps behind the curtain]
512,11,3,Lead Screener,Have a seat on the stool. [Clyde goes to the stool]
513,11,3,Lead Screener,"Uh oh, looks like you've got 'em."
514,11,3,Clyde Donovan,What?
515,11,3,Lead Screener,"You have lice. Let's see... Clyde Harris, is it?"
516,11,3,Clyde Donovan,Oh my God. Oh Christ no!
517,11,3,Lead Screener,"[writes a note and gives it to him] Now now, it's all right. We're going to call your parents and get you to your doctor."
518,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Please, ya-you don't understand. The other kids are gonna make fun of me forever!"
519,11,3,Lead Screener,I'm sure your friends aren't that cruel.
520,11,3,Clyde Donovan,Yes they are!
521,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","[approaching the group] Mr. President! Mr. President! I believe we have a serious problem! [the other lice look at him] The environment... is changing. I believe it is somehow, reacting to our presence on it."
522,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",And what do you base this on?
523,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","[walks up to a hair and draws a human head on it] Look, this is the world, right? But now, think of the world as... a living being. [the other lice look surprised] If it were somehow conscious, then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it."
524,11,3,Older Louse,"Huh right, the world is conscious. It makes perfect sense. [kneels and knocks on the scalp several times] Hello. Anybody? [the other lice begin to laugh.]"
525,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","If we have made too much of an impact, then that consciousness would try to snuff us out! I think we're looking at a global catastrophe, the likes of which we've never seen!"
526,11,3,Older Louse,Poodiggery and poppycock!
527,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","I think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation, perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation."
528,11,3,Older Louse,Evacuation?! Tomorrow is the Gootack Festival. Do you know how much money we would lose? Escort Mr. Mayfield out. The President can't be bothered any further.
529,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[as security escorts him away] Damn you Vice President Craig! You could be killin' us all!
530,11,3,Clyde Donovan,This is so... embarrassing.
531,11,3,Girl,I have an ear infection. What are you seeing the doctor for?
532,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"I have... I have AIDS. [his mother looks at him, astonished]"
533,11,3,Nurse,Clyde Harris? [Clyde goes in to see the doctor.]
534,11,3,Doctor,"[writing out a prescription] Yeeaahh, that's a pretty bad lice problem there. Good thing they pulled you out of school."
535,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"[desperate] But why me, doctor? Why me?! How did I get this?!"
536,11,3,Doctor,"[walks up to Clyde] Well, believe it or not, some lice can actually attach themselves to flies, and then wait for the fly to land on someone's head where they can reproduce. And then the lice that live in your head now were probably all born there."
537,11,3,Clyde Donovan,...Sick!
538,11,3,Doctor,"This shampoo should take care of it. [hands him a bottle] Use this in the shower. Your scalp may burn a bit afterwards, but... it should kill... every last one of them."
539,11,3,Kelly,Travis? Everything okay?
540,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Kelly, I was just thinkin' about our babih. I want to name her... Hope."
541,11,3,Kelly,Hope?
542,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Hope for a... chance at tomorrow? [water begins to drop down from on high]
543,11,3,Louse 1,It's raining? Now? [Other lice stop and notice. Turns out Clyde is taking a shower.]
544,11,3,Louse 2,[starts dancing] Woohoo! I love the rain! [other lice join in the play. Travis doesn't have a good feeling about this]
545,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Oh my God. [runs to Kelly and their egg] We have to get out of here!
546,11,3,Kelly,"What it, it's just rain."
547,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","We have to get out of here now, Kellih! [grabs the egg and runs off with Kelly. Other lice continue dancing in the rain while still others watch. One or two look around and notice a green liquid spreading over the scalp.]"
548,11,3,Louse 3,"What is that? [walks up to the leading edge, reaches down and grabs a gob of it. The liquid quickly eats through his pincer and he screams in pain. The leading edge of the liquid moves past him and leaves him trapped in the liquid, which eats at him some more]"
549,11,3,Lice,"Whoa! [the liquid finally finishes him off. The other lice see the leading edge of the liquid get closer to them, and they run] Ruuun! [some of them get overtaken by the liquid, which is now moving quickly over the scalp. The camera follows them until it finds Travis]"
550,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Everyone get up into the trees! We have to get up high! Come on, Kelly! [the lice that can, climb up the hairs while the others get swept up by the RID-X and killed]"
551,11,3,Kelly,"My God, Travis, they're all dying!"
552,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Don't look, Kelly! Don't look!"
553,11,3,Louse 4,What the hell is it?!
554,11,3,Louse 5,"Well it's okay, we're safe up here! [the hairs begin to sway back and forth as a strong wind begins to blow]"
555,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",I don't think so! [lice begin to be pushed off the hairs]
556,11,3,Louse 4,[blown away] OoOhOOOoooh!
557,11,3,Kelly,Travis!
558,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Kellih! Hang on!
559,11,3,Kelly,I can't... hang on!
560,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","You have to! For the babih! [Kelly's grip loosens. She tightens it, but the wind rips her from the pincer she was holding on with]"
561,11,3,Kelly,Nooooooooooo!
562,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Kehhhllihhhh! No! Noooo! [he's left alone on the hair with the egg, Hope]"
563,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, kids, today we're going to review some Civil War history. Who can tell me what year the war started?"
564,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Waiwaiwait, whoa whoa, so what happened?"
565,11,3,Mrs Garrison,With what?
566,11,3,Craig Tucker,"With the lice exam. Did they find anybody with lice? [Clyde looks apprehensive, and Mrs. Garrison notices]"
567,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"Y-yes, some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken."
568,11,3,Stan Marsh,Somebody in this class?
569,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"Uh, yes."
570,11,3,Class,Ohhhhh.
571,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Well who was it? [points to Kenny] It was Kenny, right?"
572,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"That doesn't matter, it's over."
573,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Doesn't matter?! If somebody had parasites in their hair, we need to know who! [points to Kenny again] It was Kenny, wasn't it?"
574,11,3,Red,"I wanna know who it was, too."
575,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"It's being kept confidential! There's a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice, because of the embarrassment it can cause, okay?!"
576,11,3,Eric Cartman,[pounds on his desk] That is bullcrap! You are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast!
577,11,3,Class,Yeah!
578,11,3,Bebe Stevens,And we have a right to know which boy had lice in his hair so we don't ever go out with them!
579,11,3,Craig Tucker,How do we know it was a boy? It could just have easily been one of you stupid girls!
580,11,3,Butters Stotch,Yeah! Dumb girls!
581,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"The case is closed! Whoever had the lice, they're dead now! We're moving on to Civil War history. [the camera zooms in on Clyde again] Ulysses S. Grant-"
582,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Hope. Hope, you're alive. [he stands up to his full height and surveys the destruction all around him] My God... [a decomposed louse stands up and collapses on him] Heh?!"
583,11,3,Louse 6,Help me... Help meeee... [it falls away and dies]
584,11,3,Louse 7,"Travis. [Travis looks to his right] Over here! Travis, if you hadn't warned us to get up in them trees, we'd all be dead."
585,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",How many survivors?
586,11,3,Louse 7,Just the six of us. And the Vice President.
587,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","[notices and throws the Vice President up against a hair] You son of a bitch! You had a chance to stop this! So help me, if we live through this, I'm gonna see you rot in prison!"
588,11,3,Louse 8,What do we do now?
589,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[turns and faces the others] We aren't out of this yet! You two look for other survivors. You get whatever food you can and bring it back here. [the lice do as commanded]
590,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[the older louse] Who put you in charge?!
591,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[turns around] God did! When he killed my wife! [turns back and walks away]
592,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now, so that we know to stay away from you! [Opposite Cartman are Jimmy, Tweek, Clyde, Anne, Bebe, Red. and two other kids. With Cartman are Craig, Token, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Kevin, Butters, and Wendy]"
593,11,3,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, come on! We're gonna find out sooner or later."
594,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Okay, whoever you are, you are now not only a licehead, you're a liar! You're only making this worse on yourself!"
595,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,You know what? I'll bet it was you!
596,11,3,Eric Cartman,Me?!
597,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,This is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair! Try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself!
598,11,3,Eric Cartman,"I don't think so, Kyle! But you know what?! This is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice! Try to get everyone to blame me!"
599,11,3,Stan Marsh,You guys stop it! This isn't getting us anywhere!
600,11,3,Eric Cartman,"That's exactly what you would do if you had had head lice, Stan. [Stan is stunned]"
601,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, try to have everyone make peace so it doesn't seem like a big deal."
602,11,3,Eric Cartman,And this is exactly what Kenny would do: stand here and say nothing! [Kenny makes an angry face]
603,11,3,Butters Stotch,"[sensing where this is going] Heh hey guys, what would I do?"
604,11,3,Bebe Stevens,Let's just get a magnifying glass and look at everyone's heads.
605,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,It's too late. The treatment would have killed it all.
606,11,3,Clyde Donovan,Well I guess we're never gonna know. There's no way to tell.
607,11,3,Eric Cartman,There's a way! There's a way to find out who had sick-ass head cooties! And I'm gonna find it! [turns left and walks away. Clyde looks around]
608,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,It was him. It had to have been him!
609,11,3,Stan Marsh,Yeah... Or you. [they check out each other]
610,11,3,Louse 9,"Mark? Mark, you have to hang on."
611,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","This isn't going to stop. The world is rejecting us! If we're gonna live, we have to get off this planet."
612,11,3,Louse 8,How?
613,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","First we have to get out of the forest, into the forbidden zone. It's the only way we might even see another planet!"
614,11,3,Louse 9,The forbidden zone... We'll be exposed. We'll die out there.
615,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","We'll die here! Look, the world is getting rid of us! Don't you get it?!"
616,11,3,Louse 1,Getting rid of us? You-you mean like it knows what it's doing?
617,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Yes! Because maybe we rolled the dice too many times!
618,11,3,Louse 9,I'm not leaving my husband.
619,11,3,Louse 11,Yeah huh-I'll take my chances here.
620,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",You can all stay here; I'm gonna try to save my babih. [turns around and walks away]
621,11,3,Louse 12,"[redhead, runs up to him] I'll go with you. There's nothing left for me here."
622,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",I wanna go too.
623,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Not a chance.
624,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Look, I know I messed up, all right? But I think you're right. If we can get out of the forest, we might find another place to live."
625,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","If we find anything, we'll try to send help for the rest of you. [to the redhead and the Vice President] Let's go. [the redhead moves] Come on if you're comin' Mister Vice President! [turns left and follows the redhead]"
626,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[tarries] Yeah. Right behind you. [pulls out a gun and cocks it]
627,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, lock that door, Craig! [Craig goes to lock the door]"
628,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"What's this about, Cartman? [the boys are now seated on a bench against a wall]"
629,11,3,Eric Cartman,"I've come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice. [whips out a little propane torch from his right pocket] We're gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties. [whips out a lighter from his left pocket, strikes the lighter on, and uses the lighter to light the torch. He puts the lighter away. Clyde is scared now.] Lice feed on a person's blood, and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the host's bloodstream. That saliva, is monochromagnic. So if an infected person's blood is touched by... this hot metal coil, say... that person's blood will jump 10 meters into the air."
630,11,3,Jimmy Valmer,Ur ur re- ur really?
631,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"That's retarded! You didn't come up with that experiment, Cartman, you saw it in that movie, The Thing!"
632,11,3,Eric Cartman,"[figuring out how to respond] This is a scientific test, designed to-"
633,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,You saw it in The Thing and you're wasting everyone's time!
634,11,3,Eric Cartman,"I thought you might say that, Kyle. Because you don't want to take the test, do you?!"
635,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody's blood is going to jump up in the air!
636,11,3,Eric Cartman,"If it isn't going to work, then what are you afraid of? The only person who wouldn't want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice!"
637,11,3,Craig Tucker,Yeah. That's true.
638,11,3,Jimmy Valmer,I have no problem taking the test. I have nothing to hi-huhiii-hide
639,11,3,Token Black,Yeah. Me neither.
640,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine. I'll do the dumb test."
641,11,3,Eric Cartman,Everyone take a Petri dish and a syringe. We need at least 30 cc's of blood from each one of you.
642,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, now everyone back over there! [the boys head back to the bench] We'll start with what I already know. [moves the heated coil tip over the blood sample. Only steam comes from it]"
643,11,3,Butters Stotch,"Well, guess that proves Eric wasn't the one with head lice."
644,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,It doesn't prove anything!
645,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Yeah? Let's just see what your blood does, Kyle! [takes Kyle's Petri dish and ...the same thing happens] Huh, I guess you're clean. [tries another Petri dish]"
646,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Ye-you guys, we'd better go. Recess is almost over."
647,11,3,Eric Cartman,"It's all right, it won't take much longer, just-AHH AHHGH! [sticks the tip into the Petri dish, causing the blood to heat up and jump out of the dish. He gets the blood all over himself, and for good measure, tosses the rest of the blood onto himself.]"
648,11,3,Token Black,What the hell?! [Clyde is scared shitless. Cartman turns the dish around to reveal the name: Kenny]
649,11,3,Eric Cartman,Kenny!
650,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,No way.
651,11,3,Craig Tucker,"You were right all along, Eric. It was Kenny."
652,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Of course I was right! I told you only poor people get lice! [silence for a second or two, then Kenny bolts for the door, pushing Craig aside, opening the door, and running down the hall]"
653,11,3,Louse 12,"We've done it. We've reached the forbidden zone. [a vast space of... nothing, like a desert] I've always heard stories about this place. Never thought it was real."
654,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",It's real. Real as my love for my unborn babih.
655,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","So what exactly is your plan, Travis?"
656,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Our ancestors came here from another world. Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us. Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.
657,11,3,Louse 12,"Travis. Travis, you're, so wise, so strong. If we make it out of this, I'd like to... be with you."
658,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Sorry, babe, but my heart is forever stenciled in permanent ink with the name [closes his eyes] Kelly."
659,11,3,Louse 12,She was a lucky woman to have you.
660,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Luck had nothin' to do with it. [a gunshot from behind kills the redhead, who wobbles forward, then back and to the ground. The Vice President keeps his gun trained on her corpse]"
661,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",[aims his gun at Travis] Sorry to cut the honeymoon short!
662,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Why you murdering bastard!
663,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Your little fantasy of another world ends here! Walk!
664,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","What the hell do you want, Vice President?!"
665,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Walk! [Travis turns and walks, and the Vice President follows him, keeping the gun trained on him.]"
666,11,3,Craig Tucker,"Clyde, dude, get down to the park. We caught Kenny, and we're all gonna let him have it! [points to the sock in his right hand]"
667,11,3,Clyde Donovan,What? What are you gonna do to him?
668,11,3,Eric Cartman,"He lied to us all! He betrayed his kind! We all know what has to happen. [beat] Grab a sock and a bar of soap, and meet us at the park! [they turn and head off]"
669,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"[his eyes wander as he thinks] You guys, wait. [the guys turn around]"
670,11,3,Eric Cartman,"What, Clyde?"
671,11,3,Clyde Donovan,I... nothing.
672,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, see you there! [the guys turn around and leave] Remember, bar of soap and a sock! Kenny's gonna get it!"
673,11,3,Token Black,Yeah!
674,11,3,Craig Tucker,Yeah!
675,11,3,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah! We're gonna fu-fu-fuck him up! [Clyde sees them leave, then backs up, scared]"
676,11,3,Mrs Garrison,Yello?
677,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Mrs. Garrison, one of your students is about to be attacked at the park by all the other students."
678,11,3,Mrs Garrison,What? Who's going to get attacked? Who is this?!
679,11,3,Clyde Donovan,Please just hurry to the park! You have to stop them!
680,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",That's good! That's far enough! [Travis stops and turns]
681,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",What are you going to do?
682,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","I'm gonna go back to the village, start to rebuild, mate with the females, become... President!"
683,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Don't you get it? The world doesn't want you here! It's not gonna stop until you're dead!
684,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",It was a disaster! Disasters happen!
685,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Then go ahead and die there, I'm leavin' with my babih!"
686,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Actually, you're never leaving here either, Travis! [shoots out the knees of Travis's hind legs]"
687,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",Damn you! Why?!
688,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Because when I'm President, I can't have pests like you constantly trying to preach that the world is alive! You're an idealistic fool! The world is not ""conscious,"" we are conscious! If the world was alive, it would feel this! [plugs six bullets into Clyde's scalp]"
689,11,3,Clyde Donovan,[feeling the little stings] Ow. [reaches back to the base of his skull]
690,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President",You die he- [looks up. Two fingers reach down and grab him. He screams like he's never screamed before as Travis watches the fingers take him away.]
691,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Kenny McCormick, you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school, and lying about it to cover your ass! How do you plead?!"
692,11,3,Kenny McCormick,[restrained by Kevin and Bradley] (Not guilty!)
693,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Guilty! I thought so! [the boys pull down his hood and coat, and his shirt]"
694,11,3,Craig Tucker,"All right, let's do this!"
695,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"You guys, maybe we should just... wait a few more minutes?"
696,11,3,Eric Cartman,"All right, Kenny. You know what has to happen! Sock bath! Everyone wash Kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks! [the boys gang up on Kenny and give him the sock bath]"
697,11,3,Kenny McCormick,"Nohoho! No, not the socks! Ahhhgh, stop!"
698,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Wait, wait!"
699,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait... stop it, stop it! [he walks away; the others stop and look at him] I can't let Kenny be sock-dried."
700,11,3,Craig Tucker,He had cooties and he lied about it!
701,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks over his left shoulder] Kenny didn't have the head lice, all right?! [looks away] It was me."
702,11,3,Clyde Donovan,What?
703,11,3,Kyle Broflovski,"I was the one. I was too afraid to say anything, but I can't let Kenny be sock-bathed for it."
704,11,3,Stan Marsh,"Why are you saying that, Kyle? You can't be the one who had head lice. [walks up to him] Because I was. You're just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out, didn't you?!"
705,11,3,Clyde Donovan,"Wait a-wait a minute, what?"
706,11,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh I get it. [walks up to Stan and Kyle] This is some kind of big trick on me! You've known I was the one with head lice all along, huh?!"
707,11,3,Stan Marsh,You had head lice?
708,11,3,Eric Cartman,Of course! Why do you think I went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame Kenny?!
709,11,3,Mrs Garrison,"[offscreen] You all had head lice! [the boys look up and off to the left. Mrs. Garrison walks up to them on the court] Every single person in the class! The boys aaand the girls! Lice spreads fast, you dumb-asses!"
710,11,3,Craig Tucker,I thought I was the only one.
711,11,3,Butters Stotch,Me too.
712,11,3,Eric Cartman,"But that means... that means Kenny was lying! Sock bath! [the other boys join in the chant ""Sock bath!"" and gang up on Kenny once again]"
713,11,3,Kenny McCormick,Dudes!
714,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Kellih. Kellih, can you hear mih? I don't know if you can. But... I wanted you to know I tried. I tried to save our babih. But I let you down, babe. [blinks. A light shines on him and a vision of Kelly descends. Travis holds his left hand up as a visor to make sure he's not hallucinating] Keh... k-Kellih? [Kelly's apparition disappears, replaced by a fly. Travis climbs on to one of the fly's legs, and the fly takes off. After a long while, the fly alights on a new host and Travis drops to the ground, asleep. Members of a darker, buffer species of louse watch from the shadows. They prop him up and carry him away]"
715,11,3,Louse 13,"You are welcome here. [the colony here is well-developed, with entrances to dwellings going up several stories, making the hairs act as high-rise apartments. The residents there wave as he passes by] You're safe now. We've lived here for generation after generation, never being disturbed."
716,11,3,"Lice, including Travis Mayfield, Kelly, President, Vice President","Heh. We made it, Hope. We made it, Kellih! [at this point the camera pulls back, out of the hair, and out of the space between a pair of female legs. The camera pulls back enough to show an actress exiting her limousine.]"
717,11,3,Agent,"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Angelina Jolie! [photographers start snapping away with their cameras]"
718,11,3,Angelina Jolie,Hello everyone! [scratches her groin through her dress] Hello!
719,11,4,Mrs Garrison,"All right, students, let's take our seats. Everyone try to be nice because we have a new student joining us today, and I know you'll all make him feel welcome. Say hello to... Baahir Hassan Abdul Hakeem."
720,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh! [Kyle's seat is empty, and he fears the worst]"
721,11,4,Mrs Garrison,"Welcome to our class, Baahir."
722,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",Thank you.
723,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Duhude, dude, [throws out his arms, palms out] not cool!"
724,11,4,Mrs Garrison,Why don't you take a seat in Kyle's empty desk for now?
725,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems","Okay. [goes to Kyle's seat. Cartman begins crawling out of his, away from Baahir]"
726,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Oooh hooohoho. Nooo, noohoohoo."
727,11,4,Mrs Garrison,"[stopping him. What follows is in hushed tones] Eric, what the hell is wrong with you?!"
728,11,4,Eric Cartman,"What's wrong? [looks at Baahir, who's looking back at him, then looks back at Mrs. Garrison and takes her aside] Has he been checked for bombs?"
729,11,4,Mrs Garrison,"Eric, that's enough! Not all Muslim people are terrorists!"
730,11,4,Eric Cartman,"No, but most of them are. And all it takes is most of them."
731,11,4,Butters Stotch,"[slides down gleefully] Now you go, Baahir. [Baahir climbs the ladder steps and slides down. Butters cheers him on. Cartman shows up and looks at them. Baahir dusts himself off. Cartman turns and walks away, then places a call on his cell phone]"
732,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,[sniffs - he has a stuffy nose] Yeah?
733,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[hushed] Kyle, are you on your computer?"
734,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What? No, I'm sick. [sniffs]"
735,11,4,Eric Cartman,Get online. I need you to check something for me.
736,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, leave me alone."
737,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, every one of our friends might be in serious danger!"
738,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,[sits right up] What? Why?
739,11,4,Eric Cartman,Get online now!
740,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, all right. [leaves his bed and goes to his computer, sits down and starts clicking]"
741,11,4,Eric Cartman,Go to MySpace. [enters the school building] See if there's a MySpace page for a Baahir Hakeem.
742,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[types a search term at MySpace] Baahir Hakeem. [Baahir's page pops up] Born in Chicago, eight years old, his favorite color is green... Car, Cartman, what is this all about?"
743,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[begins walking down the hallway] Kyle, I want you to check his buddy list. How many MySpace friends does he have?"
744,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Over a hundred.
745,11,4,Eric Cartman,[walks further along] Look further down the page. Does he list his favorite band?
746,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,White Stripes
747,11,4,Eric Cartman,[stops suddenly] That's funny.
748,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?
749,11,4,Eric Cartman,He told everyone in class today his favorite band was Blink 182.
750,11,4,Eric Cartman,[voiceover] The following takes place between Recess and Geography class.
751,11,4,Officer Barbrady,Hello?
752,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[entering the boys' restroom, still in hushed tones] Officer Barbrady, South Park Elementary is in serious danger! [checks the toilet stalls on all fours]"
753,11,4,Officer Barbrady,From what? Who is this?
754,11,4,Eric Cartman,I've just ID'd a Muslim and his MySpace page does not check out. You've got to get these people out of here now!
755,11,4,Officer Barbrady,Are you serious?
756,11,4,Eric Cartman,"If I wasn't serious, would I be talking like this?"
757,11,4,Officer Barbrady,Like what?
758,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Whispering, but whispering really loudly for dramatic effect."
759,11,4,Officer Barbrady,Oh jeez.
760,11,4,Mrs Garrison,What the hell?
761,11,4,Principal Victoria,[over the PA system] All students are to evacuate the school immediately! [Baahir looks around]
762,11,4,Butters Stotch,"Hey, Baahir, uh since we get to go home, you wanna come over uh, play checkers?"
763,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems","Sure, okay. [12:02:32 pops up on screen and ticks the seconds away.]"
764,11,4,Butters Stotch,Well all right! [they walk off together]
765,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude. [sniffs and calls Cartman. The LED readout vanishes]
766,11,4,Eric Cartman,[exits the building through a side door and answers the call] Yeah. [walks among various trash cans and bins]
767,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I just got an IM from Stan that they evacuated the school."
768,11,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Now do you believe me that somethin' is goin' on?!
769,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,I guess so.
770,11,4,Eric Cartman,Yeah well I don't like it! It doesn't follow!
771,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Wuh what doesn't follow?
772,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Why would a terrorist just blow up a school? It's not their M.O. Unless... Oh my God! Unless this was all just a big diversion. [starts running] Kyle, I need you to Google-search the South Park Chamber of Commerce!"
773,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Okay.
774,11,4,Eric Cartman,Their Web site should have a calendar of events: is there anything big going on in town today?!
775,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks up the info as Cartman talks] Yeah. Actually, there is."
776,11,4,Eric Cartman,[stops] What?
777,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,There's a Hillary Clinton campaign rally. [Cartman stays silent] Cartman? ...Cartman? [Cartman has turned off his phone and runs out of school]
778,11,4,Head Agent,Sir! There's somebody calling in saying there's going to be a terrorist attack on the Hillary Clinton rally today.
779,11,4,Head Agent,"What? [takes the call] This is CIA head, Alan Thompson."
780,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Thompson, you have to call off the Clinton rally! There's a terrorist in South Park!"
781,11,4,Mr Thompson,What do you know?
782,11,4,Eric Cartman,He just showed up out of the blue! I need to speak with the President right away!
783,11,4,Mr Thompson,I'm the head of the CIA! You can tell me!
784,11,4,Eric Cartman,I said I will only talk to the President!
785,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Look, if you have information of a threat, you could-"
786,11,4,Eric Cartman,LALALALALALALALA!
787,11,4,Mr Thompson,I will have you arrested for-!
788,11,4,Eric Cartman,LALALA-I can't hear you! Only the President! LALALALALALA!
789,11,4,Aide,"Call is coming through now, Mr. President."
790,11,4,George W. Bush,Hello?
791,11,4,Eric Cartman,"President Bush, this is Eric Cartman! Are we on a secure line?"
792,11,4,George W. Bush,Huh? Who.
793,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Look, I know you're not the biggest Hildog fan, but she is in great danger right now!"
794,11,4,George W. Bush,Hildog?
795,11,4,Aide,"Yes, I understand. I'll let Ms. Clinton know."
796,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"What is it, Brian?"
797,11,4,Brian,"Ms. Clinton, we just received word of a possible terrorist attack on your rally today."
798,11,4,Hillary Clinton,Is the thread credible?
799,11,4,Brian,"We aren't sure, but... perhaps it's best we call it off. [behind him, the rally gets closer and closer]"
800,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"No. No, I will not be bullied by terrorist threats. Your men do a good job, Brian. I have faith that any thread will be taken care of accordingly."
801,11,4,Driver,"We've reached the rally site, Hildog."
802,11,4,Aide 2,"Don't worry, Mrs. Clinton, I'm sure everything will be fine."
803,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"Thank you, Chris. [leaves with Brian and a third aide. The driver walks off in the opposite direction, and Chris whips out a cell phone. He walks forward and calls someone]"
804,11,4,Chris,They know about the bomb!
805,11,4,Blond Russian,That is impossible! We took every measure to assure the bomb was hidden from sight.
806,11,4,Chris,"Well somebody tipped off the CIA. I don't know how much they know, but security has been heightened."
807,11,4,Blond Russian,That bomb must travel with the Clinton rally to Boston!
808,11,4,Chris,"The bomb won't make it to Boston now! With the heightened security, it's only a matter of time before they find it!"
809,11,4,Blonde Russian,Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.
810,11,4,Chris,"I understand, comrade."
811,11,4,Blonde Russian,Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.
812,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, I'm at the Clinton rally site, but there's no sign of that kid!"
813,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,So then maybe you're wrong.
814,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Nope, I'm not wrong. He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?"
815,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.
816,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Jesus, that's on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I'm going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?"
817,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. [Cartman giggles and sticks the phone down his pants, in front of his genitals. He takes the picture and sends it to Kyle. Kyle receives it on his computer] What is that?"
818,11,4,Eric Cartman,It's my balls! [laughs as Kyle just looks at the image]
819,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,God damn it Cartman!
820,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[his laugh dies down, then] Okay. Okay, Kyle, let's stay focused here."
821,11,4,Mayor McDaniels,"People of South Park, it is my honor to introduce a woman who deserves nothing but respect. Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton! [the crowd cheers and holds up pro-Hillary signs: ""Hildog"", ""In Hildog We Trust"", ""Hildog, we love you!"", ""Hildog #1 fan"", ""South Park Wants Hildog!!"", ""Hildog '08"", ""We Love You""]"
822,11,4,Hillary Clinton,[affecting a Southern accent] It is so nice to be back in a small town like the one I came from. [more cheers for her]
823,11,4,Hildog Fan,Here we go! [his friends don dog-headed helmets and start barking.]
824,11,4,Brian,"Otis Green, anything on that bomb threat? [""You know, when I start my life in office, quite a few changes have to be made!""]"
825,11,4,Otis,"We have the bomb-sniffing pig going through the crowd. If there is a bomb, the pig will find it. [the third aide has the pig on a leash, letting it roam as it will]"
826,11,4,Hillary Clinton,This is why I campaign in small towns like these! Because it is in towns like South Park that you find the true America! [more cheers go up as aide and pig move around]
827,11,4,Aide 3,"Oh my God, she got a scent! [the pig walks faster]"
828,11,4,Brian,What?!
829,11,4,Aide 3,The pig is picking up the smell of nuclear residue. Terrorists have hidden a bomb!
830,11,4,Brian,[getting nervous] Oh my God! Where?! Where could they have stashed it?!
831,11,4,Aide 3,"Come on, find it. Find! [the pig leads him up the steps to the stage]"
832,11,4,Brian,"My God, they hid it under the stage?!"
833,11,4,Female Aide,"No wait, look. [the pig approaches Hillary and really wants to get at that bomb]"
834,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"How much money do we have to waste on needless spendin' when we should be focusing all our attention on... uh... [the pig buries its snout in Hillary's ass] on the education of all- Woo haha, whoa there, girl. Haha, [puts some distance between herself and the pig, but the pig won't back off] uh, uh, on the education of all children. [the pig tries the groin this time] Oh, I declare!"
835,11,4,Otis,Oh my God. Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton's...
836,11,4,Head Agent,"Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists have obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton's... well, in her..."
837,11,4,Mr Thompson,In her what?
838,11,4,Head Agent,"In her snatch, sir."
839,11,4,Mr Thompson,What?!
840,11,4,Hillary Clinton,What is goin' on? I wasn't finished.
841,11,4,Brian,"Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing. [receives a call and answers it] Yes."
842,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch."
843,11,4,Brian,A what?!
844,11,4,Mr Thompson,A snatch. It's the technical term for vagina.
845,11,4,Brian,"No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!"
846,11,4,Mr Waters,"Mr. Jeffries, this is Frank Waters. It's a suitcase nuke, designed to fit in a woman's snizz. It's called a snuke."
847,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"What is goin' on, Brian?"
848,11,4,Brian,"Ms. Clinton, it appears that terrorists have snuck a snuke up your snizz."
849,11,4,Hillary Clinton,[fans herself in a Southern fashion] Oh my.
850,11,4,Brian,What do we do? Can we disable the timer?
851,11,4,Mr Thompson,It won't have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.
852,11,4,Brian,But then that means...
853,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Yes. If we don't find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever."
854,11,4,Mr Thompson,Do we have that phone trace?
855,11,4,CIA Vice Head,"[hands him the phone] The call is going through now, sir."
856,11,4,Eric Cartman,[gets the call] Yeah? [walks through a parking lot]
857,11,4,Mr Thompson,"This is CIA head Alan Thompson. We spoke before about the- [he and his agents walk down the street. Two angles are shown of that, and a third image of Cartman walking through the lot]"
858,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Mr. Thompson?"
859,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Well, we've just arrived in your town."
860,11,4,Eric Cartman,Why? Did you find something?
861,11,4,Mr Thompson,Yes. There's a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton's snizz.
862,11,4,Eric Cartman,[stops] A snuke?
863,11,4,Mr Thompson,That's right. It's controlled by a remote detonator. We have to locate the terrorist before he sets it off.
864,11,4,Eric Cartman,[walks again] I have the address of the house the terrorist moved into. I'm almost there now; where are you?
865,11,4,Mr Thompson,"We're on the town's main street, right by an ice cream shop."
866,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh dude, I'm, I'm right next to you. [the framing for the two scenes is removed to reveal the one image of Cartman standing next to the CIA agents. They look at each other]"
867,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Oh, hey."
868,11,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we totally got let out of school."
869,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I know. Something big is going on. Take a look at this. I did a Google search for ""Hillary Clinton Campaign Rally"" right? And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos."
870,11,4,Stan Marsh,Russian?
871,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, this guy. [a YouTube profile page is shown] Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally."
872,11,4,Stan Marsh,So he's a Hillary Clinton fan.
873,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he's an old-school Communist. So what's he doing at every Clinton rally?"
874,11,4,Stan Marsh,Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.
875,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Oh that's a good idea. [does the search]
876,11,4,Mr Hakeem,What is going on? What have we done?
877,11,4,Mr Thompson,They claim they don't know anything about an attack.
878,11,4,Eric Cartman,Big surprise!
879,11,4,Police Officer,"Sir, first pass of the house, we didn't find a snuke detonator anywhere."
880,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Mr. Hakeem, where is your son?"
881,11,4,Mr Hakeem,We thought he was at school. He's not at school?
882,11,4,Brian,"You're doing great, Ms. Clinton."
883,11,4,Hillary Clinton,"Do they know how long, Brian? How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?"
884,11,4,Brian,"They'll find the detonator, Hildog."
885,11,4,Aide 3,"We can't wait for them to find the detonator. If we can get to the bomb, me-maybe we can deactivate it. Can't somebody go and take a look inside Mrs. Clinton's snizz?"
886,11,4,EOD Leader,[part of the bomb squad] I'm not sending any of my men in there.
887,11,4,Chris,Are you almost ready to set off the bomb?
888,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Everything is set. We have the detonator up and running. [the detonator is shown with its LED readout: 12:34:10... 12:34:11... 12:34:12... 12:34:13... ]
889,11,4,Agent 2,"Mr. Hakeem, we need to know where your son is!"
890,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"I tell you, I do not know."
891,11,4,Agent 2,"[sighs, then leaves the room with the female agent and enters the adjoining control room, where Mr. Thompson is waiting] This is getting us nowhere. If he knows anything, he's not saying."
892,11,4,Eric Cartman,Let me have time with him.
893,11,4,Female Agent,What are you going to do?
894,11,4,Eric Cartman,We have to find that detonator! Let me have time with him! [removes his cap and goes in] You will tell me where your son is!
895,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"He should be at school! [Cartman walks off and brings back a stool, setting it against Mr. Hakeem's chair. He climbs up and stands on the stool, drops his pants, and starts farting.] Hey!"
896,11,4,Eric Cartman,[farts] Where is the detonator?!
897,11,4,Mr Hakeem,Wuh-what detonator are you ta-
898,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[farts some more, and again, and again] I can do this aaall day."
899,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"[coughs] I don't know anything about a- [Cartman farts a short one, and then a long one that makes Mr. Hakeem turn away] Aawwwwgh [holds his breath, gasps for air and coughs] Stop it! Really!"
900,11,4,Eric Cartman,You can make it stop!
901,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"[almost weeps] I don't have the- [Cartman farts for a long time, and the female agent turns away from the one-way window]"
902,11,4,Female Agent,Are we just gonna let this go on? [Cartman continues farting]
903,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, I got a text of the Russian guy's podcast. It's all a bunch of links to eBay."
904,11,4,Stan Marsh,You should be able to search his username on eBay and see what he's been buying and selling. [CIA agents enter the room quickly with their equipment]
905,11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Ferris, set up over there. Two of you can take that bed area. [Stan steps down for a better look at the activity]"
906,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Hey.
907,11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Donner, take over that station. [points to Kyle. Donner walks over and shoves Kyle off his chair]"
908,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,[stands up] What's going on?
909,11,4,CIA Vice Head,This apartment is being absorbed by Homeland Security!
910,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,...Homeland Security?
911,11,4,CIA Vice Head,"Look, your little game of goin' over people's heads is over! You could still work, but from now on you answer to me, you got that?!"
912,11,4,FBI Leader,"'Scuse me, who's in charge here?!"
913,11,4,CIA Vice Head,I am!
914,11,4,FBI Leader,[more people come in] Yeah well not anymore you're not. This apartment has just been assigned to the FBI.
915,11,4,CIA Vice Head,That's outrageous! On whose orders?!
916,11,4,FBI Leader,"On order of the Secretary of Defense! You had your shot, now I'm in charge!"
917,11,4,ATF Leader,"[more people come in] Not anymore you're not! Orders just came down from Central! They want ATF handling this on all fronts! All right people, from now on you're answering to me!"
918,11,4,Secret Service Leader,[more people come in] Not anymore they're not! Orders from the President: he wants this handled by his staff personally! Now Nelson is in charge.
919,11,4,Nelson,[bursts into the scene] Not anymore I'm not! [everyone else falls silent]
920,11,4,Mr Hakeem,What are you going to do to my wife?!
921,11,4,Eric Cartman,Nothing... if you tell me where your son is!
922,11,4,Mrs Hakeem,We told you: we don't know.
923,11,4,Eric Cartman,"[whips around and shows them the syringe] Do you know what this is?! [they look at each other, unsure] This... is apple juice. It gives super bad farts. [injects himself with the syringe into the right arm and hops up on the stool next to Mrs. Hakeem]"
924,11,4,Female Agent,Did he just inject himself with apple juice?
925,11,4,Eric Cartman,Where is your son?!
926,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"She doesn't know either. [Cartman turns and drops his pants, and farts on Mrs. Hakeem's face]"
927,11,4,Mrs Hakeem,Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah!
928,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"I mean it! Stop! That is disgusting! Where is your mother?! [a phone rings and the camera zooms in on Mrs. Hakeem's shirt pocket. Cartman turns and reaches into the pocket, pulling out the cell phone]"
929,11,4,Eric Cartman,Answer it! [holds the phone to Mrs. Hakeem's right ear]
930,11,4,Mrs Hakeem,Hallo? Hallo Baahir. Where are you? Who it But-ters?
931,11,4,Eric Cartman,Butters.
932,11,4,Mrs Hakeem,"Baahir, one of your classmates is keeping us hostage. [Cartman drops the phone and farts a good gust of flatulence against Mrs. Hakeem's face] Aaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! [Cartman drops off the stool and enters the control room.]"
933,11,4,Mr Hakeem,Ogh! You filthy little rapscallion!
934,11,4,Eric Cartman,We got him! I know where he is!
935,11,4,Female Agent,"All right, where? We'll send our people in."
936,11,4,Eric Cartman,"No no, he's my lead. [opens the suitcase]"
937,11,4,Mr Thompson,You're not going alone.
938,11,4,Eric Cartman,You blow in there and you risk taking him down without finding the detonator! I'm going to find out where it is! [gives himself a double injection of apple juice]
939,11,4,CIA Leader 2,"[white hair] All right, people, I'm in charge now and we will find the terrorists. Jarvis, I want you to check for any terrorist chatter on AOL. Marley and Greggs, try searching for nuclear devices on askjeeves.com."
940,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Ask Jeeves? Nobody uses Ask Jeeves! Just Google-search it!
941,11,4,CIA Leader 2,Are you tellin' me how to do my job?
942,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. There's a Russian guy named Vladimir Stolfsky who's got search engine hits all over this thing.
943,11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Chase, search the name Stolfsky on YouTube and cross-reference it with JDate!"
944,11,4,Chase,Checking.
945,11,4,Stan Marsh,"Look, these Russian guys all have blogs talking about this like it's just some big diversion for something much bigger!"
946,11,4,Female Agent 2,"[with a stack of papers] Sir, these kids are right. We've just received intel that Russian terrorists are believed to be responsible for the threat."
947,11,4,CIA Leader 2,Where's the intel from?
948,11,4,Female Agent 2,We just read it on Drudge Report.
949,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, we already have the guy's blog. Maybe we can find an address and check it out on MapQuest."
950,11,4,CIA Leader 2,We do this my way! I'm the one in charge!
951,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,[he and Stan look at each other] ...Not anymore you're not.
952,11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Oh, snap. [walks off dejected]"
953,11,4,Butters Stotch,"[makes his move] Whoopee! I captured another one of your pieces, Baahir. [outside, Cartman runs up to the window and crashes through it.]"
954,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Uuugh! [lies motionless for a few seconds, then gets up]"
955,11,4,Butters Stotch,Oh hey Eric.
956,11,4,Eric Cartman,[walks up to Baahir and grabs him by the collar] Where is the detonator!
957,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",The what?
958,11,4,Eric Cartman,You have exactly five seconds before I start dropping serious apple juice farts on your face! One!
959,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",Leave me alone! [heads for the front door and walks out. Cartman follows him] Upta!
960,11,4,Butters Stotch,"[watches them leave] Hey, I was about to win!"
961,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Stop, terrorist, or I will shoot you! [A black van pulls up next to them and the side door slides open. Three real terrorists jump out and aim their semiautomatics at the two boys]"
962,11,4,Terrorist 1,"[olive-colored] Get in the van! [Both boys are scared, but Cartman backs away]"
963,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh, that's cool. I'm actually not... playing anymore."
964,11,4,Terrorist 1,[they aim their guns at Cartman] Get in the van!
965,11,4,Aide 3,"That's it! We don't have a choice anymore! Somebody is going to have to go in, and try to disarm the snuke manually!"
966,11,4,EOD Leader,"No, it's too dangerous! That snatch has not seen action in over 30 years! It could be toxic!"
967,11,4,Brian,[overhearing it] I'll do it! I'll check out Ms. Clinton's snizz.
968,11,4,Eric Cartman,Let me go! Please! I am just a little boy!
969,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,You called and warned the government of our plans! What you don't know is that we are simply mercenaries! We were paid to set up the snuke so that the real enemy of America could attack!
970,11,4,Eric Cartman,That's cool. I'm fine with Muslims invading.
971,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,[aims the semiautomatic at him] Do you really think Muslims are behind this terrorist threat?!
972,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Uhh yes, of course?"
973,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,"America had other enemies before the Muslims, you know. Who is America's oldest enemy?"
974,11,4,Eric Cartman,The Russians?
975,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Before that.
976,11,4,Eric Cartman,The Germans?
977,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Before that.
978,11,4,Eric Cartman,The Germans again?
979,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Before that! I am talking about the oldest threat to America! The greatest enemy America has ever known!
980,11,4,Eric Cartman,You can't possible mean...?
981,11,4,Captain,"Two hundred years we've waited. Finally. We will get those traitors to the Crown! [gets a call and answers it on his cell phone] Yes, Your Majesty?"
982,11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,The Russians are ready to set off the diversion. Full sail.
983,11,4,Captain,"Full sail, Your Majesty?"
984,11,4,Aide 3,"All right, Brian, this is it. Get in there and see if you can disarm the snuke in Ms. Clinton's snatch."
985,11,4,Brian,"[diving in slowly, has radio communication with the booth] All right. I'm nearing her snizz now."
986,11,4,EOD Leader,God help him.
987,11,4,Aide 3,"What do you see, Brian?"
988,11,4,Brian,It's dark... cold...
989,11,4,Aide 3,"You're doing fine, Brian. Get as close as you can... Y-you have to look inside the snizz."
990,11,4,Brian,"Uh, uh, all right, I'm looking. Yes, I see... I see the device! [begins to cough]"
991,11,4,Aide 3,"You're doin' great, Brian. Hang in there."
992,11,4,Brian,"There's um, metal housing... some kind of three-pronged triggering mechanism that... Wait there's... there's something else here! There's something... [static fills the transmission and the aide tries to restore communication]"
993,11,4,Aide 3,"Say again, Brian."
994,11,4,Brian,"[amid heavy static] There's something perched on the snuke's coil... Oh God, it's looking at me!"
995,11,4,EOD Leader,"[takes control] Brian, get out of there!"
996,11,4,Brian,Wha... what are you?! I have no qualm with you! Stay back! Stay back I- agh! Aaagh!
997,11,4,EOD Leader,"Brian? Brian, what's happening?"
998,11,4,Brian,"It's... eating my head! It's eating my head! [the camera zooms back to show his body gyrating helplessly, then being spit out by Mrs. Clinton's snizz]"
999,11,4,Hillary Clinton,Hoh my!
1000,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I got it! I got it! According to PayPal, the Russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on Craig's List and got paid through eBay so that Boston could be attacked by... the British."
1001,11,4,Female Agent 2,The British?
1002,11,4,Agent 4,Loyalist Red Coats!
1003,11,4,Chase,"Sir, I found the Russian's eHarmony account! It does list an address in South Park!"
1004,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,All right! MapQuest the address!
1005,11,4,Chase,I'll use Google Maps. It has live traffic.
1006,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,Good thinking
1007,11,4,CIA Leader 2,"Sir, we have the terrorists' location. IM'ing you now."
1008,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,"[warmly shakes a terrorist's hand] It was good knowing you, comrade."
1009,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",Please. Think about what you are doing. The British are just using you; you're going to die.
1010,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,"Yes, but we will be rich."
1011,11,4,Head Agent,"[outside] Left flank, prig prang and clear! Go go go! [the doors to the hideout fly open and CIA agents pour in, with the CIA Vice Head supervising the riad]"
1012,11,4,Mr Thompson,"[last to enter, gun drawn] The game is over! Get down on the ground!"
1013,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,How did they find us?
1014,11,4,Mr Thompson,We know about everything! Your diversion to help the Red Coats is over!
1015,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,It doesn't matter. The detonator is on a timer. You are too late! In three minutes! [the camera quickly moves to the detonator: 12:56:57 and counting. Four seconds later the power is shut off] What the hell?!
1016,11,4,Head Agent,The power went out!
1017,11,4,Mr Thompson,Well so then what time is it? [the power returns and the detonator's timer is reset to a blinking 12:00:00]
1018,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,Oh crap.
1019,11,4,Mr Thompson,"Take 'em down! [the agents fire away. One after one, terrorists go down, dead. Vladimir climbs a wooden ladder to the hideout's roof]"
1020,11,4,Vladimir and other terrorists,"No! I don't want to die without being paid! [an agent shoots him down, he hits the floor and blows up. CIA agents remove the ropes from Cartman and Baahir]"
1021,11,4,Mr Thompson,"[places a call] The detonator is secured, general. You are cleared to proceed."
1022,11,4,Captain,The Rebel Americans know of our attack?!
1023,11,4,Soldier,How?
1024,11,4,Captain,"Fire at will! [the soldiers quickly aim and fire. The bullets have no effect, as the jets simply unload their bombs on the ships and sink them.]"
1025,11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,Yes?
1026,11,4,Captain,"Your Majesty, the attack has failed. We were... unable to end the American Revolution."
1027,11,4,Queen Elizabeth II,"I see. [sets the phone down, takes a loaded gun to her mouth, and shoots her brains out. She falls forward and hits the ground, dead.]"
1028,11,4,Mr Thompson,"[walking into view] Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again."
1029,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people. Because, actually, most of the world hates us."
1030,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Well Baahir, I was thinking that maybe I owe you an apology."
1031,11,4,"Baahir and his parents, the Hakeems",Really?
1032,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes, but then I realized that, technically, I don't. Because by being suspicious of you I saved your life and everyone else's. So really, you owe me an apology. But that's cool."
1033,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"...You didn't save everyone, I did! You were just out harassing Muslims!"
1034,11,4,Eric Cartman,"But if I hadn't called you in the first place to check out the Muslim, you would have just stayed in bed sick all day, right?"
1035,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,...Maybe. [looks away]
1036,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Maybe? If I hadn't called you, you wouldn't have been on your computer checking out the Clinton rally. That means my intolerance of Muslims saved America."
1037,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,...That is so missing the point.
1038,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off, yes or no?!"
1039,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,"The-that's not the right way to look at it, I-"
1040,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes or no, Kyle?!"
1041,11,4,Kyle Broflovski,No! ...Not... not like you're saying.
1042,11,4,Eric Cartman,"But that's all I'm saying: today, bigotry and racism saved the day. Baahir, you get this, right? [Baahir's parents approach, looking around at all the activity in front of their house]"
1043,11,4,Mr Hakeem,"Baahir! Get away from that disgusting child! Get back home and start packing your things! We are leaving this whole intolerant country! [Mr. Hakeem nudges Baahir forward, and the family leaves]"
1044,11,4,Butters Stotch,Awwwww.
1045,11,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay. Who got rid of the Muslims, huh? [raises his own hand] That was all me. Simple thank you will suffice."
1046,11,5,Randy Marsh,"[inside] ...In my Easter Bonnet, with all the frills upon it, I'll be the grandest lady in the Easter parade."
1047,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Look at that one, huh? Half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker. I'm good. [sets it into the egg tray]"
1048,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Uh, can I ask a question? Why do we do this?"
1049,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Wha... what do you mean, ""Why do we do this?"" It's Easter!"
1050,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Right, so, why do we color eggs? [Shelly makes a cross face]"
1051,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Wulll, ssso that the Easter bunny can hide them."
1052,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but why?"
1053,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, Easter celebrates the day that Jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins."
1054,11,5,Stan Marsh,So we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them?
1055,11,5,Randy Marsh,That's right.
1056,11,5,Stan Marsh,"You don't see the missteps in logic with that? [Randy is unfazed, while Shelly, Sharon, and Marvin look at Stan disapprovingly] Look, I'm just saying that somewhere between Jesus dying on the Cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a, a gap of information."
1057,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, just dye your Goddamned eggs!"
1058,11,5,Stan Marsh,[leaves his seat] I don't feel like coloring eggs! I don't get it!
1059,11,5,Randy Marsh,What is wrong with him?!
1060,11,5,Sharon Marsh,"Well, he's just getting older, Randy. Maybe he's figured out the Easter bunny isn't real. [continues dying her egg. Randy slams his palms down on the table angrily. Sharon is taken aback.]"
1061,11,5,Randy Marsh,[rising] You know so little! [leaves]
1062,11,5,Eric Cartman,"And I want a Baltor soldier doll for Easter, and five Crash'n'Go RC cars, you got that?! Do you have that?!"
1063,11,5,Mall Bunny,"Ahh, don't you think that's-"
1064,11,5,Eric Cartman,"Nono! You don't ask me questions! You are a rabbit! I am a human. So if you don't bring me what I want for Easter, I can fucking kill you!"
1065,11,5,Easter Bunny Aide,Smile! [takes a picture and Cartman hops off]
1066,11,5,Eric Cartman,"Bye, Easter bunny! [leaves]"
1067,11,5,Mall Bunny,[watches him leave] Oh my God. [Stan walks up and sits on the bunny's lap. The bunny notices]
1068,11,5,Stan Marsh,"All right, can you explain to me what's going on?"
1069,11,5,Mall Bunny,Huh?
1070,11,5,Stan Marsh,What is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that? What does that have to do with Jesus dying on the Cross? [no reply] It is symbolic? Are you trying to reference something that happened in Biblical times? [nudges him] Answer me!
1071,11,5,Mall Bunny,"Look, kid ahh, I'm j-, I'm just a guy in a costume."
1072,11,5,Stan Marsh,I know that! But I figure you must have some knowledge of what Easter's about if you're playing the Easter Bunny at the mall!
1073,11,5,Mall Bunny,"Huhuh, Easter's just Easter. Just, just go with it, kid."
1074,11,5,Stan Marsh,"No, I'm not gonna just go with it! I'm gonna find out what's behind all this! [hops off and walks away]"
1075,11,5,Mall Bunny,"I need a break. Can I have a break? [he gets it and walks up to some payphones nearby. He picks one up and dials a number] We have a problem. Somebody's onto us. Yeah, he's askin' a lot of questions. Only a matter of time before he finds out what Easter's really about. Yes, I understand what must be done. Call the others. [hangs up the phone]"
1076,11,5,Stan Marsh,Mom? Dad? [reaches the second floor] Anybody home?
1077,11,5,Randy Marsh,"[voice only] Not now, Stanley, I'm on the toilet! [Stan runs to the restroom door and pounds on it]"
1078,11,5,Stan Marsh,Dad! You've gotta help me! [looks around]
1079,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Hang on, I'm taking a crap."
1080,11,5,Stan Marsh,Dad! There's Easter bunnies chasing me!
1081,11,5,Randy Marsh,What?
1082,11,5,Stan Marsh,"They chased me from the mall! I don't know what they want! [hears the front door breaking open] They're coming in! Dad, open the door! [the bathroom door opens and Randy looks out, wearing some bunny ears and a bunny snout with buck teeth.] Dad?"
1083,11,5,Randy Marsh,"We... need to talk, Stan. [the Easter bunnies run up the stairs] Ih, it's okay guys."
1084,11,5,Gray Hare,Randy?
1085,11,5,Randy Marsh,Yeah. 'Cause it turns out the kid we're after is my son.
1086,11,5,Purple Hare,Ohhh.
1087,11,5,Randy Marsh,Tell the Grand Hare everything is okay. I'll take it from here.
1088,11,5,Randy Marsh,"I wanted to keep this from you, Stan. I really wanted to wait until you were older but... you just had to keep asking questions!"
1089,11,5,Stan Marsh,Why were those other rabbit guys chasing me?!
1090,11,5,Randy Marsh,"We have to be careful when we think somebody's onto us. [turns to face him] We are all part of a secret society, Stan. A very ancient, very important society of men who follow the way of the Rabbit, and protect the secret of the Easter bunny. We are called... the Hare Club For Men."
1091,11,5,Stan Marsh,"[not impressed, but curious] Does Mom know about this?"
1092,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Duh, it's the Hare Club For Men. Chicks wouldn't understand."
1093,11,5,Stan Marsh,I don't understand!
1094,11,5,Randy Marsh,I belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years! Our identities have to be protected!
1095,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Could, could you, take off, the ears, please?"
1096,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you don't seem to understand how serious this is! The secret of Easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world!"
1097,11,5,Stan Marsh,So what is the secret of Easter?
1098,11,5,Randy Marsh,"I can't tell you. You have to be allowed into the Society first, but... but perhaps... it's time."
1099,11,5,Randy Marsh,"I always knew this day would come, when my son would be brought into the society. Reminds me of the day I was brought in by my father."
1100,11,5,Stan Marsh,Grandpa's in it too?
1101,11,5,Randy Marsh,Of course. Marshes have been in the Hare Club For Men for generations. All the way back to the beginning.
1102,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Dad, do I have to wear this bag over my head the entire time?"
1103,11,5,Randy Marsh,"You aren't a member yet. You can't know where our secret meetings take place. We're going to a distant location, an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away."
1104,11,5,Stan Marsh,"You mean the old Galveston Lodge? [Randy's taken aback at Stan's memory and so thinks about what to do next. After a while, he decides to remove the bag]"
1105,11,5,Randy Marsh,Dammit.
1106,11,5,Hare 1,Hey Bill.
1107,11,5,Hare 2,Evenin' Marcus.
1108,11,5,Hare 3,"Heh heh hey, look at you!"
1109,11,5,Hare 4,Hey everybody.
1110,11,5,Hare 5,"Stan Marsh, welcome! You must be very excited."
1111,11,5,Stan Marsh,Must I?
1112,11,5,Marvin Marsh,There he is! There's my grandson!
1113,11,5,Stan Marsh,Hi Grandpa.
1114,11,5,Marvin Marsh,"I'm proud of ya, Billy."
1115,11,5,Stan Marsh,...Stan.
1116,11,5,Pink Hare,"Tonight, we determine if a new member is worthy of protecting the Secret. Bring out... the rabbit."
1117,11,5,Hares,"Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine.
In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
[two Hares carry the rabbit forward in a gilded cage]
Hippitus hoppitus reus Domine.
[they set the rabbit before the Pink Hare and everyone genuflects... except for Stan. Randy looks up and has him genuflect as well]"
1118,11,5,Pink Hare,"All hail the cute rabbit, Snowball!"
1119,11,5,Hares,Hail Snowball. [all rise as the Pink Hare approaches Stan]
1120,11,5,Pink Hare,"Stan Marsh, are you ready to hear the secret of Easter?"
1121,11,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
1122,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Are you sure, son? Once you hear the secret, you will be bound to The Hare Club For Men forever."
1123,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I wanna know already."
1124,11,5,Pink Hare,"Very well. At the Last Supper, Jesus Christ met with his 12 Disciples. It was there that- [interrupted by breaking windows and ninjas pouring in]"
1125,11,5,Gray Hare,They found us! [the other Hares arm themselves]
1126,11,5,White Hare,"[with rainbow vest] Protect Snowball! [a door is turned down, and a ninja, a monk, and a layman enter the lodge. Another door breaks down and another monk enters with three ninjas]"
1127,11,5,Brown Hare,"They're everywhere! [Hares and ninja battle each other, killing each other as Stan watches]"
1128,11,5,Randy Marsh,"[approaches Stan with Snowball] Come on, we've gotta go! [a ninja spots him and quickly fires an arrow into his left leg. He stumbles] Stan, take Snowball and get out of here!"
1129,11,5,Stan Marsh,Where am I supposed to go?
1130,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Just get out of here! [Stan turns around and heads for the entrance. A ninja comes up behind him, but Randy grabs the ninjas leg and holds on, forcing the ninja to fall. The ninja tries to kick Randy off]"
1131,11,5,Layman,Where is the rabbit?!
1132,11,5,Hare 6,Where are you taking us?
1133,11,5,Hare 7,"No! I'm not goin' anywhere! [the layman walks up and shoot him in the head, and he falls.]"
1134,11,5,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ! [a monk has Randy restrained]
1135,11,5,Layman,"Who did you give the rabbit to?! [slaps Randy, Randy spits back. The layman punches Randy in the stomach and has him rounded up with the others] Search the area! The boy could not have gotten far!"
1136,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh no... [looks around, then runs off]"
1137,11,5,Stan Marsh,Help.
1138,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,What happened?
1139,11,5,Stan Marsh,My Dad's in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the Hare Club For Men they protect the secret of Easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of Snowball.
1140,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,...I'm kind of finger painting right now.
1141,11,5,Stan Marsh,"[enters anyway] Dude, they took my Dad away. They even shot one of his fellow hares. And now they're after me! [turns around and fires off a few questions] Do you know anything about Easter? What is the connection between Jesus and rabbits and colored eggs?"
1142,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I'm Jewish. I have no idea."
1143,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Nelson. [crawls towards him] Nelson? Nelson, say something."
1144,11,5,Nelson,[reclining against a cage wall] My legs. I... I think they're broken.
1145,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Nelson, do you know where we are? Where did they take us?"
1146,11,5,Nelson,"Don't know... we traveled for hours... kept blacking out... [coughs. Randy lets go and crawls back, but sees someone standing before him]"
1147,11,5,Randy Marsh,You...
1148,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi, we'd like to speak to a [reads the name from a slip of paper] Professor Teabag? [Stan is still carrying Snowball]"
1149,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,What is it in regard to? [the professor appears at the far end with a walking stick]
1150,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,The history of Easter.
1151,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"[walks slowly towards the boys] Sorry boys, it's a little late for me to be giving lectures. [turns around and walks away]"
1152,11,5,Stan Marsh,Please? Do you know anything about the Hare Club For Men? [the professor stops and turns around]
1153,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,The Keepers? [walks towards them] The Guardians of the Secret?
1154,11,5,Stan Marsh,[the butler steps aside] My Dad is in it. This... rabbit is too somehow.
1155,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,Come on in. [smiles]
1156,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,The Hare Club For Men has been around for centuries. One of its most famous members was Leonardo da Vinci. [on a large widescreen TV is a picture of The Last Supper] Behold the Last Supper. The dinner Christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified. What food do you see on the table?
1157,11,5,Stan Marsh,Just bread...
1158,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Really? Look to Jesus's right. [zooms in and pans to the lower left, then zooms in on an oval shape] The food which is a little different color than the others."
1159,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,It kind of looks like... an egg.
1160,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,Yes. The egg marks the secret. It lies directly in front of... [zooms out and a bright trace appears around the disciple behind the egg] Saint Peter.
1161,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,Who is Saint Peter?
1162,11,5,Stan Marsh,He was the disciple that Jesus made into the first pope.
1163,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Eggsactly. But there's something the Church didn't tell you. In actuality, Peter wasn't a man at all. Saint Peter... was a rabbit. [the boys say nothing for a few seconds]"
1164,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,[flatly] Peter Rabbit.
1165,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Of course, the Church wouldn't allow da Vinci to paint Peter as a rabbit, so he painted him as a man, but left clues. Look closely."
1166,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,I don't see it.
1167,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,Look closelier. [zooms in]
1168,11,5,Stan Marsh,He looks like a guy.
1169,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Look more closelier. [zooms in further, and a pair of rabbit ears appear on Peter's head] With laser technology we can look beneath the paint, the way da Vinci originally painted it. [Peter disappears from the picture and a rabbit appears next to the egg which was in front of Peter] That... is Saint Peter. [Stan jumps a bit] The original Pope of Christianity."
1170,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,I don't believe it.
1171,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Proof is everywhere. Look at the Pope's hat. [a picture of Benedict XVI appears] It makes no sense, except that it was originally designed... [a picture of a rabbit slides in next to that of the pope, and Teabag moves the hat from the pope to the rabbit] for a rabbit."
1172,11,5,Stan Marsh,[looks at the professor] But why would Jesus want a rabbit to run his church?
1173,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Because Jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion. Men can be intolerant; rabbits are pure. But the Catholic Church buried the truth, put a man in charge, and the Hare Club For Men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive."
1174,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,So... the Vatican took Stan's dad?
1175,11,5,Pope Benedict,You dare to mock God by telling people St. Peter was a rabbit?
1176,11,5,Randy Marsh,You monster! You have no right to wear that hat!
1177,11,5,Pope Benedict,Trying to tell people that St. Peter was a rabbit is blasphemy! You must admit you are wrong or burn in hell!
1178,11,5,Randy Marsh,It's saying stupid things like that that made Jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge.
1179,11,5,Layman,"I'm sorry I couldn't bring you the rabbit, Your Holiness, but they know where it is!"
1180,11,5,Pope Benedict,The rabbit you call Snowball is a threat to Christ's Church. Where is the rabbit?!
1181,11,5,Randy Marsh,"I don't know! And even if I did know... well, I'd probably tell you because I don't wanna be here anymore."
1182,11,5,Layman,Take him to be tortured!
1183,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Tortured, huh, but Bill, all this... torturing and ninjas, it just doesn't seem very Christian."
1184,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"[the layman] You asked for the help of the American Catholic League, let us do our job! Take him! [a cardinal and a ninja open the door, take Randy in, and escort him to his torture.]"
1185,11,5,Randy Marsh,"No! No, you bunny-hating bastards! Don't do this!"
1186,11,5,Stan Marsh,I don't get it. Why would the pope be holding my Dad hostage for Snowball?
1187,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"I believe Snowball must be a direct descendant of St. Peter himself, and therefor the true heir of the pope's throne. [the butler is shown polishing a steel vase as some ninjas make their way towards the study]"
1188,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"[notices some ninjas behind him] Mr. Teabag! Get out! [one of the ninjas runs his sword through the butler's head and out his face, killing him]"
1189,11,5,Stan Marsh,They found me!
1190,11,5,Teabag and his Butler,"Boys, get out of here! [takes them to a window and opens it] Head to the woods! I'll try to buy you some time. [Stan and Kyle climb down the ladder he's prepared for them]"
1191,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"[off screen] Check upstairs! [the professor picks up a box of... PEEPS] Upstairs clear! Try the office! [Teabag takes the peeps to a microwave oven nearby and opens the oven's door. He puts the peeps in and sets the timer to 15 seconds. Behind him, two ninjas break into the study]"
1192,11,5,Ninja 1,In here! [Teabag closes his eyes]
1193,11,5,Ninja 2,"What's that? [the peeps begin to expand quickly and fill up the oven. Four seconds left, three, two, one...]"
1194,11,5,Ninja 1,"PEEEEPS! [the oven explodes, spewing peeps everywhere and killing Teabag. Stan and Kyle are running away when they turn to see the whole mansion being destroyed by peep marshmallow]"
1195,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,So what now?
1196,11,5,Stan Marsh,If the pope has my Dad... I have to give him what he wants.
1197,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,You aren't just gonna hand Snowball over?
1198,11,5,Stan Marsh,"What choice do I have?! There's nobody left who can help us! [softly] Wait... unless... maybe there is. [hands Snowball to Kyle] Here, hold this. [walks some distance away from Kyle and prays] Jesus, I know we haven't talked in a long time, and I know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow, but... I don't know what to do. And I could really use your help. [waits for a long time, then peeks with his right eye, then with both, but there's no sign of Jesus. He opens his eyes wide, as normal, and looks up. Kyle looks down at Snowball]"
1199,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,I think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket.
1200,11,5,Announcer,"Live, from the Vatican, it's our Easter Vigil coverage."
1201,11,5,Reporter,"As Holy Saturday comes to an end, the Easter vigil at the Vatican begins. Thousand have turned out to hear the Pope and celebrate the Resurrection. [visitors whip out their cameras and take pictures] For this Easter vigil the Pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor, with a massive rabbit stew. [two chefs stand atop ladders next to a huge cauldron, slicing up ingredients. Bill and a ninja bring in a bunny to toss into the cauldron]"
1202,11,5,Violet Hare,"NOOO! Noo! No, don't put m- [he's thrown in and is boiled to death] AAAAAAAAAAH!"
1203,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, this seems extreme."
1204,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,The child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesn't hand it over.
1205,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Your Holiness, a child has arrived with a the rabbit!"
1206,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Ya see? [the three leave to meet this boy]
1207,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Oh thank God! Hand it over, Stan! They're gonna kill me! Give them the rabbit!"
1208,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Yes, hand it over!"
1209,11,5,Stan Marsh,"First, you have to promise you won't hurt it! And that you'll let everybody go!"
1210,11,5,Pope Benedict,We promise.
1211,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"We swear it, on the cross."
1212,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Just hand over the bunny, Stan!"
1213,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Okay, fine. [a cardinal takes Snowball from Stan, and Randy is released]"
1214,11,5,Randy Marsh,"[reaching his son] Stanley, why did you do that? I would have proudly died for that rabbit."
1215,11,5,Stan Marsh,"You said ""hand over the bunny."""
1216,11,5,Randy Marsh,No! That is not the way we're remembering it!
1217,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Take them into custody! [ninjas come in and put cuffs on Randy and the boys]
1218,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what the hell!"
1219,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, we have zeh rabbit, it's all we need."
1220,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"Don't be soft, Your Holiness! These ""whores"" must be punished in front of everyone!"
1221,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You swore on the cross, fatso!"
1222,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Yeah. Too bad for you... it was a double cross! [cackles]
1223,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Oh, we should've seen that coming!"
1224,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Bill, I'm not sure that double-crossing people is very Christian."
1225,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,It is what Christ would've wanted!
1226,11,5,Jesus Christ,[off-screen] Who are you to say that?! [the clerics look surprised. Jesus approaches them from the entrance of the basilica]
1227,11,5,Pope Benedict,It... can't be.
1228,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Jesus! [as Jesus walks, clergymen genuflect and bow to him]"
1229,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus! [as Jesus walks, clergymen genuflect and bow to him]"
1230,11,5,Singer,He is risen. He is risen. Let the voices sing his praises on this holy day. He is risen!
1231,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Jesus, we thought you died. In Iraq."
1232,11,5,Jesus Christ,I have the power of resurrection. Or have you forgotten? You all seem to have forgotten a lot of things.
1233,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, you did answer my prayer! [grins]"
1234,11,5,Jesus Christ,"Actually, I was answering the prayer of Nick Donovan."
1235,11,5,Purple Hare 2,"Ohh, that's me Neato!"
1236,11,5,Jesus Christ,"This is exactly why I put a rabbit in charge of the Church, Benedictus! Because men are so easily led astray. St. Peter was a rabbit. And a rabbit should be Pope."
1237,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Kill him!
1238,11,5,Pope Benedict,What?!
1239,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,He goes against the Church. He must die!
1240,11,5,Pope Benedict,"All right, that does it, Bill. I'm pretty sure that killing Jesus is not very Christian."
1241,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,You are soft! Weak! You leave me no choice: take them! [two ninjas apprehend Jesus]
1242,11,5,Jesus Christ,What are you doing?! [two others arrest Benedict]
1243,11,5,Pope Benedict,I am the Pope!
1244,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"You are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the Lord! [removes the papal tiara and places it on his own head] The Easter vigil will go on as planned! [walks to a clear spot with Snowball, so all could see.] Every Hare Club member, young and old, will watch as their precious savior dies!"
1245,11,5,Jesus Christ,"What is your problem, guy?!"
1246,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Lock up those two Jews! [referring to Kyle and Jesus] We'll deal with them later.
1247,11,5,Stan Marsh,"No! No! [Stan and Randy are taken away in one direction, Kyle and Jesus in another, Benedict in still another]"
1248,11,5,Reporter,"A strange turn of events here at the Vatican: Pope Benedictus has stepped down, ushering the new era of... Pope Bill Donohue"
1249,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,My people! This Easter I'm gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier! [the crowds cheer loudly]
1250,11,5,Randy Marsh,No! Listen! We aren't rabbits! [a ninja punches him in the stomach] Oof.
1251,11,5,Pope Benedict,"Forgive me, Jesus."
1252,11,5,Jesus Christ,We'll never get out in time to stop him!
1253,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,Don't you have any superpowers?
1254,11,5,Jesus Christ,"[throws the file away] Not as a mortal. Only in death. Wait. That's it. We have no choice, Kyle. You're going to have to kill me."
1255,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1256,11,5,Jesus Christ,Stab me with this. [brings out a small dagger] If I die I can resurrect outside the bars.
1257,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,N-no way! Do it yourself.
1258,11,5,Jesus Christ,"Suicide is blasphemy. There's no choice here, Kyle!"
1259,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you don't understand, I'm a Jew. I have a few hang ups about killing Jesus."
1260,11,5,Jesus Christ,Just make it quick. [kneels down and hands the dagger to Kyle] Through the neck. I'll arise again immediately.
1261,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,[looks at the dagger in dismay] Don't make me do this.
1262,11,5,Jesus Christ,"My son, there is no time! Do it!"
1263,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,Eric Cartman can never know about this.
1264,11,5,Jesus Christ,"I understand. And Kyle, happy Easter."
1265,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Happy Easter, Jesus. [stabs Jesus in the neck, as ordered]"
1266,11,5,Jesus Christ,"Awgh! [walks around for a few seconds, groaning and shedding blood here and there. He falls forward and his halo rolls away with a metallic ""clink""]"
1267,11,5,Kyle Broflovski,...Jesus?
1268,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,"Behold, no longer will Easter be about bunnies and colored eggs! Kill the rabbit! [a cardinal holds Snowball over the cauldron]"
1269,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Sorry, little bunny."
1270,11,5,Stan Marsh,"Snowball! [now dressed in rabbits ears and snout like Randy. A bright light appears near one of the obelisks in the center of the piazza, and Jesus' figure appears in the light. The light fades and Jesus is all alone. The crowd oohs and aahs]"
1271,11,5,Tourist,Jesus?
1272,11,5,Jesus Christ,Stop! That rabbit is of holy descent!
1273,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Why won't you go away?!
1274,11,5,Jesus Christ,One man cannot be the voice of the Church!
1275,11,5,Bill Donohue and his ninjas,Enough of this blasphemy! I'm the Pope now! That means I am the voice of God!
1276,11,5,Jesus Christ,"Not anymore. I'm removing you from your position. [brings out a black and yellow glaive, then presses a button in the middle to release the blades, as in a switchblade. He throws it towards Bill, who runs from it. It levels off and slices through Bill's midsection and returns to Jesus. Jesus strikes a pose and catches it with his right hand. The blades disappear into their sheaths. Jesus brings out some sunglasses with his left hand and puts them on, still maintaining the dramatic pose.]"
1277,11,5,Crowd At St. Peter's,YAAAY!
1278,11,5,Stan Marsh,All right Jesus!
1279,11,5,Crowd At St. Peter's,"Sanctum Piter oteum, Deus ore uneum.
Hippitus hoppitus reus homine."
1280,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Your Holiness, what should we tell the world about how to run their lives? [Snowball now sits on the papal throne. Snowball, having no human vocal cords, says nothing] It isn't saying anything."
1281,11,5,Italian Cardinal,"Yes, just as a-Jesus intended it."
1282,11,5,Randy Marsh,"Stanley, I'm so proud of you. You've learned so very much this Easter."
1283,11,5,Stan Marsh,Yeah. I've learned not to ask questions. Just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut.
1284,11,5,Randy Marsh,That's my boy.
1285,11,5,Crowd At St. Peter's,"[in the background] In suspiratoreum, lepus in re sanctum.
Hippitus hoppitus Deus Domine."
1286,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"[enters and drops her books on her desk in anger] Everyone, sit down and shut the fuck up! God damn it! [some papers flutter off the top of the stack. She turns and erases some addition problems she had up on the blackboard earlier] Stupid ass man! They're all the same! [Stan crosses his arms and buries his head in them. He's the only student to do so]"
1287,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, here we go again."
1288,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"All men care about is sex! I spent two hours getting ready for that stupid date! And when the bastard checks out my body, he just says, ""Hey, did you used to be a guy or somethin'?"" I'm a woman now, so what's it matter?!"
1289,11,6,Stan Marsh,"Uh oh, this isn't good."
1290,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"[gets into Stan's face] Did I say something to you, sugartits?!"
1291,11,6,Stan Marsh,[frightened] No ma'am.
1292,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"[heads back to the blackboard] You boys make me sick! You're well on your way to being men, who only think with their penises! I am assigning all of you weekend homework! You are going to read Hemmingway's book, ""The Old Man and the Sea""!"
1293,11,6,Eric Cartman,Have you lost your mind?
1294,11,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we can't read an entire book in one weekend."
1295,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"Oh, that's too bad, dude. Maybe if you boys could keep your penises in your pants once in a while you'd get more done!"
1296,11,6,Butters Stotch,"But Teacher, my penis never slips out of my pants. Eh-except sometimes when I'm wearin' pajamas."
1297,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"If you do not have an essay written on Monday, then you will fail! Is that clear?!"
1298,11,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, how are we supposed to read an entire book over the weekend and write an essay?"
1299,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,Our whole weekend is shot.
1300,11,6,Kenny McCormick,(What the hell are we going to do?!)
1301,11,6,Eric Cartman,"You guys, you guys, relax. We don't have to read the book or write the essay."
1302,11,6,Stan Marsh,We don't?
1303,11,6,Eric Cartman,No. There's people you can hire to do these kinds of things.
1304,11,6,Eric Cartman,Que paso? Que paso? Looking for work? S? Trabajo?
1305,11,6,Laborer 1,[wearing baseball cap with flag] Yeis.
1306,11,6,Laborer 2,"[wearing cap backwards] We looking work, s."
1307,11,6,Eric Cartman,"[holds his arms out in open embrace] Okay, listen up, Mexicans. We need you to read [whips out the book from his back pocket] ""The Old Man and the Sea"" for us. Comprende? ""The Old Mand Y La Mer""."
1308,11,6,Laborer 2,Okay.
1309,11,6,Laborer 1,Sure.
1310,11,6,Laborer 3,[wearing NY baseball cap] Okay.
1311,11,6,Laborer 4,[wearing gray baseball cap] Yeah.
1312,11,6,Eric Cartman,"Here. We need you to work together, read the book and write four essays, comprende? La samaraisia."
1313,11,6,Laborer 2,Okay no problem. That's no problem.
1314,11,6,Laborer 1,"Yeah, we can do that."
1315,11,6,Laborer 5,"S, la samuraisia."
1316,11,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, gracias."
1317,11,6,Stan and Kyle,Gracias.
1318,11,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that is awesome. I had no idea you could do that."
1319,11,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, dude. Havin' Mexicans around totally kicks fuckin' ass."
1320,11,6,Mrs Garrison,They can all rot in hell! Who needs men anyway?! They're God damned arrogant self-centered assholes is what they are! [a woman walks up and gets on the treadmill to her right]
1321,11,6,Woman,"Are you okay, hon?"
1322,11,6,Mrs Garrison,I just hate men is all. It's like all they care about is how hot you look!
1323,11,6,Woman,"Yeah, I've never been into men. That's why I work out here. Since it's women only we don't get oogled at or feel self-conscious."
1324,11,6,Mrs Garrison,Tell me about it! I can't even stretch at a normal gym without some guy trying to stare down my vage.
1325,11,6,Woman,I'm Allyson.
1326,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"Oh, I'm Janet. Janet Garrison. Sorry I'm so pissed off."
1327,11,6,Allyson,"No, I like it. You seem like a very strong woman."
1328,11,6,Janet,"Yeah, I've been told that."
1329,11,6,Allyson,How come I've never seen you down at the girl bar?
1330,11,6,Janet,Girl bar? I never even knew there was such a place.
1331,11,6,Allyson,"Oh you'd love it. It's the only bar in town where women like us can hang out and be ourselves. It's called ""Lebow""."
1332,11,6,Allyson,"Hi Linda, hi Kate."
1333,11,6,Woman 2,Hey Allyson.
1334,11,6,Woman 3,Who's the new girl?
1335,11,6,Woman 2,Allyson always goes for the butch ones.
1336,11,6,Allyson,"[approaches the bar with Janet] Hey Nell. What's up, Tracy?"
1337,11,6,Janet,Oowhat a great place. All the girls here seem to know each other.
1338,11,6,Allyson,"Yeah. Well, most of the girls here have done each other. [gets a glass and a beer and pours the beer into the glass.]"
1339,11,6,Janet,He-yeah. Done what?
1340,11,6,Allyson,You know. [smiles] Had sex. [passes the beer to Janet and orders a second beer for herself.]
1341,11,6,Janet,"[looks around] Oh my God, this is a lesbian bar?"
1342,11,6,Allyson,Yeah. I... thought you understood that.
1343,11,6,Janet,Oh jeez. [fans herself]
1344,11,6,Allyson,"I'm sorry. I thought you knew what ""girl bar"" meant."
1345,11,6,Janet,But I'm not a- ...whoa! Who-o-o-o-oa. [moves away]
1346,11,6,Allyson,"Janet, I'm really sorry. It's just that at the gym you said you didn't like being with men, so I thought you were a-"
1347,11,6,Janet,I don't like being with men! They're perverted selfish pigs!
1348,11,6,Allyson,Have you... never even... thought... of being... with another woman?
1349,11,6,Janet,"Oho goodness no! Of course I haven't. I mean... really I don't even understand how two women can make love. I mean un, unless they just kinda [demonstrates with her fingers] scissor or something."
1350,11,6,Allyson,"There are a lot of ways to make love, Janet."
1351,11,6,Janet,I guess I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little ...titillated.
1352,11,6,Allyson,"Could I... maybe kiss you? [gets close, but Janet turns and walks away]"
1353,11,6,Janet,"Oh, this is wrong! You're another woman; it doesn't make sense!"
1354,11,6,Allyson,"Is it wrong, Janet? Let your inhibitions go. Let's just have fun tonight. [they hold hands] No commitments. [Allyson lets go] Just fun. [she grabs her hand and they close in for the kiss]"
1355,11,6,Janet,"Oh yeah, scissor! Yeah, scissor me Allyson!"
1356,11,6,Allyson,"Janet, you're crazy!"
1357,11,6,Janet,"Oh, this is hot scissoring! Ohh! Scissor me timbers!"
1358,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,They'd better be done with the book reports! School starts in 15 minutes!
1359,11,6,Eric Cartman,"They'll be done. [whistles to get the laborers' attention.] Que paso? Que paso? [the laborers approach] All right, did you read the book?"
1360,11,6,Laborers,"S, s."
1361,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,What was it about? Ih-in case our teacher asks us.
1362,11,6,Laborer 1,"Eet starts there the old man, and his job is to catch the feesh, so he get in the boht, to try and catch feesh."
1363,11,6,Laborer 2,"Saw he catch the feesh, but the feesh is very strong, so the old man, cannot reel in the feesh."
1364,11,6,Laborer 5,So then he fight the feesh. Some more. And he finally catch the feesh.
1365,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,"He catches the feesh so, then he can make money."
1366,11,6,Laborer 1,"No, because on the way home, the sharks come and eat the feesh. And so, he no make money. [all five laborers take off their hats and put them against their chests in mourning]"
1367,11,6,Stan Marsh,"That's it, that's the whole story?"
1368,11,6,Laborer 1,S.
1369,11,6,Eric Cartman,"All right, did you write the four essays?"
1370,11,6,Laborer 1,"S, we all wrote essays for you. [the laborers put their caps back on]"
1371,11,6,The Boys,[all thumbs up] All right!
1372,11,6,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's have 'em."
1373,11,6,Laborer 4,Have what?
1374,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,You said you all wrote essays.
1375,11,6,Laborer 1,"Well, my ese lives in Miami. I wrote to him like you said, but I don't think he got the letter yet."
1376,11,6,Laborer 2,I wrote my ese in Albuquerque.
1377,11,6,Laborer 5,"I wrote three eses: my ese back home, my ese in Denver, and my ese in Glenwood even wrote me back. ""Thanks for writing me, ese."" [the boys are stunned]"
1378,11,6,Kenny McCormick,(Uh oh...)
1379,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're totally fucked now!"
1380,11,6,Eric Cartman,Why the hell would we pay you to write your friends?!
1381,11,6,Laborer 1,We thought it was kind of strange.
1382,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,"This is your fault, Cartman! Now we're gonna fail!"
1383,11,6,Stan Marsh,"You guys, school starts in ten minutes!"
1384,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,Son of a bitch! [the boys turn and head for school]
1385,11,6,Stan Marsh,"[sees Clyde] Clyde? Clyde! Heyhey Clyde! [Clyde turns around] You didn't finish your essay either, right?"
1386,11,6,Clyde Donovan,"No, I got it done. [turns and walks to his desk. Jimmy walks up beside the boys]"
1387,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, did you finish your book report?"
1388,11,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah. I feel pretty good about it. I finished my whole book report and, I got a really nice letter from my ese who works down at the U-Haul. [walks off, leaving the boys dumbfounded]"
1389,11,6,Eric Cartman,Crap! [the boys head for their seats]
1390,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,We're dead.
1391,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"[dances into the room and sings] Hello, class. Here's my little desk [strokes it gently], my nice lil chalkboard. [hugs it. The boys are surprised at her behavior]"
1392,11,6,Eric Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, about our book reports."
1393,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"[acting bashful] Oho, that's okay Eric. If you need a little more time with your homework, just say so."
1394,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Cartman, then at Stan. Stan looks back at both of them] Really?"
1395,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"Kids, I need to tell you something that you might find shocking. [sighs] I'm gay. [silence follows]"
1396,11,6,Stan Marsh,Again?
1397,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"[sits on the edge of her desk, right leg over left] It was a shock to me too. I... met another woman and... we went to this fabulous bar called ""Les Bos"" where I finally felt at home. Allyson and I talked, and really opened up to each other and... then we... [demonstrates] scissored all night long."
1398,11,6,Butters Stotch,You have to be careful with scissors.
1399,11,6,Mrs Garrison,"But listen, I am not going to just rush into a relationship with Allyson. I'm a late-in-life lesbian. So I need to play the field for a while, right? [closes her eyes] Oh I'm so happy."
1400,11,6,Eric Cartman,That's great! Let's hear it for Teacher being a lesbian!
1401,11,6,Class,Yay!
1402,11,6,Mrs Garrison,[blushing and hides behind her hands] Teeheeheehee.
1403,11,6,Janet,"[now confident] Hey Tracy, hey Kate."
1404,11,6,Tracy,Hi Janet.
1405,11,6,Janet,"Lookin' hot, Linda. Wanna go somewhere and scissor later on? [moves away]"
1406,11,6,Linda,[Woman 2] Huh?
1407,11,6,Janet,Hey Patty.
1408,11,6,Patty,"What's up, Janet."
1409,11,6,Janet,"[lights a cigarette] Ooo, stop giving me that look. Scissoring me with your eyes."
1410,11,6,Big Woman,"Hey Janet, why don't you pick up on your own girl? [Janet flicks the cigarette away and leaves her seat, comes up behind the big woman and pulls her down on her stool to the ground and starts punching her.]"
1411,11,6,Janet,"Oh yeah, dyke fight! [they roll around on the floor and the big woman gets away. The other women gather to watch. the big woman lands a kick to Janet's groin] You kicked me right in the pussy! [the fight resumes and they tumble into a booth, fighting all the way to the floor again. The big woman fights Janet off, but Janet gets turned on and starts having sex...] Uh? Oh! Oh, we're scissoring. Oh yeah, scissor! [the big woman, distracted for a moment, goes back to attacking Janet.]"
1412,11,6,Lesbian 4,"You guys. You guys, stop it. Listen to me, everybody. I got some bad news."
1413,11,6,Lesbian 5,"What is it, Katie?"
1414,11,6,Katie,They're closing down the bar. For good!
1415,11,6,Linda,Closing it down? They can't do that.
1416,11,6,Lesbian 6,[blonde] This is our home.
1417,11,6,Janet,"Yeah, this is our home."
1418,11,6,Katie,"Well it's true, I just talked to the owners. They've sold the bar to Persians."
1419,11,6,Janet,Persians?!
1420,11,6,Tracy,So where are we supposed to go?
1421,11,6,Janet,We aren't going anywhere! We have a history here! Persians are closing this bar over my dead lesbian body!
1422,11,6,Janet,"Mayor, this is an outrage! We are being discriminated against as lesbians!"
1423,11,6,Mayor McDaniels,You're a lesbian now?
1424,11,6,Janet,That's right. A proud lesbian! And our home is being taken away!
1425,11,6,Mayor McDaniels,The bar has been sold to Persian club owners. I don't know what you want me to do about it.
1426,11,6,Janet,"Forbid the transaction! This is happening all over the country, Mayor. Lesbian bars being bought out, shut down, it isn't right!"
1427,11,6,Lesbians,"Yeah, that's right!"
1428,11,6,Mayor McDaniels,"I'm sorry, but my hands are tied. The new owners plan to start redecorating the bar tomorrow. You have to be out by then."
1429,11,6,Janet,"[approaches the desk] Have you seen how Persians decorate? They will cover that bar in cheesy blue carpeting, white statues and gold curtain rods to the point that you will want to puke!"
1430,11,6,Mayor McDaniels,"Mrs. Garrison, get out of here."
1431,11,6,Tracy,"Well, here's to some great times at this place."
1432,11,6,Lesbian 7,Yeah. Guess we'll just have to find somewhere else to hang out.
1433,11,6,Janet,"Now, come on gals! I can't believe what I'm hearing! We can't just give up!"
1434,11,6,Allyson,"Well, what are we supposed to do, Janet?"
1435,11,6,Janet,"We stand and fight! When the Persians come we tell them ""We aren't leaving Les Bos."""
1436,11,6,Katie,"Actually, it's ""Lebow""."
1437,11,6,Janet,"[faces Katie with a ready fist to be pumped] No, it's Les Bos! [addressing all the lesbians] We... are Lesbos! And as Lesbos, we cannot just stand and watch as one girl bar after another gets shut dowwwwwn!"
1438,11,6,Linda,[coming into view] The Persians have sent somebody to talk to us.
1439,11,6,Emir,"Hello, my name is Emir Hadi. My boss sent me over here because he heard that you were upset about us trying to take over the bar."
1440,11,6,Lesbian 6,"Yes, we are."
1441,11,6,Emir,"Well, we want to assure you that when this place becomes another Club Persh, you will all still be 100% welcome. All they want is to make the place really nice. We're going to put down some lovely blue carpet, and gold curtain rods."
1442,11,6,Janet,I knew it! I knew it!
1443,11,6,Emir,But you are still welcome to come. My boss wants you to know that you will not be discriminated against in any way.
1444,11,6,Janet,Would you allow straight people in? Men?
1445,11,6,Emir,Well... we would allow whoev-
1446,11,6,Janet,"Choose your next words wisely, Persian! [jabs a finger into Emir's chest. Emir backs away]"
1447,11,6,Emir,"Look uhh, we don't have to offer you anything, so... I don't know why you're being so difficult. This is crazy."
1448,11,6,Janet,"No, this isn't crazy. This... is... Les Bos! [kicks him in the groin and walks away]"
1449,11,6,Emir,Ohhhhh!
1450,11,6,Persian,"How dare you! [Janet is shown in slow motion, her hips swaying back and forth]"
1451,11,6,Narrator,"And so it had begun. By kicking the Persian messenger in the balls, the lesbos had sent a message. [Emir throws up on the floor]. All over the country lesbians heard of the brave standoff."
1452,11,6,Anchor,As a group of lesbians in Colorado are refusing to allow the new owners of their bar in.
1453,11,6,Lesbian 8,Good for them!
1454,11,6,Lesbian 9,You go girls! [she takes a chip and bites into it. The bite is shown in slow motion.]
1455,11,6,Narrator,The Persians returned to their office and told their coworkers how the thirty lesbos were refusing to let them in.
1456,11,6,Persian 2,"Well fine. If they're going to block the entrance, we'll just bring like, sixty of us! I'll call more Persians for help. [turns left and picks up a phone in slow mo, then a fast-forward to dialing the numbers. The dialing is shown in slow motion. Next shot is Les Bos under a sepia sky]"
1457,11,6,Narrator,"The hours pass quickly, and the lesbians boldly stood out in front of their bar to stop the Persians from entering."
1458,11,6,Lesbian 6,"Here they come. [the Persians approach, but stop short]"
1459,11,6,Big Woman,There's so many of them.
1460,11,6,Janet,Lesbos! Positions! [they all take a battle stance]
1461,11,6,Persian 2,Lesbians! Stand aside. We're coming in to redecorate it!
1462,11,6,Janet,The hell you are! You can take your blue carpet and gold curtain rods and shove them up your Persian buttholes!
1463,11,6,Persian 2,All right! Come on! They can't stop all of us! Huuu!
1464,11,6,Persians,[charging forward] Huuu! [slow motion feet are shown]
1465,11,6,Janet,"Lesbos! Remember this day! Remember this fight! [the battle begins with both sides pushing, the line going back and forth] Don't give them an inch! [she gets poked somewhere] Ow! Iranian faggot!"
1466,11,6,Persian 2,"Come on, seriously, let us in!"
1467,11,6,Janet,Never!
1468,11,6,Narrator,"For hours, the Lesbos kept the Persians back, holding them off, keeping them from decorating. [Janet and the second Persian are shown in intense shoving combat] Finally the Persians grew tired. and many of them wanted to go shopping for more designer sunglasses. They retreated. [and threw down their weapons] The Lesbos... had held."
1469,11,6,Janet,Lesbohhhs!
1470,11,6,Lesbians,Huok! Huok!
1471,11,6,Narrator,The Persians who did not go shopping now knew they must face their boss.
1472,11,6,Persian 2,[turns around] Here he comes. [the others turn to see. An opulent Hummer draws closer and closer]
1473,11,6,Narrator,Rauf Xerxes. He sat atop a gold Hummer with customized Gucci accessories which only a Persian would think was cool. [four men pour out of the Hummer and arrange themselves into steps in front of the grille]
1474,11,6,Persian 2,"Mr. Xerxes, the Lesbos wouldn't move. We could not get inside to redecorate."
1475,11,6,Xerxes,"[deep voice] Tumon, how could you have failed me in this simple task? I am so seriously pissed off right now. I could bust a testicle."
1476,11,6,Narrator,And with that the Persian club owner came to a realization.
1477,11,6,Xerxes,I shall have to deal with these lesbos myself.
1478,11,6,Janet,"Girls, I just want to say that I am very proud of you. The way we kept those Persians from takin' over our bar was Les-tastic."
1479,11,6,Allyson,"Well that's great, Janet, but what now? We can't just stay here pushing them away our whole lives."
1480,11,6,Janet,We can't? I think it's pretty fun.
1481,11,6,Linda,We have to have a more solid plan. Something we can use against them permanently.
1482,11,6,Lesbian 1,[WNBA player] Maybe we can dig up some dirt on the club owner.
1483,11,6,Janet,"Hey, that's a great idea, Betsy. We need somebody working on the inside."
1484,11,6,Allyson,Whattaya mean?
1485,11,6,Janet,"If we could get some Persians on our side, we could send them in to try to dig up some dirt on the owner!"
1486,11,6,Allyson,But who's gonna spy on them for us? We don't know any Persians.
1487,11,6,Janet,It's okay. There's people you can hire for this kind of thing.
1488,11,6,Janet,Que paso? Que paso? Looking for work? S? Trabajo?
1489,11,6,Laborer 1,Yeis.
1490,11,6,Laborer 2,"We looking work, s."
1491,11,6,Janet,All right. We need you to infiltrate some Persians who run Club Persh. And dig up some dirt on the owner.
1492,11,6,Laborer 2,Okay.
1493,11,6,Laborer 1,Sure.
1494,11,6,Laborer 3,[wearing NY baseball cap] Okay.
1495,11,6,Laborer 4,[wearing gray baseball cap] Yeah.
1496,11,6,Allyson,"Janet, how is this gonna work? They don't look Persian."
1497,11,6,Janet,"Sure they do. [walks over to one of the laborers, Laborer 1, and works on him] Just have to- gel the hair, put on a silk shirt, some gold chains, and tons of cologne. [shields her eyes from the cologne, then presents the new man] Persian."
1498,11,6,Laborer 1,S. [the two women smile]
1499,11,6,Lesbian 6,Wow!
1500,11,6,Janet,"All right, Mexicans, take the rest of these outfits and see what you can find out. The address is in there too."
1501,11,6,Laborer 1,Okay.
1502,11,6,Laborer 5,No problem.
1503,11,6,Laborer 2,Yes.
1504,11,6,Laborer 4,S. [they turn around and walk away]
1505,11,6,Janet,"And Mexicans, please hurry. Our girl bar has very little time."
1506,11,6,Narrator,"A full day passed, and the Lesbos knew a second Persian attack was imminent. Outside, Lesbo lookouts kept watch, ready to alert the others. The Lesbo leader sat nervously inside. Her plan to dress Mexicans as Persians to act as spies - perhaps it had failed. She looked around at her fellow Lesbos. They were tired. In order to keep her Lesbos awake, she had no choice: she would have to make coffee. [Janet turns around (fast motion) and heads to the kitchen (slow motion). She enters the kitchen (fast motion) and grabs the glass kettle from the coffee maker (slow motion). She turns towards the sink (fast motion), and pours water into the kettle (slow motion). She turns back to the coffee maker (fast motion) and pour the water into it (slow motion). She closes the water cover, opens the coffee cover, gets some coffee, returns (all fast motion), and pours the coffee into the coffee filter (slow motion). She closes the coffee cover (fast motion) and presses the on button (slow motion).] With fresh coffee brewed, the Lesbos found new life, but would it be enough?"
1507,11,6,Lesbian 6,[standing on a booth bench and looking out a window] The Persians are attacking again!
1508,11,6,Janet,"Take positions, Lesbos!"
1509,11,6,Lesbian 11,Get outside! [the lesbians begin to move towards the door]
1510,11,6,Janet,"No wait, wait! That's not the Persians, it's the Mexicans."
1511,11,6,Linda,Really?
1512,11,6,Allyson,How can you tell?
1513,11,6,Janet,Let them through. It's okay.
1514,11,6,Laborer 3,"Hola, como estas?"
1515,11,6,Laborer 4,Hola.
1516,11,6,Janet,Did you uncover anything? Are the Persians doing anything illegal?
1517,11,6,Laborer 4,"Ahh, no. They're not doing anything illegal."
1518,11,6,Janet,A-are you sure?
1519,11,6,Laborer 1,"No, but we did find out a kind of secret about the person in charge."
1520,11,6,Janet,"What secret?! [Laborer 4 hands him some photos] Oh my God, are, are you sure about this?"
1521,11,6,Laborers,S.
1522,11,6,Allyson,"Janet! Janet, the Persian boss is here. He wants to talk to you and you alone."
1523,11,6,Janet,It's okay. It's time I met this rich Persian asshole face to face.
1524,11,6,Xerxes,Why are you lesbians being so difficult?
1525,11,6,Janet,Because we're protecting the only home we have.
1526,11,6,Xerxes,I don't know why you have to be all superlame about this.
1527,11,6,Janet,"You know, a long time ago when I first realized I was a lesbian, I felt isolated, confused. And finally I found a place that accepts me for who I am."
1528,11,6,Xerxes,"Okay, how about this? [stands behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders] I will make you the manager of Club Persh. You'll make good money."
1529,11,6,Janet,"That's a generous offer, Xerxes, but you see, there's something I know about you. [takes Xerxes' left hand and sniffs it] I know you're actually a woman."
1530,11,6,Xerxes,[lets go and backs away quickly] How..? How did you find that out?
1531,11,6,Janet,I hired Mexicans to spy on you! They saw you working out at Curves.
1532,11,6,Xerxes,You don't understand. Women can't be the boss in Persian culture. Nobody can know about this.
1533,11,6,Janet,"Yeah. And you know why? Because men are all assholes! They make you feel ashamed for being a little... big, or, manly looking. [Xerxes wasn't expecting this response] But not Lesbos. We accept other women for who they are inside!"
1534,11,6,Xerxes,You do? Seriously?
1535,11,6,Janet,"Have you never... even thought, of being with another woman before?"
1536,11,6,Xerxes,No. I don't even know how two women... can make love. Unless they just kind of [demonstrates with her fingers] scissor or something.
1537,11,6,Janet,"Ohh yeah! Scissor me, Xerxes!"
1538,11,6,Xerxes,"Ohh, that feels so supercool!"
1539,11,6,Janet,"Yeah, scissor!"
1540,11,6,Xerxes,"Ohh, I'm a new woman!"
1541,11,6,Narrator,"And so it was that Les Bos was saved. The Persians had agreed to keep it a lesbian bar, for no dyke should be without cocktails."
1542,11,6,Janet,"Thanks for everything, Xerxes."
1543,11,6,Xerxes,"No. Thank you, friend."
1544,11,6,Allyson,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be teaching school right now?"
1545,11,6,Janet,The school hired a substitute to cover for me.
1546,11,6,Laborer 1,"Hand so to find the sum of the two fractions, zhyou must always first check for the lowest common denominator. [the five laborers the boys first hired are there]"
1547,11,6,Laborer 2,S.
1548,11,6,Laborers,S. S. Yes. Yes. That's right.
1549,11,6,Laborer 4,S.
1550,11,6,Stan Marsh,These guys are pretty good.
1551,11,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I think I'm actually learning something. [both boys resume taking notes.]
1552,11,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, this time, it's me and Kenny versus you two assholes."
1553,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,Fine.
1554,11,7,Stan Marsh,"[stops] Oh, dude, what's with all the homeless people? [all around the basketball court homeless people loiter or sleep. There's one bum sleeping at center court. The boys walk up to him] Sir, could you move a little, please?"
1555,11,7,Bum,Spare some change?
1556,11,7,Eric Cartman,"[pinches his nose shut] Aw, dude, he smells like Kenny's house. [releases the pinch] Get out of here!"
1557,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, that's not cool. These people have nowhere to go. [a slow pan of the homeless around them] They don't have food or shelter. We have to do something."
1558,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, what are we supposed to do?"
1559,11,7,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, what are we supposed to do?)"
1560,11,7,Eric Cartman,"No, Kyle's right, you guys. We should do something."
1561,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
1562,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. I know what you're thinking, Kyle, and I'm with you. I know exactly what we should do."
1563,11,7,Butters Stotch,[through a bullhorn] Gather 'round and witness the glory as Eric Cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless. [Stan and Kenny prepare the ramp at center court for Cartman]
1564,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, thank you. [to Stan and Kenny] The ramp ready?"
1565,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's all set."
1566,11,7,Clyde Donovan,He won't make it.
1567,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Excuse me, this isn't exactly what I had in mind!"
1568,11,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, here we go! Jimmy? [Jimmy starts the drum roll. Cartman takes off and picks up speed on his way to the ramp. Tweek and Bebe have their fists ready to pump for him. He leaves the ramp successfully, only to land on the bum and hit the ground without injury]"
1569,11,7,Bum,Oh! Aww.
1570,11,7,Eric Cartman,[jumps off his skateboard] Yes! I did it! [tosses his helmet away] I jumped over the homeless! [turns around] Yes!
1571,11,7,Kenny McCormick,(Yehes!)
1572,11,7,Stan Marsh,"That was a sweet idea, Kyle. [smiles]"
1573,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"God damn it, that wasn't my idea!"
1574,11,7,Mayor McDaniels,"All right, people, we need to come up with answers. There are homeless sprouting up all over town. What are we supposed to do? [silence for a few seconds]"
1575,11,7,Fire Chief,"Well, I, I short of had an idea."
1576,11,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Please, Mr. Valmer."
1577,11,7,Mr Valmer,[the fire chief] We could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers. At least that way they'd be pleasant to look at.
1578,11,7,Other Members,"Oh, that's a good one. Good idea. I like it."
1579,11,7,Randy Marsh,"Well I was thinking: We could turn the homeless into tires, so that we'd still have homeless, but we could use them, on our cars."
1580,11,7,Mr Valmer,"Ohh, that's a good one."
1581,11,7,Mr Mackey,"Nice one, Randy."
1582,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,Like it.
1583,11,7,Mayor's Aide,That's like recycling.
1584,11,7,Mrs Testaburger,"All right, enough! I find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive! The homeless aren't monsters, they are people, like you and me!"
1585,11,7,Randy Marsh,"You mean they've adapted, copied our DNA."
1586,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Excuse me. I am the top researcher of homeless studies for Park County. I don't know why more homeless people are showing up in town, but I do know... that we must be extremely careful. If we give them anything, there could be more."
1587,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi. I've uh... [the man faces him] I've been saving up for a new Xbox game but... but I think you could use the money a lot more than I could. Listen I, I want you to take this. [hands him a bill] It's twenty dollars. [drops it into the tin can and backs up, smiling]"
1588,11,7,Bum,Got any more?
1589,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[frowns] No, that... I thought that was a lot."
1590,11,7,Bum,"[turns around and walks off a bit, asking no one in particular] Spare any change?"
1591,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,[sad at the lack of gratitude] You're welcome. [walks back into the house with his head down]
1592,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh crap. [the doorbell rings and Kyle comes down to answer it. Stan, Kenny, and Cartman enter]"
1593,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are all these homeless people doing in front of your house?"
1594,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
1595,11,7,Eric Cartman,There's a bunch outside my house too.
1596,11,7,Bum,"[female] Spare any change, sir?"
1597,11,7,Eric Cartman,No! Fuck off! [slams the door shut]
1598,11,7,Stan Marsh,"I don't get it. My Dad said as long as nobody gave them money, they'd move on."
1599,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,He did?
1600,11,7,Eric Cartman,Well this is bullcrap! Somebody has to be responsible!
1601,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I... kind of gave a homeless guy twenty dollars last night."
1602,11,7,Eric Cartman,You what?!
1603,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh c-come on, that can't be why they're all here. There has to be another reason."
1604,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, what were you thinking?"
1605,11,7,Eric Cartman,"[makes his way to Kyle] Yeah! I can't possibly jump these many homeless people! I won't risk it! I could jump two homeless people, maybe three, but asking me to jump this many is asking me to risk my life, Kyle!"
1606,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't want you to jump them, retard!"
1607,11,7,Bum 1,Spare some change?
1608,11,7,Randy Marsh,"No, sorry, I don't have any change."
1609,11,7,Bum 2,[a few stores down] Got any change?
1610,11,7,Randy Marsh,"No, sorry. [the bum follows him until he passes the third bum]"
1611,11,7,Bum 3,Can you spare some change? [Randy looks back and runs into the fourth bum]
1612,11,7,Bum 4,[holds out his cup] Chaaange?
1613,11,7,Randy Marsh,Huh! I don't have any change. [more bums come out of the woodwork and crowd in on him]
1614,11,7,Bum 5,[an elderly woman] Change?
1615,11,7,Randy Marsh,No!
1616,11,7,Bum 6,"Change? [Randy runs across the street, but...]"
1617,11,7,Bum 7,Spare some change?
1618,11,7,Randy Marsh,[shielding himself with his suitcase] Leave me alone I don't have any change!
1619,11,7,Bum 7,"All right, God bless you, sir."
1620,11,7,Randy Marsh,"Oh, now I feel bad. [goes back to the bum] Here! [tosses some change into the cup] Ahh! [the other bums reach the other side of the street] Hahh! [begins to run, but other homeless people appear, asking for change. Randy moves past them] Nono, that was really all the change I had."
1621,11,7,Bum 7,[jumps into view again] Spare some change?
1622,11,7,Randy Marsh,I just gave you change!
1623,11,7,Bum 8,"[another old woman] Change? [the homeless crowd Randy in and he can't escape. Their pleading takes on a chanting quality: ""Change? Change? Change? Spare some change? God bless. ...""]"
1624,11,7,Randy Marsh,Wahhh! I don't have any more change! [makes his way through the crown of bums] Noo! I don't have any change! I don't have any chaaange! [disappears under the sea of homeless people]
1625,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, that'll be great. Let's also make sure we have enough chairs in the community center for everyone to attend."
1626,11,7,Randy Marsh,"[outside] Waaah! [bangs on the doors] Awwww! [enters, shuts the door behind him, and locks it] Stay away! [implores and pounds on the door] Stay awayhay!"
1627,11,7,Jimbo Kern,"Randy? Randy, what happened?"
1628,11,7,Randy Marsh,Stay awa- ...I don't have any change! [collapses on the floor against the door] I don't have any chaaaahahange!
1629,11,7,Announcer,"This is a News 5 Special Bulletin, with Chris Swollenballs."
1630,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"South Park has become overrun with the homeless. [a shot of the homeless crowd in front of South Park Elementary, then another shot of them in front of Tom's Rhinoplasty] Nearly every square inch of public property is now riddled with homeless, shutting down roadways and making getting around impossible. [a portrait of a homeless woman] Many people are trapped throughout the town. [an aerial shot of the community center. The center is surrounded by homeless people, with the five adults inside it now on the roof]"
1631,11,7,Randy Marsh,Help! Help us!
1632,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's our dads."
1633,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God.
1634,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"In the meantime, South Park citizens are being advised to stay indoors and protect their change."
1635,11,7,Bum 9,[appears behind him in the newsroom] Spare some change?
1636,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,What the? You can't be in here.
1637,11,7,Bum 9,"Ya got any change, sir?"
1638,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,No I don't have any change. How did he get in here?
1639,11,7,Bum 1,Chaaaaange?
1640,11,7,Chris Swollenballs,"No, please. I don't have any change. Honest I don't. I don't have any- [a PLEASE STAND BY screen pops up and the station goes off the air]"
1641,11,7,Eric Cartman,"You see what you did, Kyle?!"
1642,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we have to try and help our stupid parents. [the boys turn off the TV and head outside]"
1643,11,7,Eric Cartman,They're everywhere!
1644,11,7,Mayor's Aide,[pulls up in his car] What are you boys doing? Get in.
1645,11,7,Bum 11,"[knocks on his window] Spare any change, sir?"
1646,11,7,Mayor's Aide,"[throws up his arms and shakes his head vigorously] Ahhhh! [settles down and starts driving] Come on, let's go! [some distance down the street] What the hell were you doing outside?!"
1647,11,7,Stan Marsh,Our parents are stuck on top of a building in town.
1648,11,7,Mayor's Aide,You aren't getting into town! It's completely overrun with these... things. [a bum lands on the windshield]
1649,11,7,The Boys,Ahh! [the bum begins to wash the windshield]
1650,11,7,Mayor's Aide,"No! I don't need my windshield cleaned! Stop it! Stop iiit! [peels off at the first opportunity] Look, our only hope is to talk to the homeless researcher out on Travis Street. He understands what's goin' on better than anybody. Just stick with me, kids. [enters an intersection, but doesn't notice the driver to his left, who's not paying attention to the road. They collide, with the aide dying on the spot]"
1651,11,7,The Boys,"[exit the car uninjured] Aaahhh! [they move along the street, but notice the homeless everywhere. Another collision takes place a block away from them]"
1652,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Holy shit, dude! [behind him, the other three boys move a manhole cover off to one side, opening up a new means of escape]"
1653,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Over here! [Kyle looks back. Cartman and Kenny drop down into the sewer and Kyle walks to the manhole.] Jump down! Go! [Kyle drops down, and finally, Stan]"
1654,11,7,Eric Cartman,"[pinching his nose shut with his left hand as he fans the smell away with his right] Aw man, it really smells like Kenny's house down here."
1655,11,7,Kenny McCormick,"[punches Cartman angrily] (Dude, shut the fuck up about my house!)"
1656,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, Kenny, relax dude. We need to work together."
1657,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Come on, we gotta get to that scientist's house. [they move forward.]"
1658,11,7,Randy Marsh,[lowers his binoculars] No sign of anybody else.
1659,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,[rising from his chair] That's it. I'm gonna make a break for it.
1660,11,7,Randy Marsh,"[turns around to face him] Don't be crazy, Gerald. You'll never get through all those homeless people."
1661,11,7,Stephen Stotch,"And even if you did, what then? You can't drive anywhere."
1662,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"If I can make it through them, maybe I can catch the bus to Fairplay. I have to try."
1663,11,7,Randy Marsh,"You won't make it through, Gerald! [Gerald leaves quickly and heads downstairs. He leaves the community center, only to be hounded by bums begging for change]"
1664,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,[making his way through] Ahh. Ahhhahhahahahh.
1665,11,7,Bums,Change? Change sir? You got some change?
1666,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Don't have any change... Don't have any change... Damn it! All right, you want change? Here. [reaches into his left pocket and tosses some change off to his left]  There! There's some change. All right, a little bit. [reaches into his right pocket and tosses some change off to his right] There you go. Take the change. [leaves, but stops himself] Oh wait. Wait, now I don't have any change left for the bus. Hold on. Can I just get back some of that change, please?"
1667,11,7,Bum 12,"Change, sir?"
1668,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Can I have just a little change for the bus, please? I need a little... anybody have some change? Change? Got any change? [Randy follows Gerald through his binoculars] Change. Change? [Randy lowers his binoculars in horror]"
1669,11,7,Stephen Stotch,What happened?
1670,11,7,Randy Marsh,[closes his eyes] He's become one of them.
1671,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Go away, I I don't have any change."
1672,11,7,Stan Marsh,Are you the head of Homeless Studies?
1673,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Yes. Who are you?
1674,11,7,Stan Marsh,We think this may be our friend's fault. [shows Kyle] He gave one of the homeless twenty dollars yesterday-
1675,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Oh my God. Get in here! Tell me what's going on? [the boys enter and he shuts the door]
1676,11,7,Stan Marsh,There's a bunch of people trapped in the middle of town surrounded by homeless people. W-we can't get to them.
1677,11,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, all right, look! I didn't wanna risk it, but... I think I know what to do. I'll try to jump all those homeless and get to the people on that roof."
1678,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Jump them?
1679,11,7,Eric Cartman,"I jump the homeless professionally. If you can get me a skateboard, I'll try to jump that homeless crowd and save those people."
1680,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, shut up, Cartman. All you did was jump over one homeless guy."
1681,11,7,Eric Cartman,I easily could have cleared another thirty or forty.
1682,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You barely made it over one, fatass!"
1683,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, enough! Cartman jumping more homeless people isn't gonna solve anything right now!"
1684,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,God damn it! I don't want him to jump over more a-
1685,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Boys! Boys! I don't think you quite understand how the homeless function. Perhaps you should come downstairs. To my laboratory. [lightning and thunderclaps follow]
1686,11,7,Randy Marsh,We don't have any change! Go away!
1687,11,7,Linda Stotch,"Anything, Stephen?"
1688,11,7,Stephen Stotch,No. All the phone lines are completely down. [the stairwell door behind them rattles and they turn to face it in fear. Randy steps toward it with his shotgun and cocks it. More knocking on the door]
1689,11,7,A Man,[inside the stairwell] Hello? Ih-it's Steve Garrett from the library. Pu-please let us in.
1690,11,7,Randy Marsh,"Find another place to hide, Steve!"
1691,11,7,Steve Garrett,I I have others with me. We we have nowhere else to go. One woman here is pregnant.
1692,11,7,Stephen Stotch,We can't just leave them out there.
1693,11,7,Steve Garrett,"Let us in! For God's sake, they're coming! No! No, I'm sorry, we don't have any change."
1694,11,7,Linda Stotch,"You have to let them in, Randy."
1695,11,7,Randy Marsh,There isn't enough food for more people up here!
1696,11,7,Steve Garrett,Oh God. One of them is a war veteran. [more knocking] We're gonna have to give him some change.
1697,11,7,Stephen Stotch,This isn't happening!
1698,11,7,Randy Marsh,"All right all right, fine! [approaches slowly and opens the door. The refugees stream forth]"
1699,11,7,Bum 13,"Could you spare some change, sir?"
1700,11,7,Randy Marsh,[shuts the door quickly] Harrrh!
1701,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"I've dissected several homeless to see what make them tick. Their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours. See? Everything is there: heart, lungs, kidneys, they're almost identical to us in every way. Except for one. [a homeless man is chained to a wall by a chain around his neck. The advisor approaches him] The homeless... can survive solely... on change. [pulls out some change]"
1702,11,7,Bum 14,[sticks out his cup and strains to get the money] Change?
1703,11,7,Homeless Advisor,They feed on our change. They need it in order to keep them moving
1704,11,7,Bum 14,Is that... is that some spare change?
1705,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Somehow they're able to take... our change... and turn it into nourishment, sustenance."
1706,11,7,Bum 14,"Spare some of that change, sir?"
1707,11,7,Homeless Advisor,But now watch. [drops some coins into the bum's cup and walks back to the boys. The bum rattles his cup a bit]
1708,11,7,Bum 14,Spare some change?
1709,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"It has already completely forgotten that I've given it change. It just wants... more, change. Look over here. [heads to his left and the boys follow] This one I've kept deprived of change for over three days."
1710,11,7,Bum 15,Chaaaaange?
1711,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,What's it doing?
1712,11,7,Homeless Advisor,It's dying.
1713,11,7,Eric Cartman,Cool.
1714,11,7,Homeless Advisor,I've learned that the nearby city of Evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did. And they were able to stop it.
1715,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"[finds the advisor's office and enters] Excuse me, the front door was open. Can I borrow some change? [other homeless men follow him in]"
1716,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Oh my God, they're coming in! [leads the boys to an escape hatch above some crates] Quick kids, get out of here! You can fit!"
1717,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,[helps Cartman up] What about you?
1718,11,7,Homeless Advisor,Get to Evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless! I'll be all right!
1719,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh! Stop pushing, Kenny."
1720,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Hello? [comes down a spiral staircase] I I'm sorry, I just really need some change for the bus?"
1721,11,7,Bum 16,Change?
1722,11,7,Bum 17,Spare some change?
1723,11,7,Bum 18,Change?
1724,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,Stop it! I really do need change!
1725,11,7,Bum 16,Me too. Change?
1726,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,[outside the lab] Change? [knocks on the lab door] Hello? Do you have any change?
1727,11,7,Bum,[outside the lab] Chaaange?
1728,11,7,Homeless Advisor,"Sorry to take the easy way out. [takes a gun to his right temple and cocks it. An exterior view of his office is shown and a gunshot heard. Back inside, he's still standing, in pain. The bullet went out the left temple, but didn't kill him.] OW! OH, FUCK! OWW! [next he tries shooting through his jaw, and the bullet comes out through his right cheek.] OHHH! AH! GOD! [shoots through his jaw again, and the bullet goes out his right cheek again. This time he gargles and drops on all fours. He shoots through his right shoulder three times, but still lives. This time he takes the gun to his forehead and cocks the gun. The exterior view of his office is shown again and a gunshot is heard. Back inside, he's still alive. The bullet to the brain didn't kill him. This time he shoots at his heart twice, and that finally kills him. He writhes around for a few seconds and dies.]"
1729,11,7,Randy Marsh,"[rifling through a box] No. No, damn it! [faces the small group on the roof with him] That's it. That's it, everyone. We're out of Pop-Tarts."
1730,11,7,Jimbo Kern,No. We can't be.
1731,11,7,Randy Marsh,"Face it, we're gonna starve!"
1732,11,7,Linda Stotch,"No, no wait, there's still a box over here."
1733,11,7,Randy Marsh,Those are cherry! Ich!
1734,11,7,Head of Public Safety,"[his cell phone rings and he rises] Wait, I got a signal! I got a signal. [dials a number]"
1735,11,7,Gerald Broflovski,What? You do?
1736,11,7,Randy Marsh,How? Call the fire department.
1737,11,7,Head of Public Safety,"I'm calling my wife! [waits for her to pick up] Mary. Mary baby, are you all right?"
1738,11,7,Linda Stotch,"Oh, maybe we're gonna be okay."
1739,11,7,Stephen Stotch,Ask her what's happening.
1740,11,7,Head of Public Safety,"Mary, what's goin' on out there? Nobody's coming for us. They what? No! That's impossible. But how can that be? We didn't even- [the phone cuts out] Hello? Mary. [tries to reconnect] Mary!"
1741,11,7,Jimbo Kern,"What happened, Glen?"
1742,11,7,Glen,"[Head of Public Safety] There's no help coming! She said... because of all the homeless... because of all the homeless in South Park property values have plummeted. I had two liens against my house and so the bank is foreclosing! I don't have a home anymore. [Randy and the others are quiet for a moment, but Randy knows what he must do. He pumps his shotgun and aims at Glen.]"
1743,11,7,Linda Stotch,"Randy, what are you doing?"
1744,11,7,Randy Marsh,He's homeless now. We aren't safe.
1745,11,7,Glen,I'm not like them.
1746,11,7,Randy Marsh,Not yet. It's only a matter of time.
1747,11,7,Linda Stotch,"[tries dissuading Randy] And what are you gonna do, huh? Just blow his head off?"
1748,11,7,Randy Marsh,If we have to! Siddown Glen!
1749,11,7,Glen,"Randy, you can't just-"
1750,11,7,Randy Marsh,SIT... doowwwnnnn!
1751,11,7,Glen,This is crazy. How can they just take away my house? Where am I supposed to put all my things? I don't have a place for all my stuff; where am I supposed to put all my stuff? I'll need to pay for storage. Can I borrow some- money to put my stuff in storage? Come on guys. If you all just help me out a little bit. Each one of you just put in a little... change? Change? [That's it. Randy fires at him and blows the upper half of his head off. Randy sighs heavily]
1752,11,7,Stan Marsh,What the hell happened here? [three men in camouflage appear and aim their shotguns at them]
1753,11,7,Man 1,[wearing a white and blue bandana around his neck] That's far enough! Just march your butts right back out of our town!
1754,11,7,Stan Marsh,"We, just came to ask a question."
1755,11,7,Man 2,You homeless or homeowners?
1756,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,We're nine.
1757,11,7,Man 1,"Yeah? Well that makes you homeless, so get out of here before you die!"
1758,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Look, we just need help with our own homeless problem."
1759,11,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah. This Jew here made them take over our town.
1760,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut up, Cartman!"
1761,11,7,Man 1,Cartman? Eric Cartman? The kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard?
1762,11,7,Eric Cartman,Youu heard about that?
1763,11,7,Man 2,Heard about it? They said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump.
1764,11,7,Eric Cartman,Thirty was hard enough.
1765,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God! It wasn't thirty, it was one! He jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard, and he barely made it over that guy!"
1766,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, knock it off! We're here to find out how to get rid of the homeless, not how many homeless Cartman can jump!"
1767,11,7,Eric Cartman,"Please, we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town."
1768,11,7,Man 2,"Well, that was easy. [the group moves to a clearing where the boys sit on a bench while the first man serves himself some coffee and begins explaining]"
1769,11,7,Man 1,"The homeless first started arriving in Evergreen about three months ago. At first there were only a few of them, askin' for change, sleeping in the parks. But then more showed up, and we realized there was somethin' different about them. They fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments. We knew it wouldn't be long before the homeless actually started buying homes. And then we'd have no idea who was homeless and who wasn't! The people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldn't even know! [sips] Nobody could trust anybody! Fights broke out. War! [Kyle notices something on the ground] That's when I started suspecting that [the something is a pamphlet that says ""HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS"" on the front cover. He picks it up] my own wife, who I'd been living with for twenty years, was actually homeless. So I had to burn her. In her bed while she slept. [Kyle reads the pamphlet] After she died I vowed I wouldn't let the homeless destroy our town! So we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all. [Kyle opens the pamphlet and is met with these words: ""HAVEN FOR THE HOMELESS. TRY SOUTH PARK.""]"
1770,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"You son of a bitch. [gets off the bench and approaches the first man with the pamphlet] You didn't solve your homeless problem, you just sent all your homeless to South Park! [opens the pamphlet to show him]"
1771,11,7,Man 1,"That's right, yes."
1772,11,7,Stan Marsh,What?
1773,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,I knew it! It wasn't because I gave that guy twenty dollars! The homeless all came from here!
1774,11,7,Man 1,And it was Texas who sent them to us! People in San Antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin' them what a great place Evergreen was!
1775,11,7,Stan Marsh,"[getting off the bench] But then you didn't solve the problem, you just moved it!"
1776,11,7,Man 1,Right. But we survived.
1777,11,7,A Woman,"[pops up out of nowhere, almost a skeleton] Dehhhnyihhhs! [she's armed with a rifle and ready to shoot]"
1778,11,7,Dennis from Evergreen,"[Man 1, turns around. The other two men look as well] Christine!"
1779,11,7,Christine from Evergreen,You sonothatitch! You tried to kinn me!
1780,11,7,Dennis from Evergreen,"I had to, Christine, you were homeless."
1781,11,7,Christine from Evergreen,"No, I wasn't honeless yeh stukid asshole!"
1782,11,7,Dennis from Evergreen,"Christine, I can't understand you."
1783,11,7,Christine from Evergreen,Yeah! Gecause you durned my yits oth!
1784,11,7,Dennis from Evergreen,I nurned your rip sauce?
1785,11,7,Christine from Evergreen,No! You durned my yits oth!
1786,11,7,Dennis from Evergreen,"I have no idea what you're saying! [Christine shoots him] Ow! [Dennis is dead. The third man kills Christine, who fires one final shot and hits the second man. The second man kills the third and dies moments later]"
1787,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, our parents are just as stupid as these people, our town is gonna end up just like this!"
1788,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns around] No it isn't. Come on, I have an idea."
1789,11,7,Stan Marsh,"No no, we're not having Cartman jump any more homeless people, Kyle!"
1790,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,That isn't my idea! I saw a bus in a garage a couple of blocks back! We need to modify it!
1791,11,7,Kenny McCormick,(What are you gonna do?)
1792,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,We're gonna save our parents before they all kill each other!
1793,11,7,Randy Marsh,A bus! A bus is coming!
1794,11,7,Jimbo Kern,[seeing who's inside] It's the boys! They've modified a bus to get us out of here!
1795,11,7,Stephen Stotch,I knew they'd come back for us!
1796,11,7,Linda Stotch,All right!
1797,11,7,A Woman,Yeah.
1798,11,7,Randy Marsh,"[props up Glen's corpse so it faces the bus] Look, Glen. We're saved. [the bus stops]"
1799,11,7,Stan Marsh,"All right, I'm turning around"
1800,11,7,Stephen Stotch,Why are they turning?
1801,11,7,Randy Marsh,[drops the corpse] What are they doing? [the bus turns so the front end now faces away from the community center. Randy calls out] Don't leave us!
1802,11,7,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, hit it."
1803,11,7,Eric Cartman,Let's hope to Christ this works. [prepares to press the red button. Music begins to play]
1804,11,7,Backup Singers,California Love[the homeless grow quiet]
1805,11,7,The Boys,California

You can chill if you're homeless.
[the music stops. Three homeless men sleep on the Strand and Cartman sails over them, landing on the third man and skating away]"
1823,11,7,Bum,Eughuhuh.
1824,11,7,Eric Cartman,"[jumps off his skateboard, throws down his helmet and exults] Yes! That's three homeless! Suck on that! Fuck yeah! [faces his friends and the bums]"
1825,11,7,Stan Marsh,"Honestly, I don't know what you see in this, Kyle."
1826,11,8,Eric Cartman,[picks out a figure] Big Ring Slammer. Comes with posable neck-smash grip. [moves the package around with his left hand and strokes his chin with his right] That's pretty kewl. Let's see...
1827,11,8,Teen Boy,Cock! [Cartman is startled.]
1828,11,8,Eric Cartman,[puts the Slammer back on the rack and selects another figure.] The Black Jackal. Karate Kick Panel Force and bendable neck-
1829,11,8,Teen Boy,"Asshole! Cock! Asshole, shit, shit cock! [his neck and face get taut as he blurts this out]"
1830,11,8,Clerk,"[nearby] Ma'am, is that your son over there?"
1831,11,8,Mom,"Yes, I'm sorry. My son has Tourette's Syndrome."
1832,11,8,Clerk,Tourette's Syndrome?
1833,11,8,Mom,It's a neurological disorder. He-he can't control what he says.
1834,11,8,Clerk,Oh...
1835,11,8,Teen Boy,"[turns his head hard to the left, his eyes shut] Shiit! [turns his head back to face forward] Dumb shiiit!"
1836,11,8,Mom,"[goes to take her son home] A-alright Thomas, maybe we should go?"
1837,11,8,Thomas and his mom,All right Mom- Bitch! Ass bitch!
1838,11,8,Mom,"Here, let's buy you a nice toy to take home. [selects a figure and hands it to Thomas, who walks away with her, smiling. Cartman watches as they leave]"
1839,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and walks off, saying softly] Dude, that mom is kewl. [he arrives at the checkout line with his action figure]"
1840,11,8,Thomas and his mom,[stands in line behind Cartman] Cocknut! Augh... Stupid shit!
1841,11,8,Eric Cartman,[turns around and glares at Thomas] Are you talkin' to me?!
1842,11,8,Thomas and his mom,No. Cocknose!
1843,11,8,Eric Cartman,"What's your problem, kid?!"
1844,11,8,Mom,"Oh, a-I'm sorry. [Thomas backs away a bit] My... son Thomas has Tourette's Syndrome. [a crowd begins to gather around them]"
1845,11,8,Eric Cartman,What?
1846,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Mom, let's just go. Shhhit!"
1847,11,8,Mom,People with Tourette's can't control certain tics. It's it's like a sneeze.
1848,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Asshole ASSHOLE.
1849,11,8,Eric Cartman,[waves his arms around] Wait waitwait whoa whoa whoa. You're telling me there's an illness that makes you blurt out obscenities?
1850,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Mom, can we just go home, please?"
1851,11,8,Mom,"It's okay, Thomas. They understand."
1852,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"I want tuh go! [throws down his action figure and walks off, his hands over his mouth] Shitfag!"
1853,11,8,Man 1,Poor kid.
1854,11,8,Clerk,Yeah.
1855,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and faces the crowd] All right, hold on just a second here: Are you telling me that if you have this Tourette's Syndrome you can say whatever you want, all the time, and never get in trouble?"
1856,11,8,Clerk,It's a neurological disorder; he can't help it.
1857,11,8,Man 1,"Yeah! [Cartman blinks - CHING! He begins to think: ""I've got a golden ticket... I've got a golden""]"
1858,11,8,Eric Cartman,Twinkle in my eye. [turns and heads for the entrance] haha. HahaHAAhahahaha. [throws his action figure into the air and runs out the door]
1859,11,8,Clerk,Hey don't you wanna buy that toy?
1860,11,8,Eric Cartman,I don't need the toy! I've found something better! [dances away] 'Cause I've got a golden ticket! I've got a golden chance to make my way!
1861,11,8,Liane Cartman,"It started about four days ago, Doctor, and every day he seems to get worse."
1862,11,8,Eric Cartman,Puh- pussy!
1863,11,8,Liane Cartman,Oh...
1864,11,8,Eric Cartman,Pussy! Cock! Shit! [covers his mouth in faking embarrassment]
1865,11,8,Liane Cartman,"Oh dear... I was checking out the Internet and ih, it almost seems like his symptoms are like those in something called ""Tour, Tourette's Syndrome""?"
1866,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Tourette's Syndrome? What is that, Mommy. Butthole! Titties! Balls! [covers his mouth immediately]"
1867,11,8,Doctor,That doesn't seem likely. Tourette's is a hereditary disease; it doesn't just suddenly start.
1868,11,8,Eric Cartman,...Cocksucker!
1869,11,8,Doctor,"[begins to think and walks off a bit] ...On the other hand, Tourette's does often develop later in a child's life, getting progressively worse."
1870,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh wuh, well that's it! Shithead! Asshole! Mexican sticky balls!"
1871,11,8,Liane Cartman,"Oh Doctor, can you help him?"
1872,11,8,Doctor,[turns around and walks back to them] We don't know very much about Tourette's I'm afraid. But we will give your son all the help we can.
1873,11,8,Eric Cartman,"But what about school, Doctor? The teachers and the principal, they won't understand that I can't control what I say."
1874,11,8,Doctor,"Don't worry, young man. We'll make sure everyone understands your disease and gives you the compassion you deserve."
1875,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Ohohh, that's awesome. Thank you. Faggot! [gives him a mischievous look]"
1876,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Shit! Butthole! [walks up to Wendy] Hey Wendy. DUMB BITCH! Uh, sorry. [smiles and moves on] Titties! Cock! [he's relishing this. He points to a redhead] Ginger retard! Asslicker dickface!"
1877,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you'd better watch it. The principal's right over there. [she walks up to them]"
1878,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, Good morning, Principal Victoria. Shitballs!"
1879,11,8,Principal Victoria,"Good morning, Eric. [turns right and walks away. Cartman walks off in the opposite direction]"
1880,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Did Cartman just say ""shitballs"" to the principal?"
1881,11,8,Butters Stotch,"Huhyou didn't hear? Well Cartman has some, mental disease called Tourette's Syndrome or somethin'."
1882,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1883,11,8,Craig Tucker,"[in admiration] He's the luckiest kid in the world. If I could say ""shitballs"" to the principal I'd be sooo happy."
1884,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[deciding to explain things. Mr. Mackey is in the background] Uh excuse me, excuse me everyone I, I guess you might have noticed my awkward tics. Asshole! Pussy asshole! [the other kids lean away] Ach, augh, I just want you to know that I can't control it."
1885,11,8,Principal Victoria,"It's okay, Eric. We all understand and we think you're very brave."
1886,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[after some thought, points and says] He's faking."
1887,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[his thunder is stolen and he covers for it] Ahahahaha, ayah- Excuse me everyone, I need to have a moment alone with my good friend Kyle? [walks to Kyle] Asscheeks! [hauls Kyle off to a clearing] Kyle, apparently you missed the school assembly yesterday, but I've been diagnosed with a very serious mental condition."
1888,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You do not have Tourette's Syndrome, fatass!"
1889,11,8,Eric Cartman,"...Oh, okay, you figured me out. [claps] Bravo, Kyle, bravo. Don't you see how awesome this is? It's like, a magic cloak that makes me impervious to getting in trouble."
1890,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,Who cares about saying whatever you-?
1891,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Of course, if you want to be Sergeant Buzzkill once again, and spoil my fun because you're jealous you didn't think of it first, well go right ahead, Kyle."
1892,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Grrhh, whatever. [walks off in a huff. Mr. Mackey walks by]"
1893,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Good morning, Mr. Mackey. Asspussy! [Mr. Mackey does nothing but walk away]"
1894,11,8,Craig Tucker,"If I could say ""asspussy"" to the counselor I would be sooo happy."
1895,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, so what do we get when we multiply a negative number-?"
1896,11,8,Eric Cartman,Dicktits!
1897,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"[glances back at Cartman, then finishes writing] -when we multiply a negative number by another negative-?"
1898,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Shit! Asshole! [Mrs. Garrison looks at Cartman with a bit of shock, then turns to the board.] 'Scuse me. [Cartman smiles]"
1899,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"Ih if we apply what we've just learned, we see that all negatives can-"
1900,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Spooge, balls, bloody... vaginal... belch! [the class laughs. Cartman pretends to be hurt] You guys, don't laugh. It makes me feel insecure about my illness."
1901,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"[facing the class] All right kids, let's just try to focus on learning, okay? [turns to the board] Now all you need to remember here is that negative numbers"
1902,11,8,Eric Cartman,Tampon! Tampon DICKshit!
1903,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,Will you knock it off already?!
1904,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, don't you think I wish I could? I'd give anything to be normal like you. KIKE."
1905,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't push me, asshole!"
1906,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"Kyle, watch your language! [Cartman lets out a hearty laugh]"
1907,11,8,Craig Tucker,"[getting miserable] If I could yell ""tampon dickshit"" in the classroom I'd be sooo happy."
1908,11,8,Mrs Garrison,"Principal Victoria, it's just that Eric has become such a distraction I, I don't think I can teach my class anymore."
1909,11,8,Principal Victoria,"I understand it's been difficult, Mrs. Garrison, and so, Mr. Donaldson has come from the Tourette's Tolerance and Understanding Foundation. [Mr. Donaldson walks into view]"
1910,11,8,Mr Donaldson,Hello Mrs. Garrison- [turns his head to the left] Ass. ASS. [recovers] I want to help your class better understand this illness. [turns his head to the left] Piss!
1911,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks into the office, with Cartman following] No! Up yours, fatboy!"
1912,11,8,Eric Cartman,Kyle please! I'm sorry!
1913,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Principal Victoria, there's something you need to know! Cartman's Tourette's isn't real! He's faking!"
1914,11,8,Mr Donaldson,Faking? [Kyle is sure he's got Cartman on the hook] You think people with Tourette's are faking?!
1915,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[his certainty gone] N-no, I'm just saying that I think-"
1916,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Do you have any idea how horrible that is to say? [turns his head to the left] Ass! ASS! [recovers] We aren't ""faking"", young man. Trust me, nobody wants this illness, ass. [turns his head to the left] PISS! PIIISS!"
1917,11,8,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Kyle. [turns his head to the left, where Kyle happens to be] Crap-filled vagina!"
1918,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"This is the kind of intolerance you teach at this school, Principal Victoria?!"
1919,11,8,Principal Victoria,No.
1920,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"This if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to take this ""bully"" to see that Tourette's is very real. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss."
1921,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Kids, today during therapy class we have a special visitor. [turns his head to the right, where Kyle happens to be. Kyle jumps in his chair] ASS! [recovers and clears his throat] I, I wanted him to meet all of you so he could try to understand Tourette's"
1922,11,8,Teen Boy,Tourette's is like a cough or a sneeze. [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrr! [recovers] It isn't contagious like some people think. [shakes his head quickly] Brrrrrrrrr!
1923,11,8,Blonde Girl,"A lot of people with Tourette's have different tics. My tic [leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers] is that I have to bend my neck and snap her fingers. But a lot of people don't even notice it. [leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]"
1924,11,8,Thomas and his mom,[turns his head to the right] Aw shit! COCK!
1925,11,8,Brunette,"Sometimes it can be embarrassing to have Tourette's, but I [blinks and bobs her head] Boop. I've learned I shouldn't be mad at myself."
1926,11,8,Mr Donaldson,You see? These kids can't control their actions. Ass! Piss in the ass!
1927,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"L-look, I was just suggesting that maybe this one person could control what he said, but just didn't, for fun."
1928,11,8,Teen Boy,"Fun? [shakes her head quickly] Brrrrr! [recovers] This really isn't all that fun. [shakes her head quickly] Brrr, brrrrrr!"
1929,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Aw shit!
1930,11,8,Brunette,"[blinks and bobs her head] Boop. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]"
1931,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"[turns his head to the left] Piiiss, coming from my aaass!"
1932,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Yee-you wanna know about fun? Going to public places knowing you're going to make a fool of yourself. Embarrass your parents [turns his head to the right] Aw shit! [recovers] My dad... finally couldn't take it anymore. He... divorced my mom, s-said he'd still be around, but I only see him at Christmastime now. S-sh-shit! S-sh-shit! The worst part is I know how lonely my mom is. A lot of times I know she'd be better off if I was dead."
1933,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,Dude...
1934,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Your mom would not be better off if you were dead, Thomas. Even if people like Kyle here think so."
1935,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, come on!"
1936,11,8,Mr Donaldson,So then you apologize for what you said before?
1937,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah I was just trying to... just, just in one instance... No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [The blonde girl leans her head to the left, straightens it out, and snaps her fingers]"
1938,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Well, Mr. and Ms. Broflovski, I think your son has learned a lot, and he appears to be honestly remorseful for making fun of people with disabilities. [turns his head to the left] Piss! PISS!"
1939,11,8,Sheila Broflovski,Our son is a good kid. He just didn't understand Tourette's was a real disease.
1940,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"Well, I think the only thing left now is for your son to apologize to his little classmate. [Cartman walks into view and bats his eyes at Kyle sweetly. Kyle does not appreciate this]"
1941,11,8,Gerald Broflovski,Well Kyle?
1942,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,[grudgingly] I'm sorry.
1943,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, what was that? I I couldn't quite make that out, Kyle."
1944,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[grudgingly, louder] I'm sorry."
1945,11,8,Eric Cartman,"You're starry? I I don't get what you mean by that, Kyle. You're starry because uh I don't want it?"
1946,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I said I'm sorry, you piece of sh- [stops himself]"
1947,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, oh, no, don't worry about it, Kyle. Now I understand. I've learned to deal with intolerance. Dumbshit douche bag! And it means a lot that you're standing here apologizing with your dad and lovely mother. [looks at Gerald and Sheila] Fat Jew! Jew bitch!"
1948,11,8,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, thank you Eric."
1949,11,8,Eric Cartman,Thank you. Big-nosed kike! [Sheila laughs nervously]
1950,11,8,Mr Donaldson,Well I think we can all put this behind us now. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss out my aaass!
1951,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah. Piss out your ass right onto Kyle's mom's fat fucking Jew face! [thumps his chest and clears his throat] Oh goodness, 'scuse me. Jeez, that was a bad one. [starts to walk away] Well, gotta run, everybody. Got some big things in the works. [stops to whisper to Thomas] Isn't having Tourette's awesome? [leaves]"
1952,11,8,Announcer,Next week on Dateline NBC: it's a Dateline special report.
1953,11,8,Chris Hansen,"I'm Chris Hansen. You probably know me from To Catch A Predator, where we bust men looking for sex with children."
1954,11,8,Chris Hansen,Go ahead and take a seat. Take a seat right over there.
1955,11,8,Predator,"Oh God, Whoa no."
1956,11,8,Chris Hansen,What are you doin' here?
1957,11,8,Predator,"I'm just' bein' stupid, I guess."
1958,11,8,Chris Hansen,But now we're switching our focus from pedophiles to Tourette's Syndrome. It all started when I received this touching letter from a brave little boy in Colorado.
1959,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[doing a voice-over]
Dear Mr. Hansen, 
I have Tourettes and I want the world to understand what it's like. Won't you do a special report on me so that the world can learn to ACCEPT us instead of just laugh? Donkey Boner!!! 
Eric Cartman


[he doesn't say his name]"
1960,11,8,Chris Hansen,"This Saturday on Dateline I'll be bringing you Eric's story, live and uncensored, from his home in Colorado."
1961,11,8,Announcer,Living with Tourette's: The Eric Cartman Story. This Saturday on Dateline NBC.
1962,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[adding to the commercial] Finally, my wish of going public with my illness can come true. [jumps at the camera] Goddamn Jews! Suck my ass barf! [jumps back in shock, covers his mouth, then smiles at the camera sweetly, bending his head to the right]"
1963,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Dickhead!"
1964,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,What's this about you going on live television on Saturday?!
1965,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[serves himself some liquid] Yes. It's all finally come to fruition. [gently swirls the ice around] The final cog in my... master plan. [turns around to face Kyle] This Saturday I will go on national television, live. I will say ...horrible things on the air. [turns back and prepares a drink for Kyle] Despicable things. And people will call me brave."
1966,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, there are people in the world who really have Tourette's Syndrome. This isn't funny!"
1967,11,8,Eric Cartman,[takes the drink to Kyle] Not funny? I have free rein to say anything I want and you get into trouble if you try and stop me. Care for a Scotch?
1968,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,...Scotch?
1969,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[quickly gives him the drink in triumph] Kyle I've won! No matter how you look at it! I've managed not only to get away with saying whatever I want at school, on the bus, at the dinner table, but this Saturday I will actually say anything I want... on national television. I'm going to blast the Jews, Kyle. I'm going to call them every name in the book, and people will call it brilliant television. They'll probably give me an Emmy."
1970,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"You are not going to go on national television and spew a bunch of hate speech about Jewish people! I won't let you do it, Cartman!"
1971,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Then the game is on, Kyle."
1972,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's not a game, you derelict! And this isn't Scotch! It's apple juice! [Cartman looks at his drink]"
1973,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[walks back to make another ""Scotch""] Do you have any idea how liberating it is to say whatever comes to mind? ""Big titties! Buttmunch!"" There's no walls anymore! ""Shit!"" Whatever enters my brain I can just say without thinking about it. ""I wet my bed last night."" [realizes what just happened]"
1974,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,What did you say?
1975,11,8,Eric Cartman,Uhh nuh-nothing...
1976,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,You aren't gonna get away with this you stupid asshole! [runs out of the room and slams the door]
1977,11,8,Eric Cartman,Hm. That was... weird.
1978,11,8,Mr Donaldson,"We are here today to congratulate a brave little boy. Tonight, Eric Cartman will go on television and become the spokesman for Tourette's Syndrome. [turns his head to the left] Piiiss out my aaass! [applause rises from the crowd]"
1979,11,8,Thomas and his mom,The spokesman for Tourette's? Oh no... [turns his head to the right] Cock!
1980,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[Mr. Donaldson adjusts the mic to his height] Thanks, everybody. Suck my balls! [applause rises from the crowd] You've all been so understanding and supportive of my illness. Jizz farmer dick sneeze. And it is because of you... that I have the courage to go on national television tonight. Titty sprinkles. [applause rises from the crowd]"
1981,11,8,Craig Tucker,"If I could say ""titty sprinkles"" on national television I would be sooo happy."
1982,11,8,Eric Cartman,"And I also just want to say that... I'm making this all up! [startled by his own words, then covers his mouth as the crowd falls silent.] Uh, I... I...'m making this all up to you, for putting up with my mental disorder. I cry at night because I don't have a dad. [turns away from the mic and mumbles] What the hell is going on?"
1983,11,8,Mr Mackey,"Uhit's okay, Eric. We understand your illness, m'kay?"
1984,11,8,Eric Cartman,"No hey ut what, what I meant to say was ""asslicker cumballs."" And uhh, [helplessly] I'm secretly in love with Patty Nelson. I fantasize about kissing Patty Nelson! [covers his mouth]"
1985,11,8,Patty Nelson,Eewwww!
1986,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[clambors offstage] Uhuh, excuse me I, I need a toilet! Bathroom! Bathroom! [runs through the crowd]"
1987,11,8,Butters Stotch,[does a double take and smiles] Uh hey Eric!
1988,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[finishes up and looks at Butters] Butters, do you think it's possible that you can lose the ability to filter what you say? I mean, if somebody got used to saying whatever came to their mind, could they start saying things that they would normally never say?"
1989,11,8,Butters Stotch,Wuh who are you talking about?
1990,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh, my cousin. My cousin one time my cousin and I touched wieners. [he covers his mouth in horror as Butters is stunned] Wah! [faces Butters]"
1991,11,8,Butters Stotch,You... you and your cousin touched wieners?
1992,11,8,Eric Cartman,I didn't say that YES I DID BUT WHY? Oh! Stop it! [runs out of the restroom]
1993,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Excuse me! Excuse me, I need to go! I gotta run!"
1994,11,8,Liane Cartman,"Is there a problem, sweetie?"
1995,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[turns around and faces her] No, no problem. I just need to- my cousin and I touched each other's [struggles to keep control] AAAA no, NAAAA! [he's got the crowd's attention] I just... no I... I just want to thank everyone for coming- my cousin and I touched wiener- we wiener we, weenter! Winter is a cold time of year. [now composed] Ah, I need to be going now."
1996,11,8,Mr Mackey,Well all right Eric. Well good luck on Dateline tonight.
1997,11,8,Eric Cartman,[apprehensive] Dateline. Right. [backs away but can't control his statements] I wet my b-AAA! I touched my cousin's WEE-NUH! This sure has been fun! G'bye! [runs out the door with his hands firmly over his mouth]
1998,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrooome. I'm Chris Hansen. Mmh. I'm Chris Hansen."
1999,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[rushes onto the set] Ah, Mr. Hansen? I'm afraid I can't do the show."
2000,11,8,Chris Hansen,Why not?
2001,11,8,Eric Cartman,"My uh, my grandma just died, so I have to go to Memphis- That's not true. My grandma's fine."
2002,11,8,Chris Hansen,[rolls up his notes and motions Cartman to a stool] Why don't you have a seat?
2003,11,8,Eric Cartman,No I just need to get home. I'm not doin' the show.
2004,11,8,Chris Hansen,Go ahead and take a seat.
2005,11,8,Eric Cartman,[heads for the door] But I'm not gonna do the-
2006,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Take a seat, right over there. [Cartman backs up and sits on the stool, then puts his cap on the bar] What are you doing here?"
2007,11,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm, I'm telling you that I'm not doing the show?"
2008,11,8,Chris Hansen,But you are doing the show.
2009,11,8,Eric Cartman,"You don't understand! All of a sudden, I can't control what I say."
2010,11,8,Chris Hansen,Well of course you can't control what you say. You have Tourehhtte's.
2011,11,8,Eric Cartman,"No! My Tourette's has gotten worse! Before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff. But now it's gotten really bad. [gets his cap and puts it on] So ah I'm sorry, but I'm not doin' the show, that's it. Goodbye. [hops off the stool and walks away]"
2012,11,8,Chris Hansen,Why don't you take a seat?
2013,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I don't wanna take a seat!"
2014,11,8,Chris Hansen,Have a seat.
2015,11,8,Eric Cartman,"[begins backing up] No, I'm just gonna go- [wonders how this is happening]"
2016,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Take a seat, right over there."
2017,11,8,Eric Cartman,[gets back on the stool and whispers to himself] How does he do that?
2018,11,8,Chris Hansen,"You know, one tiiime, I was doin' a show called ""To Catch A Predator"". We almost caught this pedophile, but then he raaan from us 'cause he didn't wanna be on Dateline. Se we tracked him down to his hoouuse. And you know what he did? He shot himself. [Cartman is scared] It'd be a shame if... you didn't wanna go on Dateline. Be a shame if we had to track you down and you ""shot yourself"". [Cartman is more scared, and a series of expressions cross his face]"
2019,11,8,Announcer,"Live, from our satellite studio in Colorado. This! ...is Dateline."
2020,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Tonight, an inside look at Tourette's Syndrome. I'm [stretches his name out so it sounds like nails on a chalkboard] Chris Hansen. In a few minutes, you will meet little Eric Cartman, who wants the world to understand his affliction."
2021,11,8,A Page,"Five minutes, kid."
2022,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Jesus Christ. How did I get myself into this? [walks to a nearby table and begins to pray] God? Please uh, I know I screwed up. I should have never pretended to have Tourette's Syndrome, but see, ah I get it now. You can't just walk around saying whatever you want. You gave us a filter because, people don't wanna hear things like ""I touched penises with my cousin!"" [covers his mouth quickly] Ahaab, ahaabuh. And, and I learned, you especially can't say whatever you want on national television, 'cause, there could be kids watching. Please, God, don't make me embarrass myself on national television. You... must see how this is all somewhat your fault, right? Please, I need a miracle."
2023,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Tango, this is Foxtrot. Are you in position?"
2024,11,8,Thomas and his mom,[using a walkie talkie] Copy Foxtrot. Tango in position. Awww shit!
2025,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,You sure you don't wanna back out?
2026,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Nono, you were right. The fat kid is faking it! If he goes on TV, more people will think that having Tourette's is fun. Asshole shit!"
2027,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, then we go with the plan. Just like ""To Catch A Predator"". [a light brown car pulls in] The first guy is here. This is probably HotForBoys219. [the car stops and Thomas looks around]"
2028,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"[walks up to Thomas] Hi, are you CuteBilly182?"
2029,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Yeah. I was chatting with you online. SHIT!
2030,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"[shaking with excitement] Oh God, I'm so turned on right now. This is your house? Your, your parents aren't home, are they?"
2031,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"N-no, it's cool. Go on inside. I made brownies. SHIT! I'm just gonna slip into something more comf'table. COCK!"
2032,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,[dances by] Okay. Cock! Don't take too long. [laughs and prances into the studio]
2033,11,8,Chris Hansen,"So now let's meet a child who haaas Tourette's Syndrooome, and who must fi- [the audience doors open and HotForBoys219 prances down the aisle laughing]"
2034,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"Ho, whoa, wait a minute. This ain't no house."
2035,11,8,Chris Hansen,[stands up angrily] What are you doing?!
2036,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"[gasps and hides his face] Chris Hansen?! Oh no, it's a setup! I knew it!"
2037,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Sir, why don't you take a seat, right over there."
2038,11,8,HotForBoys219 and other pedophiles,"Now everyone's gonna know I'm a perv! Whoa! [takes out a gun and shoots himself in the head. Nearby audience members move away, and the audience gets restless]"
2039,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Aw, not again."
2040,11,8,Eric Cartman,Kyle?
2041,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Surprise, fatass!"
2042,11,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, what are you doing?"
2043,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I went online posing as a boy who would have sex with older men, and told them to meet me here. My plan worked perfectly! [car horns blare outside, and Kyle goes to take a look. The parking lot quickly fills up as drivers park and leave their cars.] Whoa."
2044,11,8,Pedo 2,"[walks up to Thomas and waves a Wendy's bag in front of him] Hey, I brought you some Wendy's."
2045,11,8,Thomas and his mom,"Yeah yeah, go on in. There's a hot tub inside. STUPID SHIT!"
2046,11,8,Pedo 2,Score! [goes inside]
2047,11,8,Pedo 2,"Oh no, it's Chris Hansen! [drops his meal and shoots himself]"
2048,11,8,Audience Members,Whoa! Who is that? What's going on?
2049,11,8,Chris Hansen,What the hell is going on?!
2050,11,8,Pedo 3,"Wait a minute. Oh God, it's Chris Hansen! [shoots himself]"
2051,11,8,Pedo 4,Chris Hansen! [shoots himself]
2052,11,8,Pedo 5,Dateline?! [shoots himself]
2053,11,8,Pedo 6,I knew it! [shoots himself]
2054,11,8,Pedo 7,"There aren't really brownies! [shoots himself. More pedophiles enter and kill themselves, and the audience begins rushing out of the studio]"
2055,11,8,Chris Hansen,Hey! Do you have something to do with this? Answer meee!
2056,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Stupid shit! Cock! [more audience members rush by]
2057,11,8,Chris Hansen,"What?! Nobody talks to me like that! Why don't you take a seat? Take a seat, right over there."
2058,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Suck it! Asshole licker dickfart!
2059,11,8,Chris Hansen,"Fine, you lil- I'll, I'll tell on you! [leaves, and there are no other adults left]"
2060,11,8,Craig Tucker,"[walks up to Thomas] Wow, you're the coolest kid in the world. If I could call Chris Hansen an asshole-licking dickfart to his face, I would be sooo happy."
2061,11,8,Thomas and his mom,You would?
2062,11,8,Craig Tucker,"Could I just like, hang out with you sometime? Like, do your laundry maybe?"
2063,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[feeling triumphant] Take a look, fatass! I beat you! You aren't going on Dateline; what have you got to say now?! [Cartman is silent for a moment, then hugs Kyle and sobs. Kyle wasn't expecting this]"
2064,11,8,Eric Cartman,Oh thank you! Thank you Kyle!
2065,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,What?
2066,11,8,Eric Cartman,"I asked God to send someone to help me, and you came, Kyle! I love you man!"
2067,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I- I beat you!"
2068,11,8,Eric Cartman,"You totally saved my ass, Kyle. You must... really care about me. See you Kyle! I gotta get to a psychiatrist and learn to control what I say! [heads up the aisle and out of the studio] I got a golden ticket! Thanks to Kyle! I got a golden twinkle in my eye! [Kyle is alone on set, but Thomas comes up and stands next to him]"
2069,11,8,Thomas and his mom,Aww shit!
2070,11,8,Kyle Broflovski,Aww shit!
2071,11,9,Dr Doctor,"Well, there's no doubt in my mind, Mr. Marsh. You are constipated. [walks over to a table]"
2072,11,9,Randy Marsh,[quite aware] Thanks for the news flash! I haven't taken a crap in over three weeks! The question is why?!
2073,11,9,Dr Doctor,"Well, what food have you been eating?"
2074,11,9,Randy Marsh,"P.F. Chang's, mostly. [rubs his belly] Good stuff."
2075,11,9,Dr Doctor,"I'm going to prescribe a laxative. [writes out the prescription and turns around] But I must warn you: when you do finally pass this stool, it might be very painful."
2076,11,9,Randy Marsh,"How painful is ""painful""?"
2077,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh God. Oh, here it comes. [he goes for the final push, which has him pushing himself off the toilet seat by his hands several times. A few seconds later, the banner and award disappear] Whoa, hot! Hot hot! Whoaaa hot hot hot hot hot! [a view from the street. Randy's moans can be heard as he can be seen moving about] Whoa, whoaaa! Whoa hot! Hot hot hothothothot hot hot! [back in the bathroom. The stool finally comes out] Dohhhhhhhhhh! Oooh! Oohoo. [begins to sob from relief] Ohhh, it's over. It's over. [reaches for the toilet paper to wipe his ass clean] Oh God. [puts his briefs and pants back up in place] I feel so much better. Oh. [a view from within the toilet: Randy turns around to flush, but stops, looks down, and crouches down for a better look] Wow... That... is huge. That has got to be the biggest crap I've ever taken. He-... Hey Sharon. Sharon you gotta come see this. Sha-Sharon?"
2078,11,9,Sharon Marsh,"[opens the door and enters] What is it, Randy? Do you have any- [looks in the toilet] OH! [squeezes her eyes closed and covers her nose with her right arm] Randy!"
2079,11,9,Randy Marsh,Will you look at that? Is that the biggest crap you've ever seen or what?
2080,11,9,Sharon Marsh,[a view from behind the toilet] Flush the toilet for Christ's sake!
2081,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Come on! That's pretty impressive! [Stan wanders in from the hall, and Stan calls him] Wha-hey Stan! Stan, look at this. [Stan walks closer to the toilet]"
2082,11,9,Sharon Marsh,Randy!
2083,11,9,Randy Marsh,[on bended knee next to Stan] Look what your old man made.
2084,11,9,Stan Marsh,No way!
2085,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Huh? Never seen one that big, have you?"
2086,11,9,Stan Marsh,"No, never."
2087,11,9,Shelly Marsh,"[wanders in] Gross, Dad, sick! [turns around quick and leaves]"
2088,11,9,Sharon Marsh,"All right, will you flush the toilet now?! [crosses her arms]"
2089,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[rises and leans over to flush the toilet. Stan steps out of he way] I'll try, but I don't think- [stand straight again] wait wait wait wait a minute. I gotta call Jimbo first."
2090,11,9,Sharon Marsh,Why?!
2091,11,9,Randy Marsh,Well he's gotta see this.
2092,11,9,Sharon Marsh,"No, we are flushing the toilet right now-"
2093,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[turns around and blocks any access to the toilet] No! Jimbo has to see it so when I tell the guys how big it was, they'll know I'm not lying!"
2094,11,9,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, for the love of God, Randy! [turns left and leaves]"
2095,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Sharon, this is important! Stan, go call your Uncle Jimbo. I'm gonna stand guard. [spreads his left and hunches down in a defensive position]"
2096,11,9,Randy Marsh,Hey guys!
2097,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,Hey Randy.
2098,11,9,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, hey Randy."
2099,11,9,Stuart McCormick,Are you feelin' better?
2100,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I-naw, I'm totally fine now."
2101,11,9,Jimbo Kern,"You guys shoulda seen the crap Randy took last night! It was honestly, the biggest crap anyone has ever taken. Ever."
2102,11,9,Randy Marsh,[being modest] Well I don't know about ever...
2103,11,9,Randy Marsh,I'm tellin' you this thing was the size of a freakin' football.
2104,11,9,Randy Marsh,[being modest] I guess it was pretty big.
2105,11,9,Stuart McCormick,A football? That's amazing.
2106,11,9,Stephen Stotch,I've never heard of one that big.
2107,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[chuckles] Oh, my brother took a crap once, that was enormous. It was the biggest in the history of the world, I think. [laughs. The other guys laugh, but Randy shuts up and looks around]"
2108,11,9,Randy Marsh,[softly] It wasn't bigger than mine was.
2109,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh no, seriously, this crap was a monster! [laughs. The other guys join in]"
2110,11,9,Randy Marsh,[softly] Mine... mine was bigger.
2111,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,I doubt it. [snicker]
2112,11,9,Randy Marsh,[looks around] You wanna see it?
2113,11,9,Stuart McCormick,Oh my freaking Lord.
2114,11,9,Skeeter,That did not seriously come out of your ass.
2115,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh yes, it did. Go ahead and check it for splits. It's one solid piece."
2116,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,Jesus...
2117,11,9,Stan Marsh,"[feeling vindicated] That uh, a little bigger than your brother's there, Gerald?"
2118,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,It's... other-worldly.
2119,11,9,Stephen Stotch,"Randy, have you called the people from the Guinness Book of World Records? I mean, this might seriously be the biggest crap in history!"
2120,11,9,Randy Marsh,[gets out a spray can of water] That's why I gotta make sure to keep it safe. [spritzes the poop so it doesn't dry up and crack apart under the two lights it's under]
2121,11,9,Sharon Marsh,[at the doorway] Randy Marsh!
2122,11,9,Randy Marsh,[quickly hides everything under the wraps] Aw crap!
2123,11,9,Sharon Marsh,What the hell do you think you're doing keeping that thing in our house?!
2124,11,9,Randy Marsh,"The guys agree, Sharon: it could be a record holder."
2125,11,9,Sharon Marsh,Why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is?!
2126,11,9,Secretary,"Guinness World Records America. How can I help you? [listens while typing with the right hand, then stops altogether] The biggest crap? We actually don't keep track of that record, sir. [listens] Because we don't want to. [listens] Look, we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap, and we simply can't handle all the measuring and verification. [listens] You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. [listens] You're welcome. [hangs up and resumes typing] Jeez, another one. [the phone rings again and she picks up] Guinness World Records America."
2127,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[gets through. The other guys stand by the sofa] Uhh yes, hello. My name is Randy Marsh, and I believe I took the world's biggest crap. [holds a thumbs up. The other guys do as well]"
2128,11,9,Secretary,"[long sigh, then flatly] You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their Web site."
2129,11,9,Chubby Official,"[hands a manila envelope to a balding gray-haired man] Herr President, take a look at this. [the president opens the envelope and looks at a picture within it] It is a crap sent to us from the United States."
2130,11,9,EFSM President,Very niiice. [it's a picture of Randy measuring the crap with a measuring tape and grinning at the camera] Has it been checked for accuracy?
2131,11,9,Chubby Official,"It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo. We estimate that the crap is over eight and a half Courics!"
2132,11,9,EFSM President,[serious] We'd better get on a plane. Right away. [smiles]
2133,11,9,EFSM President,"Hm, enshnusen?"
2134,11,9,Chubby Official,Verron snusunarich.
2135,11,9,EFSM President,"What was your primary diet for this poo, Mr. Marsh?"
2136,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Uhh, mostly P.F. Chang's. General Tso's Chicken... Oh and uh, and a lot of uh Aunt Jemima's Frozen Sausage Biscuits in the morning."
2137,11,9,Chubby Official,I believe I detect some cabbage as well?
2138,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Ohh yes, I had a lot of kim chee."
2139,11,9,Sharon Marsh,[at the doorway] You have got to be kidding me.
2140,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[turns around and marches towards her] These guys are from Zurich, Sharon! They're Europeans! [the EFSM President joins Randy]"
2141,11,9,EFSM President,"It is a tremendous crap, Mr. Marsh."
2142,11,9,Sharon Marsh,For the love of God!
2143,11,9,EFSM President,Your crap officially weighs... 8.6 Courics
2144,11,9,Randy Marsh,Courics...
2145,11,9,Chubby Official,The standard measuring unit for human feces. One Katie Couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement.
2146,11,9,EFSM President,The current record is a crap weighing 7.5 Courics.
2147,11,9,Randy Marsh,But that means...
2148,11,9,Third Official,That's right. You are the new world's champion!
2149,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Really?! Yuh, you mean, REALLY?! [jumps for joy] Hey Stan! I uh- Hey Sharon! Hey everybody! [walks off]"
2150,11,9,EFSM President,"Well, I guess we'd better call the old champion and let him know his record has just been broken."
2151,11,9,M C,"He has won twenty-two Grammy's, countless humanitarian awards, and is the only person ever to be nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Nobel Peace Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, Bono! [fanfare goes up amid applause. Bono rises from his seat on stage and struts over to the mic. He grabs the award from the M.C., kisses his left index and middle fingers, and throws the kiss off to the audience]"
2152,11,9,Bono,[wearing a fancy straw cowboy hat] Thank you. Thank you so much for this newest award; it means so much. [a phone rings and he looks around] Oh. Excuse me. I must be getting another award. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out a cell phone. He answers it] Yes?
2153,11,9,EFSM President,"Yes, Bono, sir, we wish to inform you that your record for biggest crap has just been broken."
2154,11,9,Bono,What?! That's impossible! How big was it?
2155,11,9,Senator,"We are here to honor the first American to bring home the distinguished EFSM medal for biggest crap ever taken. [applause. The Marshes are present. Randy is decked out in garlands. Sharon looks quite embarrassed. Jimbo, Gerald, Stephen, Stuart, and Skeeter are behind them]"
2156,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Hey look, Sharon, it's the President! He-hey Sharon!"
2157,11,9,Senator,"To present the award I give you the dean of the EFSM, Sir Orloff Broloff. [makes way for the dean, who is also the president]"
2158,11,9,Broloff,"Thank you, Senator. For over a hundred years, the European Fecal Standards and Meas-"
2159,11,9,Chubby Official,Herr Broloff! Herr Broloff! [whispers into his ear]
2160,11,9,Broloff,"Das shpoitenhoff? [to the crowd] Ahhh ladies and gentlemen, I understand we have just received a special video-taped announcement from Bono!"
2161,11,9,People in Crowd,Oh! Bono? Cool!
2162,11,9,Broloff,"Could we play the tape on the big screen, please?"
2163,11,9,Bono,"Hello everyone! I, am Bono. [""BONO"" flashes on the screen a few times, then a short montage of pics follows. ""Hello, hello, helloooo Yeah yeah yeah yeah."" ""BONO"" flashes on the screen a few times more, then he speaks] For years it has been my honor to try and bring focus to the needs in Africa, and today, I have very exciting news. Last night, at twenty past eight, I took a crap weighing nine and a half Courics."
2164,11,9,Crowd,Whoa!
2165,11,9,Sharon Marsh,[lifts her head up] Bono?! [a shot of the monster appears next to a Grammy award for comparison - the Grammy looks like a toy]
2166,11,9,Bono,"As you can see, it is one solid piece. [another shot of him adoring his massive crap on a cushion flanked by two Grammys] It is my biggest crap to date, and I swear to its authenticity. Thank you, and God bless. [an exiting montage follows, and the screens turn off]"
2167,11,9,Broloff,"You heard it, ladies and gentlemen! The official biggest crap is... 9.5 Courics! Congratulations to Bono! [fanfare goes up amid applause]"
2168,11,9,Man,Bo-no! Woo-ooo!
2169,11,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad, um, I think dinner's almost ready."
2170,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[from the heart] I almost did it. I almost made something of myself. You know, when you get real close, you start thinking that maybe your life is gonna matter. [sobs some more] I mean, this was something I made! Something that came from me! That was a part of me! The only thing I ever made that was any good!"
2171,11,9,Stan Marsh,"Gee, thanks a lot, Dad."
2172,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[instinctively replies] You're welcome. [continues] And I just,.. I know that this late in my life I'll never come so close to finally having ...meaning."
2173,11,9,Sharon Marsh,"Come on guys, lasagna's ready."
2174,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[angrily] Oh. Lasagna's ready. [turns around] You hear that, Stan? Mom says lasagna... is ready! I can see through your sarcasm, Sharon!"
2175,11,9,Sharon Marsh,What are you talking about?
2176,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to her] You can say it, Sharon! I know Bono's better than me! I'm sorry I'm not Bono, all right?! Sorry that I don't have... billions of dollars and a Nobel prize nomination!"
2177,11,9,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, this is ridiculous!"
2178,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[offended] Oh, that's real mature, Sharon! Just act like everything's funny! It's a big joke to you, isn't it?! Just a big joke! [Sharon avoids eye contact] Don't touch me! [pulls away a bit, then goes back inside the house]"
2179,11,9,Sharon Marsh,[to Stan] Can you believe him?! All this over what guy took the biggest crap!
2180,11,9,Stan Marsh,"You don't understand, Mom. You just don't understand. [turns around and walks in]"
2181,11,9,Sharon Marsh,Wha? Wha?
2182,11,9,Jimbo Kern,How come they just let that Bono guy send a picture of his crap?
2183,11,9,Stuart McCormick,"'Cause he's Bono, that's why."
2184,11,9,Stephen Stotch,But he could have faked it. It isn't fair!
2185,11,9,Randy Marsh,Doesn't matter. He's got the record now; there's nothing I can do.
2186,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,[slams his fist on the counter] Oh yes there is! You could do it again!
2187,11,9,Randy Marsh,[incredulous] What?
2188,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,Think about it: you weren't even trying to take the biggest crap last time. Imagine if you actually worked at it!
2189,11,9,Stephen Stotch,[getting enthusiastic] Hey. Hey that's right.
2190,11,9,Randy Marsh,Nooo. I can't go through all that again. It's too much.
2191,11,9,Skeeter,"Come on, Randy. I'll bet you can crap that big again easy!"
2192,11,9,Stuart McCormick,"With the right diet and training, who knows what you're capable of?"
2193,11,9,Randy Marsh,"[rises and heads for the door] Guys, forget it! It's over! It was a fluke crap; I'll never take one that big again!"
2194,11,9,Stephen Stotch,"Is it over, Randy?! We all saw that crap you took! That was no fluke! There's something inside you that made you able to do it! Randy, you have a gift. Now who knows why God chose you, but he did! And if you walk away now, you'll always... wonder... how big a crap you could have taken!"
2195,11,9,Randy Marsh,[with some resignation] I would need a lot of help.
2196,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,That's what we're here for.
2197,11,9,Jimbo Kern,"Come on, Randy, what do you say?!"
2198,11,9,Randy Marsh,"I say... [turns around] Let's give Bono a run for his money! [the other men are glad to hear this, so they mob him and talk about it] Yeah!! [shakes his head like a lion] YYEEAAHHHH!"
2199,11,9,Anchorman,"Tonight, a possible attack on Iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the Middle East."
2200,11,9,Sharon Marsh,Oh no.
2201,11,9,Anchorman,"But first, the record for the world's biggest crap: will it again be broken?"
2202,11,9,Sharon Marsh,[disgusted and annoyed] Agh!
2203,11,9,Anchorman,"Randy Marsh of Colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap, spending nearly every waking hour at P.F. Chang's. [a shot of Randy feasting away on noodles, shrimp, crab legs, etc.]."
2204,11,9,Female Anchor,Is this really newsworthy?
2205,11,9,Anchorman,You just don't understand.
2206,11,9,Female Anchor,You're right. I don't.
2207,11,9,Anchorman,"[the camera zooms in on him] At the same time, some people are questioning Bono's current record entry, saying nobody has ever seen it in person. Bono could not be reached for comment, as he is currently in Africa helping the needy."
2208,11,9,Bono,"Hello, hello."
2209,11,9,Broloff,Marsh is attempting to break the record again. We thought you should know.
2210,11,9,Bono,He can't beat my nine and a half Courics!
2211,11,9,Broloff,Well he's going to try.
2212,11,9,Bono,"Fine, but he has to take the crap in front of you! In Zurich."
2213,11,9,Broloff,"Bono, we've never had that rule before."
2214,11,9,Bono,"I's the only way you can know 'e's not cheating! If he doesn't crap in Zurich, it shouldn't count!"
2215,11,9,Dr. Doctor and Assistant,"Ultrasound is very simple, Mr. Marsh. We're going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly. Just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first. [does this and lets it spread]"
2216,11,9,Randy Marsh,Oooooo.
2217,11,9,Dr. Doctor and Assistant,"Okay, take a deep breath. [Randy takes the breath and the assistant puts the camera on the belly, then turns to the monitor to his right] I see the crap now. I can't say for sure, but I, I'd say is about... 14 Courics."
2218,11,9,Jimbo Kern,Fourteen?! [grins]
2219,11,9,Stephen Stotch,"That's great, Randy!"
2220,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Can I, can I see it?"
2221,11,9,Dr. Doctor and Assistant,"Sure. This is your colon, a-and here... [softly, warmly] is the feces growing inside your belly. [a musicbox begins to play as Randy marvels at his poop]"
2222,11,9,Randy Marsh,Ahhh...
2223,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,"[rushes into the room] Guys, we have a problem! [the Emmy and banner disappear] I talked to the EFSM and they say Randy has to take the crap in Zurich."
2224,11,9,Randy Marsh,In Zurich?
2225,11,9,Gerald Broflovski,They say that Bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied.
2226,11,9,Dr. Doctor and Assistant,"I'm sorry Mr. Marsh, I I cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition. It is never safe to fly during your turd trimester."
2227,11,9,Stan Marsh,"Hi, could I speak with Mr. Bono, please?"
2228,11,9,Butler,"Mr. Bono, you have a young gentleman caller! [two doors fly open and Bono dances out of a ballroom]"
2229,11,9,Bono,"Get the jet ready, Bovis! I've got to be going. [puts on his hat]"
2230,11,9,Stan Marsh,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. My dad's trying to beat your record for biggest crap."
2231,11,9,Bono,"Oh right. He can't make it to Zurich, right?"
2232,11,9,Stan Marsh,That's kind of what I'm here for: Do you really need the biggest crap record? Could you maybe see your way to just... letting my dad have this one?
2233,11,9,Bono,Let him have it? Why would I do that?!
2234,11,9,Stan Marsh,"Look, you you gotta understand, sir. My dad's never won an award for anything. Ever. He doesn't have one single trophy. I mean, even I have a second-place trophy for most Sports Illustrated subscriptions sold."
2235,11,9,Bono,[walks over to his trophy section and whips out a trophy containing an open magazine.] I have the first-place trophy for that.
2236,11,9,Stan Marsh,"[a bit shocked] Dude, don't you have enough? I mean, you got tons of money, a jet, and the biggest rock band in the world, a hot wife, and, you've been knighted. I mean, at some point, can't you just kind of... fuck off?"
2237,11,9,Bono,I want people to know that I'm worth something. That I matter.
2238,11,9,Stan Marsh,"All I'm asking is that maybe with this one thing, let my dad be number 1. A-and you can still be number 2."
2239,11,9,Bono,"[insulted] Number two?! NUMBER TWO?! [grabs Stan, throws him up against a gold record on the wall and holds him there]"
2240,11,9,Stan Marsh,Agh!
2241,11,9,Bono,Nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!
2242,11,9,Stan Marsh,I take it back!
2243,11,9,Bono,Say I'm not number two!
2244,11,9,Stan Marsh,You're not number two!
2245,11,9,Bono,"That's right! I'm not! [releases him and dances back to the ballroom, singing away. The butler returns]"
2246,11,9,Stan Marsh,What is wrong with that guy?
2247,11,9,Butler,Your father is in grave danger. Come with me! [Stan follows him out]
2248,11,9,Chubby Official,It must be quite a crap.
2249,11,9,Jimbo Kern,"Come on, Randy. You have to push! [Randy takes several more quick breaths and pushes...]"
2250,11,9,Stan Marsh,What are you saying?! How do you know my dad is gonna die?!
2251,11,9,Butler,Because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before!
2252,11,9,Stan Marsh,So Bono's newest record is a lie!
2253,11,9,Butler,"Look, I first knew something was wrong when I looked at Bono's first award for biggest crap. It said he took it in 1960."
2254,11,9,Stan Marsh,So?
2255,11,9,Butler,"So that's the year Bono was born. Then it all made sense to me. How could Bono be so talented, so caring, and yet seem like such a piece of crap? Because he is crap. Don't you get it? Bono is not the record holder..."
2256,11,9,Stan Marsh,He's the record.
2257,11,9,Butler,[whispers] Yes.
2258,11,9,Randy Marsh,[in frustration] I can't do it! I can't do it!
2259,11,9,Dr. Doctor and Assistant,"The crap is simply too big, Mr. Marsh. We must perform a Caesarean!"
2260,11,9,Randy Marsh,"But then, does it still count?"
2261,11,9,Bono,Oh no! The biggest crap means you crapped it out!
2262,11,9,Broloff,"I believe that's true. We are sorry, Mr. Marsh, but, if you cannot crap out the crap, it's not really a crap."
2263,11,9,Randy Marsh,[sobs] No... Nooo...
2264,11,9,Jimbo Kern,"There there Randy, you... You gave it your best shot."
2265,11,9,Randy Marsh,I want my wife. Sharon? Sharon? [she walks up to him]
2266,11,9,Sharon Marsh,[pissed off] What?!
2267,11,9,Randy Marsh,"I'm sorry, Sharon. Sorry that I let you down. Sorry I can't crap like Bono."
2268,11,9,Broloff,"Well congratulations, Bono, it appears your record is intact."
2269,11,9,Bono,I had a feeling it would be.
2270,11,9,Stan Marsh,"[runs in] Wait! Stop! Dad, your old crap counts. Bono never took a second crap to beat yours."
2271,11,9,Bono,Get him out of here!
2272,11,9,Third Official,"What are you talking about, young man?"
2273,11,9,Stan Marsh,Somebody's been keeping it a secret. Bono was never the record holder! He's the record!
2274,11,9,Bono,It's not true! Kill the kid! I want him dead!
2275,11,9,Broloff,"It's too late, Bono. The boy has learned the truth."
2276,11,9,Chubby Official,"Herr Broloff, what do you know of this?"
2277,11,9,Broloff,"It's true, I'm afraid. You see, until Mr. Marsh came along, I was the record holder for the biggest crap. I took it back in 1960. It was the most amazing crap I'd ever taken."
2278,11,9,Bono,Poppa no! Say nothing more!
2279,11,9,Broloff,"Come to me my... darling precious child. [Bono sobs and walks over to him. Broloff hugs him] After I had broken the record I took the crap home. I was so proud of it that I... decided to keep it, to try and raise it like a child."
2280,11,9,Bono,No Poppa... No Poppa...
2281,11,9,Broloff,"[strokes his hair] There there, my little crap. [props Bono's chin up] Don't cry. [unbuttons his coat, vest, and shirt] Here, do you want the biddy? Hm? [holds his left breast out to Bono] Does Bono want the biddy? [Bono whimpers and begins sucking on the teat] Yes, he likes the biddy doesn't he?"
2282,11,9,Stan Marsh,Dude.
2283,11,9,Broloff,"I kept the crap in my office, nursed it, fed it biddy. And soon biddy made him strong. Biddy made him grow up! Into one of the most influential figures of our time. [looks down] Easy Bono, that hurts the biddy."
2284,11,9,Bono,Biddy. [keeps sucking]
2285,11,9,Broloff,"My little crap has accomplished many things. But he could never shed the fact that he was really... a number two. So he spent his life trying to be number one, in everything."
2286,11,9,Stan Marsh,"That's why he's able to do so much, try to help so many people, but still seem like such a piece of shit."
2287,11,9,Chubby Official,"You have blemished this noble society's good name, Herr Broloff."
2288,11,9,Broloff,Have I?! [pops Bono off his tit. Bono tries helplessly to return to the tit and suck on it] Look at the crap I took all those years ago! Bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 Courics in weight! No matter how you look at it he IS still the record!
2289,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh God, here it comes! [everyone gathers around him again, even Sharon] Ohhh hot hot hot hot! HOTTT hot hot hot hot hot! Hot! Hot! [he poops, and begins to rise as the poop piles on] Ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot [finally stops. Beneath him is a pillar of poop almost six feet tall]"
2290,11,9,Third Official,My God...
2291,11,9,Chubby Official,It must be over a hundred Courics!
2292,11,9,Stan Marsh,"Dad, are you all right?"
2293,11,9,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, I'm... [looks down at his accomplishment] I'm good! [arms akimbo] Feel a lot better."
2294,11,9,Chubby Official,"[approaching] Mr. Marsh, we apologize, and if it's okay with you, we would like to present you... your long overdue trophy. [the banner disappears, but the official reaches out and grabs the Emmy. He walks over and jams it into the pillar of poop. Everyone claps except Stan and Sharon.]"
2295,11,10,Eric Cartman,"All right, let's try over here. [points straight ahead. Jason appears behind them] Set up traps there, and there as well. [points right] Last time I saw him he ran right through here. [moves, revealing Stan further back. Cartman moves to his left, and Kyle is seen sitting on a fallen tree]"
2296,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"This is so retarded, Cartman. You've got everyone believing your stupid story."
2297,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[sets up a trip wire between two stones] It isn't a story, it's true! I saw a leprechaun. I've seen him come through here three days in a row now. [drops the rope, walks forward, and whips out a walkie-talkie] Hawk Eyes, this is Dragon Wind. Do you copy?"
2298,11,10,Clyde Donovan,"This is Hawk Eyes. We've set up the net and we're standing by. [behind him are Jimmy, Jason, and Craig hoisting the net into place]"
2299,11,10,Eric Cartman,"Copy that, Hawk Eyes. Keep surveillance tag Alpha Niner. Dragon Wind out. [Tweek joins Stan in the background]"
2300,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Just admit you were lying, Cartman, so that everyone can go home!"
2301,11,10,Eric Cartman,"O-ho no! We have a deal, Kyle! If I can prove there's a leprechaun, you have to suck my balls, remember?! [whips out his walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Blackie: What's your six, Blackie?"
2302,11,10,Token Black,[pissed off] ... I don't want the code name Blackie.
2303,11,10,Eric Cartman,"Code names are what they are, Blackie! Check your six and alert when in position! [puts away the walkie talkie and gets back to setting the trip wire.]"
2304,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,This is fucking retarded!
2305,11,10,Eric Cartman,"Hahaha, getting nervous, Kyle? When that leprechauns shows up you must suck my balls! Don't forget I have a signed contract from you. [finishes setting the trip wire]"
2306,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, and if you couldn't prove there was a leprechaun, you have to give me ten dollars! Now just pay up and stop being stupid!"
2307,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[whispers loudly] Goddammit, why hasn't it shown up yet? [whips out the walkie talkie] Dragon Wind to Faggot! Come in, Faggot!"
2308,11,10,Butters Stotch,[stands on a lookout platform with a telescope next to him. He answers in a subdued manner] This is faggot. Go ahead.
2309,11,10,Eric Cartman,Faggot I need you to keep surveillance North to North East. Check back in five.
2310,11,10,Butters Stotch,"Okay, will do. Faggot out. [turns right and looks through the telescope] Waagh."
2311,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, that's enough. [hops off the tree and walks forward] Everybody! Cartman is just pulling one of his stupid tricks on everyone, because he's trying to get out of a deal he made!"
2312,11,10,Eric Cartman,"It was here, I swear it! I don't know why it's not showin' up this time!"
2313,11,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You didn't see a leprechaun, fatass! If you could prove it, I had to suck your balls, but if you couldn't, you had to pay me ten dollars! Pay up!"
2314,11,10,Butters Stotch,"Uh, I got somethin'! I got it! [the other boys turn and pay attention] It's uh... Oh jeez I thnk it's a leprechaun!"
2315,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[to Token] Set off diversion track C! [Token sets off a small bomb under a pile of leaves. Nearby a leprechaun skips into view, then stops upon seeing the boys]"
2316,11,10,Stan Marsh,Dude...
2317,11,10,Jimmy,"Fuh, fuck me, it's a leprechaun."
2318,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[charging forth] Get it! [the leprechaun runs away, and all the boys except Kyle, who is dumbfounded, give chase] Get that fucking leprechaun! I want it alive! [the leprechaun crawls under a tree trunk and gets up. He trips over a rope and a net descends on him; he dodges it and runs off. He runs into a bush and trips a sliding door, which drops down behind him. It traps him in a cage. He looks around for a way out, but sees the boys crowd in.]"
2319,11,10,Butters Stotch,Wow.
2320,11,10,Stan Marsh,Cool.
2321,11,10,Craig Tucker,No way.
2322,11,10,Token Black,Whoa.
2323,11,10,Jason,Wow.
2324,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[making his way through, out of breath] Eugh! Uh, move aside! Move aside! All right, butthole, where's the gold?!"
2325,11,10,Leprechaun,You lads don't know what you're doin'. I need to deliver an important message! There's goin' to be an attack!
2326,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[gets out a Bowie knife] Tell me where the gold is or you die! [unsheathes it] Slow! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him out and disappears]"
2327,11,10,Stan Marsh,Where'd he go? [the leprechaun appears on a tree limb behind the boys; they turn to look at him again]
2328,11,10,Leprechaun,"I was sent to warn of a terrorist attack, but you boys have made me late. Now the terrorists will prevail! The end is near! [the leprechaun makes a rainbow with his right hand, and it teleports him away and disappears]"
2329,11,10,Craig Tucker,Dude.
2330,11,10,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle and clears his throat] Kyle, suck my balls. [brings out the contract both of them signed. Kyle stands motionless]"
2331,11,11,Cartman,[voiceover] Previously on Battlestar Galactica [clips from last week's episode follow]
2332,11,11,Stan,What is this place?
2333,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,This... is Imaginationland.
2334,11,11,A Terrorist,"[runs in out of nowhere] ALLAH!!! [the terrorist sets off the bomb as everyone else leans back. The explosion sends creatures flying everywhere, with some of them dying as their bodies fall apart.]"
2335,11,11,Kyle,[above all the noise] WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!
2336,11,11,Butters,"[running up to the boys as Draco takes off with them] Hold on, fellas!"
2337,11,11,The Boys,Butters.
2338,11,11,General,Terrorists have just attacked... our imagination.
2339,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"[to Butters] If the terrorists blow that barrier, all the most evil things ever imagined are gonna pour out!"
2340,11,11,Terrorists,"ALLAH!! [they charge forth with Rockety Rocket toward the door, then push him forward. Butters jumps out of the way.]"
2341,11,11,Rockety Rocket,No!! [reaches the door and blows up. The terrorists cheer and fire away into the air. Butters gets up near the survivors]
2342,11,11,Steven Stotch,"[voiceover] Butters, time for breakfast."
2343,11,11,Butters,"Buh, huh, but... Oh jeez, it was just a dream."
2344,11,11,Steven Stotch,"[enters with Linda, who's holding a plate] Come on, Butters. Mom's cooked waffles and nanas for you."
2345,11,11,Butters,"[chuckles with relief] Hoho! Mom, Dad, I dreamt I was in Imaginationland and, and terrorists attacked it."
2346,11,11,Steven Stotch,You are in Imaginationland. This is a dream.
2347,11,11,Butters,Huh?
2348,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"[breaking into the dream] Hey, wake up, stupid! [the bedroom transitions into Imaginationland] Come on, wake up, kid!"
2349,11,11,Butters,"[wakes and stands up] No, wait! Uh I was back home in bed!"
2350,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,NO! You passed out and peed your pants!
2351,11,11,Cinderella,Look! The evil of Imaginationland is coming out! [monsters from the evil side pour through the broken wall. The survivors from the terrorist attack turn and run away]
2352,11,11,Butters,"Oh hamburgers! [the terrorists fire off their guns, but a monster wipes them out]"
2353,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"Everyone! Fall back to the Gumdrop Forest! [catches up to Butters] Come with me, little boy! I'm going to get you home! [an Alien jumps into view and jumps around the Mayor]"
2354,11,11,Butters,"WAAAA! It's Alien! [points to the Xenomorph, which grabs the Mayor, lifts him up, and attacks him from behind and pierces right through him, killing him instantly. Butters runs away, only to be spotted by a Predator with laser sights. Butters avoids the lasers] Predator! Wha? [an army of Imperial Stormtroopers head his way. A heavy footfall behind him alerts him to Jason Voorhees's presence. He jumps] Huh? [Jason takes out his machete and slashes at him, but Butters ducks it and runs away] WAAAAAH! HAAAAAAAA! [geometric shapes and Tribbles join the fray]"
2355,11,11,Stan,"Look, we already told you everything we know. Some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into Imaginationland."
2356,11,11,General,[stops and places his hands on the table] What we want to know is how! We need to find a way into Imaginationland; you've been there! How did you do it?!
2357,11,11,Kyle,We just... went on a balloon ride.
2358,11,11,Specialist,There must have been some kind of portal or doorway.
2359,11,11,Stan,"Dude, we don't remember."
2360,11,11,General,"Do you realize what's goin' on here?! Terrorists have attacked our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild! [wags his left index finger at them] You'd better start remembering!"
2361,11,11,Specialist,"It was the Chinese, wasn't it?"
2362,11,11,Kyle,...What?
2363,11,11,Specialist,We've suspected that the Chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination. [wags his right index finger at them] Is that where you were?!
2364,11,11,Stan,No.
2365,11,11,General,"That's it, isn't it?! Where do the Chinese keep this portal? How does it work?"
2366,11,11,Specialist,It is better than ours?
2367,11,11,Stan,Your what?
2368,11,11,Specialist,Our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the Soviets-
2369,11,11,General,[puts his hands on his hips] Shhh! Tom! That's super-secret.
2370,11,11,Tom,"[a bit chagrined] Ohh, I'm sorry sir."
2371,11,11,Kyle,Wait. The U.S. Government has a portal to the imagination?
2372,11,11,General,"Aw, see? Good job, Tom! Why don't you just tell them everything about Project X?!"
2373,11,11,Tom,"Yes sir. [to the boys] We built a portal to the imagination to use against the Russians during the Cold War, but we never got a-"
2374,11,11,General,"THAT WAS SARCASM. I was being sarcastic, you fucking idiot!"
2375,11,11,Tom,"[more chagrined] Aw jeez, I'm really sorry sir."
2376,11,11,Stan,"If you already built a doorway to the imagination, then why do you need us?"
2377,11,11,General,"[turns his back to the boys] All right, we might as well show it to them. [whispers] God-dammit, Tom."
2378,11,11,Cartman,"[voiceover] Every night, the dream is the same. [a field of grain pops up with purple mountains in the background. Cartman walks in smiling and holding the contract] I'm on my way to visit my friend Kyle, because we had a bet that if I could prove leprechauns were real, he would suck my balls. [Kyle is standing in the field, and Cartman walks up to him] And it turns out I was right. ""Time to pay up, Kyle."" [Kyle's name echoes into the distance] But then... [Kyle turns around with his mouth sewn shut] ""NO! NOOO!"" [Cartman rises into the air and the field fades to black] It's been taken from me. I have dry balls. Balls so dry they explode like dust. [he floats through the darkness. His right testicle pops and dissolves into the air. His left one does the same, and there's no penis left either.]"
2379,11,11,Elderly woman,"You okay, kid?"
2380,11,11,Cartman,NO. I've got dry balls. And I'm running out of time.
2381,11,11,General,"Ever since the Cold War, the U.S. Government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination. It is called ""Project Imagination Doorway."""
2382,11,11,Stan,That's not very imaginative.
2383,11,11,General,"According to all the tests and the data, the doorway should work, but... it never has."
2384,11,11,Lead tech,"But we're close, sir. We're real close."
2385,11,11,General,They've been saying that for over forty years.
2386,11,11,Lead tech,"[walks up and stands next to the general] You're the ones, right? The kids who have been in the imagination."
2387,11,11,Kyle,Ah I guess.
2388,11,11,Lead tech,"What was the sequence that got you inside? We know there's some kind of... resonance code, but we can't figure it out."
2389,11,11,Kyle,"Look, we're sorry, you guys, but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there."
2390,11,11,General,Song? You didn't say anything about a song before.
2391,11,11,Lead tech,What song?
2392,11,11,Stan,The Imagination song?
2393,11,11,Lead tech,That could be it. The fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code!
2394,11,11,General,Quick boys: how does the Imagination Song go?
2395,11,11,Stan,[unsure of the notes] Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation
2396,11,11,Kyle,[unsure of the notes] Imaginaaaation Imaginaaaation
2397,11,11,Operator,"Sir, uh I'm getting some electrofeedback from the gate. Ih it's weak, but it's nanoresponding to something."
2398,11,11,Lead tech,"[urgently] Was there more to the Imagination Song? Ha, how does the rest of it go?"
2399,11,11,Stan,Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-
2400,11,11,Kyle,Imaginaaaation. Imaginaaaa-
2401,11,11,Kyle,"No, no dude, it went up there."
2402,11,11,Stan,Imagina-he-hey-
2403,11,11,Kyle,Imagina-eh
2404,11,11,Stan,"[to the general] Dude, we don't remember. It was really long and stupid."
2405,11,11,General,I'm just about through playing with you boys! We're running out of time! You have to remember that song in its entirety! [Stan and Kyle look at each other.]
2406,11,11,Lollipop King,"Mayor, Mayor, what are we supposed to do?"
2407,11,11,Butters,"Please, sir. I have to get home to my world."
2408,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"Oh, well. All you have to do is tap your heels together three times."
2409,11,11,Butters,Really?
2410,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"NO, you fucking dipshit, that was a joke! [groans for a few seconds more]"
2411,11,11,Snarf,"Mayor, what are we supposed to do, shnarf shnarf?"
2412,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,Get to Castle Sunshine! It's your only hope!
2413,11,11,Lollipop King,Castle Sunshine?
2414,11,11,Fanciful Mayor,"Through the Gumdrop Forest. Others will be hiding there; go, run! Look out for the evil characters! They're assembling on the Yum Yum mountain! [groans once more and dies]"
2415,11,11,Orc,We are free! Now all of Imaginationland is ours!
2416,11,11,The Minotaur,"Not all, foolish orc! There are still parts of Imaginationland we don't control."
2417,11,11,Freddy Krueger,"Tomorrow, we shall build our own castle right on this spot!"
2418,11,11,The Minotaur,"Who put you in charge, Krueger?! I am the most evil character here!"
2419,11,11,ManBearPig,"[half bear, half manpig] Nonsense! [somehow, he's been spliced together and brought to life] Your evil is stale!"
2420,11,11,Headless Horseman,[holding a flaming jack-o-lantern on his left hand] I am the most evil imaginary character! [Krueger hisses]
2421,11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"[hops into view] Now come on y'all. We shouldn't be fightin', we're supposed to all be on the same side. [the rest of the Woodland Critters arrive]"
2422,11,11,Critter,"Yeah. You're all right, Squirrelly Squirrel."
2423,11,11,Woodland Critters,Yaaaay!
2424,11,11,The Minotaur,What evil imaginary characters are they?
2425,11,11,Creature from the Black Lagoon,They were dreamt up by some fourth grade kid as part of his Christmas Story..
2426,11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"Now come on y'all. We can't waste time arguing, there could still be survivors out there. We need to hunt them down, and kill them."
2427,11,11,Rabbity Rabbit,And eat their flesh!
2428,11,11,Beavery Beaver,B'hut first we should rape them!
2429,11,11,Beary Bear,"How about we kill them, and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant?"
2430,11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"Say, that's a great idea, Beary Bear. [the Critters cheer and jump for joy]"
2431,11,11,Jason Voorhees,"[to Khan in a campish voice] Man, I do not want to meet the kid that dreamt THOSE things up."
2432,11,11,Cartman,"Look, I want some Goddamn answers! You brought my friend here to Washington! Where is he?! What is going on?!"
2433,11,11,Secretary,"[at the Pentagon] I'm sorry, sir. That information is classified."
2434,11,11,Cartman,"Something is going on, and I have a right to know where my friend is!!"
2435,11,11,Secretary,[sees Tom arriving] There's somebody asking a lot of questions about what's going on.
2436,11,11,Tom,"Let me handle this! [takes the receiver] I'm sorry, but there is no such thing as Project Imagination Doorway! [listens] Imagination Doorway. It was started in the Sixties as a secret government project. Right."
2437,11,11,Stan,"Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-"
2438,11,11,Kyle,"Imagina-a-ation, Imagina-"
2439,11,11,Stan,"Waitwaitwait, maybe that's where he went really flat, like that half-step key change? Imagina-ation."
2440,11,11,Kyle,"Right, then it was ""Imagina-ation, Imagina-ation. Imagina-atio-on"" [the lights dim and the portal begins to glow. The boys are confused for a moment, then face the portal with the other people present]"
2441,11,11,Lead tech,It's open! It's open!
2442,11,11,Operator,"Getting readings from the other side... the, that's it. We've made an opening to our imagination, sir! [the officers and techs all cheer and hug each other. Stan and Kyle stand there, awed]"
2443,11,11,General,"All right, that's enough! We've still got a lot of work to do, people! Its time to go in and get our imaginations under control!"
2444,11,11,Butters,How much further to Castle Sunshine?
2445,11,11,Snarf,"Snarf, I'm not sure snarf snarf. I've never been. [a female scream stops them in their tracks]"
2446,11,11,Butters,What was that?
2447,11,11,Lollipop King,"[walks to his left into the woods] Over here. [the other two follow and peer over some bushes] Oh Christ. Its Strawberry Shortcake. [in a clearing, Strawberry Shortcake sits on a stump, tied up so she can't move. Many evil characters surround her, ready to do her great harm]"
2448,11,11,Strawberry Shortcake,"Please, let me go. [the Headless Horseman kicks her] Wuh. [Frankenstein's Monster kicks her] Wuh! [an Imperial Stormtrooper smacks her around with his rifle] Dugh! [Jason walks up and put his knife under her eyes...]"
2449,11,11,Snarf,Oh my God! Snarf. [and scoops out her left eyeball.]
2450,11,11,Strawberry Shortcake,Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah!
2451,11,11,The Minotaur,Now kill her!
2452,11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,"[the Woodland Critters show up] Whoa whoa, hang on, y'all. You can't just kill her. That's not evil enough."
2453,11,11,Freddy Krueger,What do you mean? We cut out her eyeball.
2454,11,11,Jason Voorhees,"Yeah, that's super hardcore."
2455,11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,Now come on y'all. We can do better than that.
2456,11,11,Beavery Beaver,Hey! I know! Let's all pee in her empty eye socket!
2457,11,11,Deery Deer,"Let's make her eat her own eyeball, and then pee in her empty eyesocket."
2458,11,11,Beary Bear,"How about we get someone with AIDS to pee in her eyesocket, so she dies all slowlike? [the other Critters cheer at the idea]"
2459,11,11,The Minotaur,Nobody here has AIDS!
2460,11,11,Woodland Critters,Awwww!!
2461,11,11,Beary Bear,But we've got to have AIDS before we pee in her eyesocket!
2462,11,11,Squirrelly Squirrel,Now don't be down y'all. I bet we can find some AIDS out in the forest. [the Critters scatter in renewed enthusiasm]
2463,11,11,Lollipop King,"Dude, run, run, ruuun! [Butters and Snarf leave quickly, and he follows]"
2464,11,11,General,"All right, men. We don't know what you'll experience on the other side of this doorway, but it will most likely be really weird. If you reach our imagination, you are to take every step necessary to get it under control! Are you ready?"
2465,11,11,Soldiers,Yes sir!
2466,11,11,General,"Are you ready, Kurt Russell?"
2467,11,11,Kurt Russell,[dressed in camouflage like the others] I... I don't understand why I'm here. I I'm just an actor.
2468,11,11,General,"Yes, but you were in that one movie that was kinda like this. That gives you more experience than anybody. All right, here we go! Men! Forwaaard!"
2469,11,11,Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!"
2470,11,11,General,What?!
2471,11,11,Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!"
2472,11,11,General,"Sector Two?? [a large window at the far end of the room shatters as Cartman tumbles in, landing on his back. Everyone turns to see him]"
2473,11,11,Kyle,Cartman??
2474,11,11,Cartman,"[gets up quickly and marches towards Kyle] Hello Kyle! Thought you could get out of your responsibilities, huh?!"
2475,11,11,General,Who the hell are you?!
2476,11,11,Cartman,"That kid you have made a bit that if I could prove that I saw a leprechaun, he would suck my balls!"
2477,11,11,General,Get him out of here!
2478,11,11,Cartman,[some guards seize him and begin to drag him away] No! Hold on a second! [they stop and let him go] I have a contract [holds it out] validated by the United States court system!
2479,11,11,General,"Let me see that! [a guard takes it from Cartman over to the general, who reads it over] Why would you agree to suck someone's balls?"
2480,11,11,Kyle,I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS GOING TO BE A GOD-DAMNED LEPRECHAUN!!
2481,11,11,General,"All right, you two can go use the conference room. Go on, we have work to do here."
2482,11,11,Kyle,"[stunned] Wha?! Well wait, ahah I wanna see what happens here!"
2483,11,11,General,"You signed an agreement, kid. We don't have time for this. Go on and do it."
2484,11,11,Kyle,"[looks at the general, than at Stan] Stan?"
2485,11,11,Stan,"Dude, you did make a deal... [Kyle has run out of appeals and reluctantly follows Cartman out]"
2486,11,11,Cartman,Theee conference room is which way? [smiles]
2487,11,11,Cartman,"Here we are, Kyle. You tried to bail out on our agreement, but I found you."
2488,11,11,Kyle,"I didn't ""bail,"" I got picked up by the government!"
2489,11,11,Cartman,"Well we're here now, that's all that matters. [brings up a small cup of mixed nuts] Care for some nuts? Oh, that's right. I guess you'll be chock full of nuts in a few minutes."
2490,11,11,Kyle,"Cartman, do you even know what's going on? We went to Imaginationland, terrorists attacked it, and now the government is about to-"
2491,11,11,Cartman,"[cuts him off with a loud yawn and hops off his chair] Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Kyle. [walks towards a tripod and sets a camera on it] It's just that I'm so completely bored by this story. See, I'm really only interested in the part where the leprechaun was real, and so you have to suck my balls."
2492,11,11,Kyle,"Okay, fine. You know what? Let's just get it over with!"
2493,11,11,Cartman,"Oh nonono, nononot so fast, Kyle. [starts unzipping a duffle bag] I've waited a long time for this, and I intend to savor each and every second. [pulls out a purple robe]"
2494,11,11,Kyle,"No, I'm serious! I wanna see what's happening downstairs, so let's just do it! [pounds the table with his left fist]"
2495,11,11,Cartman,"[puts on the robe] Not... just yet, Kyle. There's still a few things I need to do. [pulls out a crown and turns to face Kyle] By the way, I should tell you that I haven't had a chance to shower while making my way up here. My balls are... [puts on the crown] extra vinegary..."
2496,11,11,Kyle,Just get to it already!
2497,11,11,Lead tech,Entering the portal in five seconds.
2498,11,11,General,"Kurt Russell, can I get a comm check?"
2499,11,11,Kurt Russell,"Check 1, 2."
2500,11,11,General,"Good luck men! Godspeed! [the soldiers walk up the ramp and through the portal] What do we have?! Kurt Russell, can you hear me?"
2501,11,11,Kurt Russell,[voice only] We're here. We're s-somewhere.
2502,11,11,Tech 3,"They are inside the imagination, sir."
2503,11,11,General,What do you see in there?
2504,11,11,Kurt Russell,"There's lots of... big mushrooms, colorful grass, some castles in the distance, eh... Wait. Something's coming for us! It's coming out of the bushes and- [everyone braces for the worst] It's a-! ...Oh, Aw, it's just a cute little squirrel. [Everyone relaxes. Stan draws a sigh of relief] Hey, it talks, haha. The little squirrel talks."
2505,11,11,Lead tech,"Awww, an imaginary talking squirrel."
2506,11,11,Techs,Awww.
2507,11,11,General,Ask the squirrel what it knows about the terrorist attack.
2508,11,11,Kurt Russell,"Wait a minute, eh. The squirrel has friends. Oh why, why it's a whole bunch of woodland critters."
2509,11,11,Stan,"Wait, woodland critters... [begins searching his memory]"
2510,11,11,Kurt Russell,"There's a talking bear and a beaver, uh... the, they seem to be Christmas critters. Well hello. Yes, hi."
2511,11,11,Stan,Get them out of there!
2512,11,11,General,What?
2513,11,11,Stan,Tell them to get away now!
2514,11,11,General,What's the matter?
2515,11,11,Kurt Russell,"Oh the... cute little bear's eyes are starting to glow red now... Uh hello there, little animals, do you happen to know how to huh? OW! AAAAAAAHHHH!"
2516,11,11,General,"Kurt Russell, what's going on?!"
2517,11,11,Kurt Russell,They're raping mee!! They're raping meee!!!
2518,11,11,General,"Get out of there, Kurt Russell!"
2519,11,11,Kurt Russell,They're raping all of us! Whoaho! Oh it hurts! They're raping us and it huuurts! Waaagh!
2520,11,11,Cartman,I was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field. What do you think?
2521,11,11,Kyle,"Goddammit Cartman, will you stop wasting time? I wanna get this over with!"
2522,11,11,Cartman,"No, you're right, Kyle. A higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus. [sets the depth] There we go. [smiles, then returns to his seat] Now, Kyle, when you're sucking my balls, are you gonna think about how right I was about the leprechaun, or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth?"
2523,11,11,Kyle,Let's just DO IT! [pounds the table with both fists]
2524,11,11,Cartman,"In time, Kyle. You certainly are eager for balls, aren't you? Are you ball-famished? Balls-starving? You see, Kyle, I wonder if at this moment you are actually- [a red alert interrupts him]"
2525,11,11,Guard,Everyone to the main hall now! Go!
2526,11,11,Cartman,"Uh, no, no, we're not done in here yet."
2527,11,11,Guard,Everyone to the main hall NOW! [Kyle heads for the door and out behind the security guard]
2528,11,11,Cartman,No! Goddammit no!
2529,11,11,Snarf,"Boy snarf snarf, my feet are really gettin' tired snarf."
2530,11,11,Butters,"Aww, Sn-Snarf, could you maybe like sh-shut up for five minutes?"
2531,11,11,Lollipop King,"Wait! There it is. We made it! [a rather impressive complex looms before them] Castle Sunshine! [they rejoice at the sight, but a hissing sound follows] Hurry! Get inside! [they run towards the castle]"
2532,11,11,Perseus,The evil imaginary characters are approaching! Lock down the gates! Prepare to fire the cannons! [more survivors walk in]
2533,11,11,Butters,Wait! Waaait! [the trio reach the castle gate and Perseus stops them with his sword]
2534,11,11,Perseus,What imaginary character are you?!
2535,11,11,Lollipop King,The Lollipop King? From the Lollipop Forest?
2536,11,11,Snarf,"And I'm Snarf. Snarf, snarf snarf snarf."
2537,11,11,Perseus,[to Butters] And what imaginary character are you?
2538,11,11,Butters,"Oh, uhh, uh I'm not imaginary. Ah I'm Butters."
2539,11,11,Perseus,"What's a ""Butters""?"
2540,11,11,Snarf,The Mayor brought him and some other kids into Imaginationland just before the terrorist attack.
2541,11,11,Perseus,So YOU came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists! That seems like quite a coincidence!
2542,11,11,Butters,"I, well I was just playin' with my friends, and then, wu-we caught a leprechaun, and then this guy-"
2543,11,11,Perseus,You caught the Leprechaun? Take him!
2544,11,11,Snarf,Perseus! He's not against us snarf snarf!
2545,11,11,General,Talk to me! What's going on?! [the guard comes in with Kyle and Cartman]
2546,11,11,Lead tech,"Something is... coming through the gate from the other side. [a few moments later, ManBearPig walks through]"
2547,11,11,Operator,What is it?!
2548,11,11,Tech 4,Its like a... half man half bear!
2549,11,11,Lead tech,And half pig! [ManBearPig grabs a tech and slams him against the portal's supporting wall]
2550,11,11,Tech 5,"Oh! No, no wait! It's like a half bear half manpig! [ManBearPig rips the tech's head off and tosses it towards the general. Everyone scatters]"
2551,11,11,General,Look out! [ManBearPig jumps over and grabs the tech at both ends]
2552,11,11,Lead tech,"No! I think it's more like a half man, and half pigbear! [ManBearPig rips him in two at the waist]"
2553,11,11,General,Reverse the doorway! Send it back through!
2554,11,11,Kyle,"AAAHHH! [runs away, but ManBearPig scoops him up]"
2555,11,11,Stan,"KYLE!! [a fading tech pushes the red button at his station as he drops to the floor. Lightning flashes into the room as a tractor beam pulls Stan into the portal. ManBearPig resists the pull, but crushes Kyle in its left hand for several seconds]"
2556,11,11,Kyle,"AAAAAAAAAAAA- [ManBearPig lets go of Kyle as the tractor beam fiinally pulls it in. Kyle lays on the floor, blue in the face]"
2557,11,11,Butters,Please! I didn't help the terrorists get into Imaginationland! Honest!
2558,11,11,Perseus,That is for the Council of Nine to decide!
2559,11,11,Lollipop King,"Don't worry, kid, the Council of Nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all Imaginationland"
2560,11,11,Aslan,"Fellow Council, these are indeed dark times. The evil forces amass at our gates as we speak. Zeus believes we should evacuate."
2561,11,11,Zeus,Yes. Their power outmatches ours. If they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it!
2562,11,11,Aslan,"And what say you, Morpheus?"
2563,11,11,Morpheus,How our we to know that they will let us go? Their offer could be a trap.
2564,11,11,Glinda,Perhaps we must flee to the Temple of Alderon. Surely they wouldn't chase us there.
2565,11,11,Jesus,"[rises] No, we can't. Come on, you guys, this is our home. We have to fight, to keep it the way it was meant to be."
2566,11,11,Luke Skywalker,"I'm with Jesus. The evil characters aren't going to just let us go. [Popeye says something, but it's unintelligible] That may be, Popeye, but we don't have a choice! [the doors open and the Council looks to see who's entering]"
2567,11,11,Perseus,"Forgive my intrusion, Council of Nine, but this boy has infiltrated from the real world."
2568,11,11,Aslan,Bring him here!
2569,11,11,Paramedic,"Clear! [sends power through the paddles. Kyle rises, then falls softly. No sign of life yet. The paramedic removes the paddles and announces] I'm sorry. He's gone."
2570,11,11,Cartman,No! Kyle can't die. [gets on his knees and checks various parts of his body for a pulse]
2571,11,11,Paramedic,"I'm sorry, young man."
2572,11,11,Cartman,Kyle?
2573,11,11,Paramedic,Well... at least now he doesn't have to suck anyone's balls.
2574,11,11,Cartman,"[enraged] NNNOOO! [begins giving Kyle CPR] No, he has a strong heart! He wants to live! Come on, Kyle! Come on, buddy!"
2575,11,11,General,"He's gone, little boy."
2576,11,11,Cartman,[to the paramedic] Zap him again! [opens Kyle's coat and shirt for better contact] Do it!
2577,11,11,Paramedic,Charging.
2578,11,11,Cartman,DO IT! [the paramedic places the paddles back on Kyle's body] Come on buddy.
2579,11,11,Paramedic,Clear.
2580,11,11,Cartman,"Come on buddy. [the paramedic fires away. Kyle rises, then falls softly. No sign of life yet.] Get out of here! [goes back to giving Kyle CPR. A woman covers her eyes in despair] Godammit Kyle, you never walked away from anything in your life! Now fight! [smacks Kyle around] Fight! Fight! Right now! [begins to break down] Fu-hight! Fu-hu-hight! [pounds Kyle's chest hard] Fight! [Kyle coughs, then comes to. Cartman begins to weep happily.] Give him some air. [an oxygen mask appears and Cartman places it over Kyle's nose and mouth.] There, easy. Breathe easy. [weeps softly some more]"
2581,11,11,Aslan,I believe this child was brought into Imaginationland for a reason. Perhaps the Mayor knew something we don't.
2582,11,11,Zeus,"What are you saying, Aslan? That if we are to take back control, we might-?"
2583,11,11,Morpheus,"Yes. If we are to take back control from the evil forces, this little boy might be the key."
2584,11,11,Butters,"Awww, I'm the key? Could I not be the key, Morpheus? I don't wanna be the key."
2585,11,11,Luke Skywalker,"If you ever wanna see your home again, little boy, you'll have to rise to this challenge."
2586,11,11,Butters,"But I, but I'm supposed to be at school right now, uh, and instead I got, I got Snarf and Popeye and Luke Skywalker all pissed off..."
2587,11,11,Aslan,"It is a dark time for all of us, young boy. But know that if you believe in yourself, everything will turn out all right."
2588,11,11,Tom,Sir? Are you sure about this?
2589,11,11,General,We have no choice. Terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable. There's no other option. [the missile is in place] We have to nuke our imagination. [the missile is lifted and tilted]
2590,11,11,Cartman,"Wake up, Kyle. [Kyle wakes up to a smiling Cartman]"
2591,11,12,Aslan,"[voice only] Imaginationland... used to be a happy place. But then the terrorists attacked. [a shot of a terrorist blowing himself up, killing many imaginary creatures] And so many of us were killed. [a shot of Santa on fire, then a shot of the Barrier falling apart] The Barrier came down, and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed. [the evil characters pour through the Barrier. Next shot is Strawberry Shortcake being kicked by the Headless Horseman, then by Frankenstein's Monster. Aslan now appears] Now our final battle will take place. The evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out. [various shots of evil characters on the march]"
2592,11,12,Beavery Beaver,"This is gonna be fun, huh? [the other Woodland Critters whoop and holler]"
2593,11,12,Aslan,"We prepare for a battle we cannot win. [a shot of Popeye honing swords, then a shot of Luke Skywalker handing swards to imaginary creatures. Totoro gets one, then a robot] Sweet and cuddly imaginary characters, many who have never held a weapon, [Donatello puts a helmet on Snarf's head. Wonder Woman hands a sword to a doll character] must now fight for their very lives. We are too few in number, [Mario takes a full-sized sword and walks away with it without a problem. Superman walks off with a battle axe. A smurf tries to take a sword, but has trouble moving it once it's on the floor. Another character takes a spear] but we have one hope. That is where you come in, young boy. [walks over to Butters as other members of the Council look on] Only you can help us win this battle."
2594,11,12,Butters Stotch,"Wuh, what can I do?"
2595,11,12,Aslan,You have a power here that you have yet to understand.
2596,11,12,Al Gore,"[voice only] Back it up! [the footage is rewound to the part where ManBearPig attacks the tech in blue dress shirt, then stopped.] Look! [points to ManBearPig] Right there! [the tape plays normally] See that?! [the tape stops again where the lead tech is ripped in two] What does that look like to you?! It's ManBearPig! [now onscreen wearing his Nobel Prize medallion] I told you it was real! [three officials watch him from a table in his office] Look again! [fast forwards, then stops when ManBearPig picks up Kyle] There! half man, half bear, and half pig! Do you see it?!"
2597,11,12,Official 1,"Yes, we see it, Mr. Gore."
2598,11,12,Al Gore,"Something big is going on, and the American people need to know what! I'm off! [makes like he's flying away like Superman]"
2599,11,12,Doctor,"He's recovering, but there's been some trauma to his brain. The boy says he's been hearing imaginary voices."
2600,11,12,Stan Marsh,[in Kyle's head] Hello? [Kyle's eyes open and blink] Hello? Anybody? [Kyle's eyes dart around]
2601,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan? [sits up and looks around]
2602,11,12,Stan Marsh,Hello?
2603,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan?
2604,11,12,Eric Cartman,"[comes in smiling with a covered platter on a food cart] Good morning, Kyle. How are we feeling?"
2605,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what's happened?"
2606,11,12,Eric Cartman,"What's happened? Well, let's see: You bet me that I couldn't prove that leprechauns were real. And if I could prove it, you had to suck my balls, I believe."
2607,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I mean what happened at the Pentagon?!"
2608,11,12,Eric Cartman,"[smiles] You just rest, Kyle. [takes the lid off the platter] Look what I made for you. A sundae. It has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry- [suddenly pondering] but... I feel like something is missing; don't you, Kyle? [taps his chin] What else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream, [real softly] let's see"
2609,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Arh!
2610,11,12,Eric Cartman,"Hot fudge, whipped cream, what else belongs on a sundae, Kyle? [turns towards the sundae] What else goes on a sundae besides hot fudge,whipped cream, and ...oh, that's right! [faces Kyle with a determined face] My balls!"
2611,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, what is going on out there?! What happened to Stan?!"
2612,11,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, he got sucked through that portal thing and they're gonna nuke it now. [takes off his cap and begins to pull out yet another costume] So are you all set for your big photo shoot, Kyle?"
2613,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Wwait, what do you mean? Stan's in danger?"
2614,11,12,Eric Cartman,"[now in papal robes] Don't try to change the subject, Kyle. [puts on the papal tiara and pulls the camera and its tripod into place] You've done a really good job of getting out of this bet, but it's finally time to settle. Get ready for your sundae, Kyle. With extra nuts. [closes his eyes and smiles]"
2615,11,12,Jesus Christ,"[arriving with Perseus and the Lollipop King] Aslan, the evil characters are almost here!"
2616,11,12,Aslan,"Get everyone to the battlefield! Defend the castle walls! Quickly young boy, we need your powers now!"
2617,11,12,Butters Stotch,What powers? Ah I don't understand.
2618,11,12,Gandalf,You are real. You are a creator. That means you can imagine things into existence here.
2619,11,12,Butters Stotch,I c-I can?
2620,11,12,Aslan,Santa Claus was killed in the terrorist attack. The first thing we need is for you to bring him back.
2621,11,12,Butters Stotch,How?
2622,11,12,Glinda,You just have to focus your mind. Imagine Santa and nothing else.
2623,11,12,Butters Stotch,How am I supposed to focus with all this crap goin' on?!
2624,11,12,Luke Skywalker,Think only of one thing. Imagine it. Believe in it.
2625,11,12,Gandalf,"Whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be. [Butters closes his eyes to focus, and soon something appears before him. He opens his eyes and sees his father]"
2626,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"[arms akimbo] Butters! [Butters cowers in fear] You are grounded, mister! You hear me?! [suddenly with a deformed leg, elfin ears, horns, and claws instead of fingers, and a deep voice] Grounded!"
2627,11,12,Butters Stotch,"[runs around in circles and then shakes his head is disbelief] AAAAAAAAA! No, nonono, no no no! [Steven vanishes]"
2628,11,12,Aslan,[in Butters' face] What are you doing?! We need Santa!
2629,11,12,Butters Stotch,I'm trying!
2630,11,12,Wonder Woman,"[arrives and kneels down next to him] Come on, kid, imagine Santa! Believe in Santa!"
2631,11,12,Zeus,You must believe in Santa!
2632,11,12,Aslan,BELIEVE IN SANTA! RIGHT NOW!
2633,11,12,Butters Stotch,GAA HAA!
2634,11,12,Eric Cartman,"Kevin, can I get some more bounce off that too, 'kay? Let's just go with a 5 6 8 split"
2635,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, will you shut up? I'm trying to find out what's going on."
2636,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"A new terrorist attack seems to have taken place. This time, in our imagination. [the footage of ManBearPig's killer rampage is shown, with the dialog cut out] Al Gore brought this video to the public's attention, sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly what's going on."
2637,11,12,General,"We were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over, but, two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination, and now our imaginations are running wild."
2638,11,12,Reporter 1,Our imaginations are running wild and we weren't told?!
2639,11,12,General,By attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot. And we've determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination.
2640,11,12,Reporter 2,Is nuking our imagination really prudent?
2641,11,12,Reporter 3,"Aren't there other, more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control?"
2642,11,12,Reporter 4,Couldn't we trying sending Kurt Russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-
2643,11,12,General,We tried that! And Kurt Russell was raped by Christmas Critters!
2644,11,12,Reporter 5,...A-ooch
2645,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"The Pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real, the military doesn't need Senate approval to nuke them."
2646,11,12,Hippie 1,"That's bullcrap, man! You can't nuke our imagination!"
2647,11,12,Hippie 2,Don't nuke our imagination bro! WOOO!
2648,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"Mike, does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination?"
2649,11,12,Mike,"Uh clearly they don't, Steven, and they're gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real. I cite a famous case of Cartman v. Broflovski in which a U.S. court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun."
2650,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"Yes, I believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiff's balls in that case."
2651,11,12,Mike,"That's right, Steven, yeah."
2652,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh for the love of God!
2653,11,12,Stan Marsh,Hello? Can anybody hear me?
2654,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan! Dude, is that you?"
2655,11,12,Stan Marsh,"Kyle? Where are you? I, I don't see you."
2656,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I'm not there. I'm at a hospital. I I'm hearing you in my imagination."
2657,11,12,Stan Marsh,...Oh that makes sense.
2658,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what's happening?"
2659,11,12,Stan Marsh,[walking down the rainbow road] I'm in like a gumdrop forest. I just saw Strawberry Shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye. [some moaning horns are heard] Ha-hang on. I think something really big is about to go down.
2660,11,12,Lollipop King,"The evil characters are here. [Jesus and Robin Hood join him, Jesus ready to fight with his sword]"
2661,11,12,Jesus Christ,"There are so many of them. HAAAAA! [lifts his sword to strike position as the other good characters crowd in. The two sides start fighting, and Waldo is impaled by both sides]"
2662,11,12,Aslan,There's no time left! You have to get control of your imagination and bring Santa back NOW!
2663,11,12,Butters Stotch,Santa. Saaanta.
2664,11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Think. Jolly old Santa. Red suit, white beard."
2665,11,12,Butters Stotch,"Red suit, white beard... Ssssanta! [Poof! Santa appears, but he's horribly deformed. The toys in his toy sack are deformed as well. Butters screams and turns away]"
2666,11,12,Eric Cartman,How does that look? Can you see my balls and the sundae in frame?
2667,11,12,Anchorman Steven,[everyone turns to watch the TV] A shocking new development in the nuking of imagination!
2668,11,12,Chief Justice,"The Supreme Court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real, and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them."
2669,11,12,General,Thank you.
2670,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no.
2671,11,12,Chief Justice,"This of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past, including the famous Cartman v. Broflovski ballsucking case."
2672,11,12,Eric Cartman,...What?
2673,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"So it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation, one they are calling ""Operation Nuke the Imagination Through the Imagination Doorway."""
2674,11,12,Stan Marsh,Kyle? What's happening?
2675,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,The government is gonna nuke Imaginationland.
2676,11,12,Stan Marsh,What?! You can't let them do that!
2677,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,What am I supposed to do?
2678,11,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude you have to stall them! [Kyle doesn't look too sure] Uh- ...uh oh, what is that? Hey! G-get out of here! Leave me alone!"
2679,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Stan? Stan?? [gets out of bed and puts on his clothes]
2680,11,12,Eric Cartman,Where are you going?!
2681,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,I'm going to try to save Stan and Butters from getting nuked!
2682,11,12,Eric Cartman,"Okay okay, but you you have to suck my balls first real quick."
2683,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I don't! The decision was overturned. [walks out of the room]"
2684,11,12,Eric Cartman,[follows him out and watches him walk away] We had a DEAL KYLE!
2685,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"[walking towards the entrance] Yeah, that leprechauns were real! And the government just declared they AREN'T technically real, so I was right! It's over! I don't have to suck your balls!"
2686,11,12,Eric Cartman,"IT ISN'T OVER!! [Kyle turns to face him] It isn't over, Kyle! I have NOT waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet! Go ahead and go. But I swear on my life! Before this day is over! You, will, suck my balls! I SWEAR IT!!"
2687,11,12,Morpheus,"[calling out to the Council members on the bridge] I need more spinach for Popeye! [Freddy gets up and swipes at him, sending him into the air and onto his back. A Tron soldier dispatches Jason Voorhees with a swing of his spear]"
2688,11,12,Tron Soldier,I-ee got one. I got him. [the Woodland Critters approach]
2689,11,12,Beary Bear,Hey there. [the soldier turns around and Bear Bear blows his head apart with two laser beam blasts from his eyes. The Woodland Critters cheer him on. ]
2690,11,12,Icarus,"[flying in from the battlefield, lands on the bridge] We're losing the battle! There are simply too many of them!"
2691,11,12,Aslan,Then the day is lost.
2692,11,12,Wonder Woman,"Wait! Aslan, look! [Aslan looks over. Butters is thinking hard again, and Santa returns, as normal as he ever was. The Council members draw closer to Butters]"
2693,11,12,Santa,What? What happened?
2694,11,12,Luke Skywalker,"You did it, kid!"
2695,11,12,Aslan,Quickly Santa! They need you on the battlefield!
2696,11,12,Santa,"Huh? [discerns the situation] Oh, all right. [grabs a golden axe and leaps over the wall] Make way for Santa! [lands on the field below, then swings the axe at the Minotaur, who falls down. The axe stays buried in the ribs]"
2697,11,12,Aslan,"Now you see your potential, young creator. But there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day!"
2698,11,12,Guard 2,"[sees Kyle and aims his gun at him] This area is restricted, little boy."
2699,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Please, I need to talk to the people inside. They can't set off that nuke."
2700,11,12,Guard 2,"Get behind the line with the other protesters! [Kyle looks, and it's the same group he saw on television moments before]"
2701,11,12,Hippie 3,"No nukes in our imagination, bro! Wooo! [the other hippies cheer him on]"
2702,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Uhn, you don't understand! My friend is in Imaginationland! I can hear him in my head!"
2703,11,12,Guard 2,"You pot-smokin' hippies aren't gettin' through here, so back off!"
2704,11,12,Hippie 4,Stop that nuke!
2705,11,12,Hippies,Stop that nuke!
2706,11,12,Hippies and Kyle,"Stop that nuke! [Al Gore appears out of nowhere, making like he's Superman about to land]"
2707,11,12,Al Gore,"What's going on here? [no one says a word, and he ""flies"" around a bit more] The military has to do this! It's their only way to kill ManBearPig. [""flies"" off]"
2708,11,12,Aslan,"Good, Butters. Now imagine some more archers on the castle walls!"
2709,11,12,Butters Stotch,Huwhoa! [Perseus appears on the bridge with a bad wound on his left arm]
2710,11,12,Perseus,Aslan! We're losing the battle!
2711,11,12,Robin Hood,"[with a bleeding wound on his right arm] We managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves, but... now our troops are being shot down by the Cavity Creeps."
2712,11,12,Aslan,Cavity Creeps?
2713,11,12,Cavity Creeps,[cutting through the field with their cavity drills] We make holes in teeth! We make holes in teeth!
2714,11,12,Wonder Woman,What can destroy the Cavity Creeps?
2715,11,12,Perseus,Only Crest Gel with Tartar Control.
2716,11,12,Aslan,"[to Butters] Quickly! You must imagine a giant Crest Gel! [Butters thinks, and poof! There's a giant Crest Gel tube of toothpaste with arms and legs. Robin Hood and Perseus escort it to the battlefield]"
2717,11,12,Robin Hood,Yes!
2718,11,12,Gandalf,His powers are getting stronger. We might just have a chance here.
2719,11,12,Archangel,"Aslan, we've captured a spy! He was sneaking around the Gumdrop Forest! [down from above comes the archangel with Stan]"
2720,11,12,Butters Stotch,"Stan! [points him out to Aslan and walks to him] Hey look, I imagined Stan here!"
2721,11,12,Stan Marsh,"No, no! I got sucked through Operation Imagination Doorway at the Pentagon."
2722,11,12,Aslan,Project Imagination Doorway? [no one else has a clue either]
2723,11,12,Gandalf,Never mind! The battle is almost won! We can deal with him later.
2724,11,12,Stan Marsh,"[stands next to Butters] No, no, you don't understand. There's a nuke. The government is about to level this entire place."
2725,11,12,Luke Skywalker,What?
2726,11,12,Butters Stotch,Wull why would they nuke Imaginationland?
2727,11,12,Stan Marsh,So the terrorists can't ever use it against us again.
2728,11,12,Aslan,We can get Imaginationland under control; the Chosen One just needs more time!
2729,11,12,Stan Marsh,The Chosen One?
2730,11,12,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, it turns out I'm the Key."
2731,11,12,Computer,[a female voice] Missile launch sequence initiated.
2732,11,12,General,"All right, people, I want this nuking done by the books."
2733,11,12,Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!"
2734,11,12,General,What?!
2735,11,12,Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!"
2736,11,12,General,"Sector 2? [The large window opposite the portal had been patched up, but cracks remain. Cartman crashes through the large window again, reversing the patches, and again lands on his back.]"
2737,11,12,Eric Cartman,[gets up] What the hell do you think you're doing declaring leprechauns aren't real?!
2738,11,12,General,What?
2739,11,12,Eric Cartman,You just can't declare that imaginary things aren't real! Who are you to say what's real?! Think about it: is blue real? Is love really real?
2740,11,12,Lab Tech,"Imaginary things are things made up by people, like Santa and Rudolph."
2741,11,12,Tom,"Yeah, and they detract from real things, like Jesus."
2742,11,12,Tech 1,Maybe Jesus is imaginary too.
2743,11,12,Tom,"Ooooh, you'd better not say that! You'll go to hell!"
2744,11,12,Tech 7,It's possible that hell is also imaginary.
2745,11,12,Tech 2,"Uh so then, we're about to nuke hell... that's a good thing, right?"
2746,11,12,Personnel,"[not all at once] Hell yeah, that's a good thing, yeah."
2747,11,12,Lab Tech,What if heaven is imaginary? We'd be nuking heaven.
2748,11,12,Tech 3,"Yeah, but it wouldn't be real."
2749,11,12,Lab Tech 2,So it'd be all right.
2750,11,12,Eric Cartman,"Look, maybe they're all part of the same thing. Santa and Jesus and hell and- leprechauns. Maybe they're all real in the same wway, right?"
2751,11,12,Tom,"Santa Claus and leprechauns are imaginary, but Jesus and hell are real!"
2752,11,12,Tech 3,"Well then, what about Buddha?"
2753,11,12,Tom,Well of course he's imaginary!
2754,11,12,Lab Tech 3,"Awww, see? Now you're being intolerant, Tom."
2755,11,12,Tech 7,Am I real?
2756,11,12,General,"All right, enough! Keep that kid out of the way and let's get back to the nuking at hand!"
2757,11,12,Eric Cartman,"[two guards haul him away] No! Leprechauns are real, Goddammit!"
2758,11,12,Stan Marsh,"[in Kyle's imagination] Kyle? Kyle, what happened?"
2759,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Nothing.
2760,11,12,Stan Marsh,What??
2761,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,[stands up and moves around] Nothing happened! There's nothing I can do! [a man walking by looks at him for a few seconds]
2762,11,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you can't let the government fire off that nuke!"
2763,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,They say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things aren't real!
2764,11,12,Stan Marsh,Well you have to convince them they are real!
2765,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"No way, dude, then I'd have to suck Cartman's balls"
2766,11,12,Stan Marsh,"Whatever it takes, you have to do it, all right?! [Kyle sighs] Hang- hang on, Kyle, Jesus wants to talk to you."
2767,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Huh? [POV changes. The White House is seen in the distance]
2768,11,12,Jesus Christ,"Hello, Kyle? This is Jesus."
2769,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh boy...
2770,11,12,Jesus Christ,"What seems to be the problem, my child?"
2771,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, I can't do anything. [a man walking down the steps stops to look, then continues walking.] I'm just a fourth grader going against the entire government. [Jesus falls silent] Uh, hello? Jesus?"
2772,11,12,Luke Skywalker,"No eh, hey Kyle, this is Luke Skywalker."
2773,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,[dejected] Aah.
2774,11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Look, I know this seems like an impossible task, but do you remember when I brought down the Death Star. I m, I mean, that seemed impossible too, right?"
2775,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I guess."
2776,11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Uh okay, now, now hold on, because Superman is here and he wants to say something. [Kyle rolls his eyes around]"
2777,11,12,Superman,"Kyle, this is Superman."
2778,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Hi Superman.
2779,11,12,Superman,"I know that saving people can be a big responsibility, but no matter what it takes, it's worth it."
2780,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,[subdued] I know.
2781,11,12,Superman,"You can do this, Kyle. How hang on, because Hercules wants to talk to you."
2782,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God...
2783,11,12,Superman,"Yes, God is here too. He's gonna talk to you right after Captain Crunch."
2784,11,12,Jesus Christ,"Popeye, I need some help here! [a donkey wearing a sombrero walks by shooting at the Pac-Man monsters]"
2785,11,12,Lollipop King,"[being choked by an Imperial Stormtrooper] Popeye is being killed by Christmas Critters. [sure enough, the Critters hump on Popeye as Foxy Fox pisses on his face]"
2786,11,12,Popeye,"Gaw guguh, getskug off of me!"
2787,11,12,Beary Bear,"[sees something and leaves the other Critters] Hey, what is that?"
2788,11,12,Butters Stotch,More spinach for Popeye! [ten cans of spinach appear before Popeye in a pyramid] Imagine an M60 for Jesus!
2789,11,12,Jesus Christ,[his sword turns into an M60 and the Xenomorph cowers] All right!
2790,11,12,Aslan,[on the bridge] The boy is doing it! Everything is going to be okay!
2791,11,12,Computer,Missile launch in one minute.
2792,11,12,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit, you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything!"
2793,11,12,General,Prepare for launch...
2794,11,12,Tech 1,"Sir, we have a security breach!"
2795,11,12,General,What?!
2796,11,12,Tech 3,"There's an Unauthorized Entry Alert, sir-it's coming from Sector Two!"
2797,11,12,General,Sector 2? [Kyle crashes through the part of the large window that was left intact and lands on his back. Cartman turns around]
2798,11,12,Eric Cartman,Kyle?
2799,11,12,General,The hell are you doing back here?!
2800,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Listen, you don't have to do this! Our imaginations aren't running wild anymore."
2801,11,12,General,Why is it so easy for children to break into the Pentagon?!
2802,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,You have to stop!
2803,11,12,General,"If I'm not mistaken, you're the one who bet that leprechauns weren't real. So why do you care what happens?"
2804,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Because I- [catches himself] I... Um... because I think... they are real. It's all real. Think about it. Haven't Luke Skywalker and Santa Claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room? I mean, whether Jesus is real or not, he... he's had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have. And the same could be said of Bugs Bunny and, a-and Superman and Harry Potter. They've changed my life, changed the way I act on the Earth. Doesn't that make them kind of ""real."" They might be imaginary, but, but they're more important than most of us here. And they're all gonna be around long after we're dead. So in a way, those things are more realer than any of us. [Cartman begins a slow clap, then speeds it up. The techs in the room join in and soon everyone is applauding Kyle's speech]"
2805,11,12,General,Abort the sequence. [a tech flips the switch and the power to the missile is cut. The missile lowers to a resting state]
2806,11,12,Eric Cartman,"So Kyle, imaginary things are real, huh? Guess that means I did win the bet after all. And you know what that means, Kyle. [gloats]"
2807,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Just let it go with your fucking balls, you fucking asshole!! Your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet! Well I've decided, Cartman, even if we had a bet, that I am never sucking your balls, [forces Cartman to face him] you got that?! They can throw me in jail for the rest of my life, but I am [jab] never going to suck your balls, [jab] never! So [jab] there!"
2808,11,12,Al Gore,[walking through the sliding doors] What happened?! Why hasn't the missile gone off?!
2809,11,12,General,"There's been an abort, Mr. Gore."
2810,11,12,Al Gore,[moves towards the switch] No! ManBearPig has to die! [presses buttons randomly]
2811,11,12,Tech 3,"Oh Jesus no! [the portal activates and begins sucking everyone and everything into Imaginationland, including Cartman and Kyle... and the missile]"
2812,11,12,Lollipop King,"That's it, Aslan! The evil characters have fled!"
2813,11,12,Aslan,"The day is ours! [screams are heard and bodies fall from the sky. Aslan and the others look up. Many of them land on the battlefield. Kyle lands on the bridge, face down]"
2814,11,12,Stan Marsh,[approaches] Kyle!
2815,11,12,Butters Stotch,[approaches Cartman on the battlefield] Fellas! Where'd you come from? [a whistling sound is heard and everyone looks up]
2816,11,12,Zeus,"What is that? [the missile comes down from the sky and blows up on the battlefield, killing everyone. The screen fills up with white ash. Moments later, Butters digs himself out of the ash and dusts himself off. He looks around and walks off to his left.]"
2817,11,12,Butters Stotch,"Huh... [with nothing but white around, he concentrates real hard and soon Imaginationland returns. The Barrier repairs itself, and all the imaginary characters reappear]"
2818,11,12,Jesus Christ,He did it!
2819,11,12,Fanciful Mayor,"[poof] Oh look, I'm back!"
2820,11,12,Luke Skywalker,"Nice going, kid. [the other good imaginary characters congratulate him]"
2821,11,12,Fanciful Mayor,The evil characters! They're all behind the wall again.
2822,11,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude! How did you do that, Butters?"
2823,11,12,Butters Stotch,Well I just... used my imagination.
2824,11,12,All,Awwww [everyone has a good laugh]
2825,11,12,Eric Cartman,"You know, I really have learned a lot, you guys. What Kyle said about imaginary things being real and, Butters using his imagination? It makes me think that... well maybe we all have the power to make things a reality. [he begins to think hard, and an imaginary version of himself appears, wearing the crown and robe from before.]  Why look, it's me. And... [thinks again, and an imaginary Kyle appears] And there's Kyle. And, what's Kyle about to do? [the imaginary Kyle drops out of view]"
2826,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, don't!"
2827,11,12,Eric Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle! What are you doing to my balls? OHO, look! It's Kyle sucking my balls! [the imaginary Cartman is a little shocked]"
2828,11,12,Stan Marsh,Dude.
2829,11,12,Lollipop King,Oh my God.
2830,11,12,Eric Cartman,"O-hoo Kyle, you are gobbling those balls, aren't you? I told you you would suck my balls before this was over, didn't I, Kyle?"
2831,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not sucking your balls; that's imaginary!
2832,11,12,Eric Cartman,"No- Kyle, I believe you said that imaginary things are real."
2833,11,12,General,That's true. You did.
2834,11,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh, look at you go, Kyle! Oho, you dirty girl! You LOVE those balls. [everyone but Kyle laughs]"
2835,11,12,Santa,"Okay, Kyle, that's enough ballsucking. We need to get you boys home."
2836,11,12,Kyle Broflovski,I am not sucking Cartman's balls!
2837,11,12,Fanciful Mayor,"Whatever you imagine to be real, is real. [everyone cheers that remark]"
2838,11,12,Anchorman Steven,Butters? [Butters opens his eyes] Butters!
2839,11,12,Butters Stotch,[sits up] A-huh? What? Oh! It was all just a dream.
2840,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"Come on, Butters, time to get up. [walks in with newspaper in hand]"
2841,11,12,Butters Stotch,"Oh Dad! I had the craziest dream! I, I saved all of Imaginationland from running wild after a terrorist attack!"
2842,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"You WERE in Imaginationland, Butters! We've read all about it in the paper! The question is, what were you doing in Imaginationland when you were supposed to be helping your mother clean up the basement?!"
2843,11,12,Linda Stotch,"You are grounded, mister!"
2844,11,12,Butters Stotch,"[dejected] Ohhh. [becomes determined] Wait, I'm not grounded."
2845,11,12,Anchorman Steven,Oh yes you are!
2846,11,12,Butters Stotch,"Oh yeah? [focuses real hard, then opens his eyes]"
2847,11,12,Anchorman Steven,"That only works in Imaginationland! You're grounded! [backs out of the room. He and Linda leave, closing the door behind them]"
2848,11,12,Butters Stotch,"[thinks a bit, then lies down again] Ahhh shit."
2849,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Stan, you guys are good! [Stan and Kyle more their right arms around during a power chord, then quickly return to playing. The score is 15,594 points and climbs quickly. Randy watches from the kitchen doorway]"
2850,11,13,Randy Marsh,"[sounding tired] Sharon, what are the boys doing?"
2851,11,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Stan and Kyle bought a new video game together."
2852,11,13,Randy Marsh,They can play guitar now?
2853,11,13,Sharon Marsh,"No, no, they're just little plastic controllers. You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the game play."
2854,11,13,Randy Marsh,Ohhh.
2855,11,13,Sharon Marsh,"If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish."
2856,11,13,Randy Marsh,Hey yeah...
2857,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, listen to that video crowd! They love us! [a shot of the cheering CG crowd on the TV]"
2858,11,13,Randy Marsh,"[walks up to Stan] So you boys like this music, huh?"
2859,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, dude. Its Guitar Hero."
2860,11,13,Butters Stotch,Stan and Kyle are really good at it.
2861,11,13,Randy Marsh,"Well you kids wanna see something really cool? [the boys pay attention] Check this out. [walks away and picks up an electric guitar, and plugs in the amplifier. He puts his right foot on top of the amplifier and begins to play ""Wayward Son"" a half-step up.
Once, I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high.
Though my eyes could see I-"
2862,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[irritated, interrupting] Dad? Dad! What are you doing?!"
2863,11,13,Randy Marsh,[brightly] I can actually play a lot of these songs on a real guitar. You want me to teach you boys how?
2864,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, that's gay, Mr. Marsh."
2865,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's stupid, Dad."
2866,11,13,Randy Marsh,But... But this is real.
2867,11,13,Eric Cartman,Real guitars are for old people.
2868,11,13,Craig Tucker,"Do you mind, sir? We wanna watch Stan and Kyle play. [Randy stands there a few seconds, disappointed that the boys aren't interested. He takes off the guitar, leans it against the amplifier, and walks away.]"
2869,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[turns back to the TV] Alright, let's try to score 60,000 points this time. [the game starts up with a new song, and the boys behind them begin to cheer again]"
2870,11,13,M C,"Are you ready to rock? [""Wayward Son"" begins to play from the top, and Randy begins to move, slowly raising his right hand into a victory sign, then swinging his arm all the way around a few times]"
2871,11,13,Kansas,"""Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more""
[the first guitar solo follows and Randy is playing terribly. The video crowd begins to boo him.]"
2872,11,13,M C,"Game over! You suck! [the words are displayed onscreen. Randy takes off the controller, sets it on the ground, and walks back to bed, leaving the TV on with the video crowd still booing him.]"
2873,11,13,Butters Stotch,They're gonna do it!
2874,11,13,Eric Cartman,"[so relaxed his fat blocks his chin from view] Come on, guys, a hundred thousand points!"
2875,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, shut up. We're concentrating. [the points pile up and they near 100,000. After a final flourish, their readouts combine into one, showing 100,000 points. The boys congratulate Stan and Kyle]"
2876,11,13,M C,You have broken a hundred thousand points! You. Are. Rock stars!
2877,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we are total rock stars now!"
2878,11,13,Randy Marsh,[walks in with beer and slurred speech] You're not rock stars! This is just a stupid plastic controller! [the doorbell rings]
2879,11,13,Stan Marsh,[takes off his controller and goes to answer the door] Hang on.
2880,11,13,Man,Stan Marsh?
2881,11,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
2882,11,13,Man,"I'm Charles Kincade, from the Kincade Talent Agency? I just heard you broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero."
2883,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we did. [smiles]"
2884,11,13,Mr Kincade,I'm impressed. [steps inside and gives him a business card] And I'd like to be your manager.
2885,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, really?? [smiles an open smile] Dude! Dude, Kyle, this guy wants to be our manager!"
2886,11,13,Randy Marsh,No way!
2887,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,For reals? [smiles]
2888,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing, but I think with the right label behind you, you guys could make a million points."
2889,11,13,Stan Marsh,That'd be awesome!
2890,11,13,Mr Kincade,"So, we're in business then? [Stan and Kyle look at each other, then grin as ""Wayward Son"" plays]"
2891,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Well, what do you think?"
2892,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer",I like it. That's these boys playing?
2893,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[stops the tape] No, that's Kansas. But these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on Expert Level in Co-op Mode."
2894,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","That's pretty Goddamned impressive. [rises and serves himself a drink] Alright, we'll sign them to a one-year deal. [Stan and Kyle smile to this news as Mr. Kincaid stands behind them]"
2895,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[pumps his fist] Yes! You did it, boys."
2896,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","Listen, boys, I'm having a huge celebrity party at my giant mansion tonight. Why don't you come by as my honorary new artists?"
2897,11,13,Stan Marsh,Cool! [smile openly]
2898,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,Cool! [smile openly]
2899,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Wow, this is a huge party."
2900,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","Oh yes, all the biggest stars in Colorado are here."
2901,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude, dude, that's Ron Zappolo from Channel 4 News! [Ron Zappolo is shown - an elderly gent with gray hair and mustache]"
2902,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow! Oh, and look over there, that's that Jake Jabs guy from American Furniture Warehouse commercials. [Jabs is shown with a white tiger on his lap and two women around him]"
2903,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","Everyone? Everyone, this is Stan and Kyle. They just broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero. [ooo's and applause follow. Stan and Kyle grin] Please enjoy yourselves, there's lots more coke and sex in the house."
2904,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Dude! Dude, that's Jay Cutler over there! [a football player wearing #6 is shown] Quarterback for the Denver Broncos!"
2905,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God!
2906,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer",Would you boys like to meet him?
2907,11,13,Stan Marsh,Are you serious??
2908,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","Jay, I want you to meet Stan and Kyle. They broke a hundred thousand points on Guitar Hero."
2909,11,13,Jay Cutler,"Wow, really? Nice to meet you guys."
2910,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Nice to meet you! [grins] I mean, you kind of suck, but my dad says you might be good someday."
2911,11,13,Jay Cutler,[a bit bothered] Thanks...
2912,11,13,Guest at Party,"Alex, have you seen my wife anywhere?"
2913,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer",You boys know Tom Shane from the Shane Company Diamond Store commercials?
2914,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,Do we? He's a legend!
2915,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer","You remember these boys, Tom. They're gonna break a million points live at the video arcade in a few weeks."
2916,11,13,Tom Shane,"That, would be impressive."
2917,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[takes Stan aside] Dude, we've arrived. We're super, awesome, and cool."
2918,11,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.
2919,11,13,M C,You Rock!
2920,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[clapping] All right, nice rehearsal, boys."
2921,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"D-ude, I totally miffed that middle part. Did you see that?"
2922,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, that's almost impossible."
2923,11,13,Mr Kincade,"That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there's a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don't you go with Jim and he'll help you find it. [an assistant dressed in jogging outfit joins him behind Kyle]"
2924,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, okay. Cool. [takes off his controller and follows Jim out]"
2925,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[sighs] You've got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million."
2926,11,13,Stan Marsh,Really? That'd be sweet.
2927,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[turns around and points to Stan] I think you could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he's holding you back."
2928,11,13,Stan Marsh,"What, you mean, Kyle?"
2929,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Look, you score a lot higher than him; there's no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score."
2930,11,13,Stan Marsh,"But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system."
2931,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[crosses his arms] Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowheres. Just listen to that video crowd. [a shot of the video crowd cheering] I haven't heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You've got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you're worried about your friend's feelings."
2932,11,13,Mr Kincade,"You're gonna love this kid, Stan. He's one of the best Guitar Hero players I've ever seen. Except for you, of course. [sees someone] Ah, Thad! [a boy about Stan's age approaches the table and takes a seat. He wears a controller on his back] Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis."
2933,11,13,Thad Jarvis,Sup? [an air of superiority is suggested by his tilting his head back]
2934,11,13,Mr Kincade,"That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn't that right, Thad? [puffs on a cigar]"
2935,11,13,Thad Jarvis,Yup.
2936,11,13,Mr Kincade,He doesn't even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.
2937,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?"
2938,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do. [Thad stands on his chair, swings his controller around, and puts his right foot on the table.] Check this out. [All that is heard are the clicks of plastic on plastic] Pretty damn good, huh?"
2939,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that's pretty good. But can you play ""John the Fisherman""? [Thad stops and launches into that song]"
2940,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Stan, with this kid backing you, you're gonna make Guitar Hero history."
2941,11,13,Male Diner,"Ohoh, I love this song. [the other diners seem to understand the song the clicks are supposed to be making and begin to clap]"
2942,11,13,Butters Stotch,"Wow wee, look at him go!"
2943,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters the house] Hey dude, how'd it-? [he has his new controller, but he's dismayed at what he sees. The boys look at him and the game is shut off]"
2944,11,13,Stan Marsh,"...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick."
2945,11,13,Butters Stotch,"[into his hands, in a low hoarse voice.] Uh ohhh."
2946,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up to Stan] Who is this?
2947,11,13,Stan Marsh,"This is um, Thad Jarvis."
2948,11,13,Thad Jarvis,Sup?
2949,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Ahem, wha? What's going on, Stan?"
2950,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincaid thinks I should play with Thad for a while."
2951,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,But it's our game. We bought it together.
2952,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I'll buy you out of your part."
2953,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!
2954,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Don't put this all on me, Kyle!"
2955,11,13,Eric Cartman,Oh my God this is so awesome.
2956,11,13,Stan Marsh,"You were the one that's been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing 'cause you were sick,-"
2957,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,I have been sick!
2958,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, the point is I'm never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that's true!"
2959,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[stunned for a few seconds] I guess I didn't realize it was just about the points. [drops his controller next to Stan and walks out of the house, closing the door behind him]"
2960,11,13,Craig Tucker,"Dude, this game rules."
2961,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Let's just do this, all right? [a new round begins and Stan and Thad resume playing]"
2962,11,13,Brett,Hey! You're the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin' it?
2963,11,13,Stan Marsh,"It's okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I'm supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I'm I'm stressing out."
2964,11,13,Brett,"Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress."
2965,11,13,Stan Marsh,[approaches the counter with a Guitar Hero game guide] Huh?
2966,11,13,Brett,Have you ever heard of... [pulls out a different game from under the counter] Heroin Hero?
2967,11,13,Stan Marsh,Hero-Heroin Hero?
2968,11,13,Brett,Ihit's a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You could call it the ultimate first-person shooter.
2969,11,13,Stan Marsh,And there's no score? No crowds?
2970,11,13,Brett,[his voice gets soft and mellow as he speaks] No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don't ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.
2971,11,13,The Dragon from Heroin Hero,Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.
2972,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[playing quietly] Dude, this is awesome."
2973,11,13,"Mr. Alex Hart, Producer",How are they coming?
2974,11,13,Mr Kincade,"No worries, Mr. Hart. They'll be ready for the big show in a few days"
2975,11,13,Mr Hart,"They'd better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. [walks away. On the game screen, Stan's character is missing his notes and flailing about]"
2976,11,13,Stan Marsh,Ugh. Damint.
2977,11,13,Thad Jarvis,"Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?"
2978,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[frustrated] Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play! [misses some more notes] No no, you know what?! Screw this! [the music stops] I'm not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!"
2979,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Stan, it's the song we all agreed you would play."
2980,11,13,Stan Marsh,Yeah? Well I changed my mind! We're changing the song to Cheap Trick!
2981,11,13,Thad Jarvis,No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.
2982,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah? Well you're not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music I wanna play!"
2983,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?"
2984,11,13,Stan Marsh,"We're playing what I want, and I'll select a different song!"
2985,11,13,Thad Jarvis,Yeah? Well how about this one? I quite. [drops his controller] I quit I quit I quit. [turns around and walks away] I quit I quit I quit. I quit. I quit I quit.
2986,11,13,Stan Marsh,"You know what? That's great with me, Thad, 'cause I don't need you to break a million points! I never did!"
2987,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Stan, what is the matter with you?"
2988,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can't concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! [Mr. Kincaid notices that Stan's tote bag is open and looks inside. He pulls out Heroin Hero]"
2989,11,13,Mr Kincade,What is this?
2990,11,13,Stan Marsh,Man...
2991,11,13,Mr Kincade,Are you playing Heroin Hero?
2992,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Just, just a little."
2993,11,13,Mr Kincade,"No! [stands up] Nobody plays Heroin Hero just a little! You know, you never catch the dragon!"
2994,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I know, but it mellos me out, okay?!"
2995,11,13,Mr Kincade,"You'd better pull your act together, because now you're gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!"
2996,11,13,Stan Marsh,No problem.
2997,11,13,Older Boy,"Hey, beat it, kid! We wanna play now!"
2998,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not done yet.
2999,11,13,Younger Boy,"Hey, I know you. You're Kyle Broflovski. Didn't you used to have your own Guitar Hero game system?"
3000,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,No. You're thinking of somebody else.
3001,11,13,Younger Boy,"Yeah, sure. He's the kid that scored a hundred thousand points."
3002,11,13,Older Boy,How come you're playing here now?
3003,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, just go ahead and play, alright? [gets off the stool and walks away] Leave me alone. [walks up to the bar and takes a seat] Can I get a Fresca, please?"
3004,11,13,Mick,"You're good at that game, Kid. Too good to be playing in a dump like this."
3005,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah well, I can't really afford to play anymore anyway. I'm about out of quarters."
3006,11,13,Mick,"Well look, maybe I can use some extra music playing to this thing on weekend nights. You come in, work around here a little and... maybe you can play it for free."
3007,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I appreciate what you're trying to do, Mick, but I ain't a charity case yet."
3008,11,13,Mick,"Ehhh, charity case eh, I'm just trying to help out a kid who's a little... down on his luck is all."
3009,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks, Mick."
3010,11,13,The Dragon from Heroin Hero,"Catch me. Come on, catch me. [Stan is passed out on the couch with snacks all around him. Some knocks and the doorbell are heard, but Stan doesn't move] What's wrong? Follow me. Come on. [The door opens and Mr. Kincaid comes in]"
3011,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Marsh? Stan, you got- [notices Stan passed out] Oh my God! [runs over to him and shakes him hard] Get up, Stan! Wake up!"
3012,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Huh? What, uh?"
3013,11,13,Mr Kincade,You're going on in ten minutes! Everybody's coming to see you!
3014,11,13,Stan Marsh,The dragon. Where did it go?
3015,11,13,Mr Kincade,"[slaps Stan twice across the face] You've gotta pull it together! [shakes him hard again, then sees a glass of water nearby and throws the water at him, them shakes him hard again] Pull it together, Goddammit!"
3016,11,13,Mr Kincade,Thank you for coming to Gamecraft Arcade to watch Stan Marsh break a million points and unlock superstardom. [the boys cheer Stan on.]
3017,11,13,Token Black,Go Stan!
3018,11,13,Eric Cartman,"All right, Stan, you've got it, man!"
3019,11,13,Token Black,"Yeah, Stan!"
3020,11,13,Craig Tucker,"Dude, what's the matter with him?"
3021,11,13,Butters Stotch,"He's been up for three days straight playing Heroin Hero. [Stan staggers slowly] Come on, Stan! You got it!"
3022,11,13,Mr Kincade,"Goddamnit, he's a mess! [Stan is moving around, but he's missing all the notes]"
3023,11,13,Craig Tucker,"Oh man, I can't watch this."
3024,11,13,Mr Kincade,What are you doing?! The video crowd is starting to boo! [a shot of the video crowd booing]
3025,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Come on guys. Let's get out of here. [the boys leave, as to the couples and other spectators, leaving Stan alone with Mr. Kincade. Mr. Hart approaches Mr. Kincade.]"
3026,11,13,Mr Hart,"The next time you bring me some talent, make sure they're talent-ed. [walks away. Stan stumbles and finally falls face first, throwing up]"
3027,11,13,Mr Kincade,You blew it! You had it all and you blew it! Listen to that video crowd! They hate you! [walks away. More shots of the video crowd booing. Stan looks at the crowd and begins seeing double]
3028,11,13,Brett,"There he is! So, did you break a million yet?"
3029,11,13,Stan Marsh,"No, I didn't break a million points and unlock superstardom, all right? I'm done with that stupid game!"
3030,11,13,Brett,"Aw, come on. Once you start playing Guitar Hero, you can't stop till you reach the top."
3031,11,13,Stan Marsh,I just wanna find something else to play.
3032,11,13,Brett,"Have you played... [whips out a new game] Rehab Hero? You get chased by a big dragon, but you keep running away from it."
3033,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I just want a nice, simple... driving game. How about that?"
3034,11,13,Brett,Sssure kid. Sure. [brings out a Cross Country Cruiser game]
3035,11,13,Radio Host,"All right, that was the Splendifs. And now here's a hit you all remember. It's a song that two local fourth grade boys scored a hundred thousand points to on Guitar Hero. [Stan is startled] Don't know whatever happened to those boys. I Guess... they're not playing the game anymore."
3036,11,13,Skid Row,"""Woke up to the sound of pouring rain
The wind would whisper and I'd think of you
And all the tears you cried, that called my name
[Stan walks in and approaches Kyle. Kyle sees him and turns his back to him]
And when you needed me I came through"""
3037,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, could I just talk to you for like five minutes?"
3038,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you doing here? [""I paint a picture of the days gone by""]"
3039,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Please, ih ih, it won't take long."
3040,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit. We're gonna take a short break. Be back in five. [""When love went blind and you would make me see."" Kyle walks over to the bar and serves himself some Fresca]"
3041,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I was listening to you for a while. Dude, you've gotten a lot better. [""I'd stare a lifetime into your eyes""]"
3042,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, thank you! I was so eagerly awaiting your approval of my abilities! [""So that I knew you were there for me""]"
3043,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Look, Kyle, the game is still set up at my house and, maybe we could go try playing it again over there."
3044,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, so the gallant knight now comes to rescue me from the bowels of mediocrity! Oh, thank you, your royal lordship! [""Time after time you were there for me""]"
3045,11,13,Stan Marsh,"That isn't it at all. [""Remember yesterday - walking hand in hand""]"
3046,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't get it, Stan! I can play here all I want. I even get free Frescas. I don't need you anymore! [""Love letters in the sand - I remember you""]"
3047,11,13,Stan Marsh,"I know. I need you. [Kyle glances over his shoulder, then turns around to face Stan] I thought I was having a great time because I was getting signed by managers and, going to big sex and coke parties, but, then I realized, I was having fun because I was doing all that... [turns around and face Kyle] ...with my best friend."
3048,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"It was pretty fun, wasn't it?"
3049,11,13,Stan Marsh,[awkwardly] Yeah.
3050,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, I doubt we could break a million together anyway."
3051,11,13,Stan Marsh,I don't care. I'd just like to play with you again. For the fun of it.
3052,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,I don't really see the fun in... [turns around with fire in his eyes] ...not trying to kick that game's ass once and for all!
3053,11,13,Stan Marsh,"What, you mean it?"
3054,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I think we can do it, Stan. I've been close to a million a few times by myself."
3055,11,13,Stan Marsh,"[pats Kyle on the shoulder] Then let's go, dude! [walks forward. Kyle follows.]"
3056,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops abruptly] Oh wait. Wait, I'm supposed to play here. [turns around and face Mick] Hey, Mick, w-would you mind if I stepped out for a sec?"
3057,11,13,Mick,"Go on, get out of here, kid. Who needs your wailin' and rockin' around here anyways?"
3058,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks, Mick! [turns left and walks out. Stan follows him.]"
3059,11,13,Stan Marsh,"All right, dude, let's do this. [Kyle's jaw drops and Stan is annoyed] What the hell? [what greets them is Randy on the couch in his underwear. Around him are a pizza slice, a bucket of chicken, a case of S'mores Schnapps, and other items. Randy is playing Heroin Hero]"
3060,11,13,Randy Marsh,"Ahhh, Ahhhhhhh."
3061,11,13,The Dragon from Heroin Hero,"Come on, come on. You almost got me. Catch me. Come on."
3062,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Aw Goddammit! Dad, get off our Xbox!"
3063,11,13,Randy Marsh,"Hang on, I almost caught the dragon."
3064,11,13,The Dragon from Heroin Hero,"Hehe, you almost caught me."
3065,11,13,Stan Marsh,"No, me and Kyle are gonna play Guitar Hero!"
3066,11,13,Randy Marsh,[sits up] I can get him! Wait! Where's he going now?
3067,11,13,Stan Marsh,"You don't ever catch the dragon, Dad! [turns off the console]"
3068,11,13,Randy Marsh,NOO! NOOO I SAID! I AM YOUR FATHER! PUT IT BACK ON!
3069,11,13,Stan Marsh,"Mom, will you get Dad out of here?"
3070,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Stop cheating, Craig! [pushes Craig from behind]"
3071,11,13,Craig Tucker,How was that cheating!
3072,11,13,Eric Cartman,"'Cause you tricked me, you black asshole!"
3073,11,13,Butters Stotch,Fellas! Fellas! They're gonna do it!
3074,11,13,Eric Cartman,What?
3075,11,13,Butters Stotch,"Stan and Kyle! They're about to break a million on Guitar Hero, and unlock superstardom! [Butters runs back. After some thought, the other boys run after him]"
3076,11,13,The Boys,"Oh, let's go! Cone on, let's go!"
3077,11,13,Butters Stotch,They're gonna do it! [they finally break the million]
3078,11,13,Craig Tucker,They did it!
3079,11,13,Jimmy Valmer,Oh my sweet J-Jesus!
3080,11,13,M C,You have played Guitar Hero enough to reach one million points! Congratulations! You. Are. FAGS. [the video crowd cheers]
3081,11,13,Stan Marsh,That's it?
3082,11,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddammit! God dammit! [walks away pissed off. Stan takes off his controller and looks at it, drops it to the floor, and follows after Kyle]"
3083,11,13,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you wanna play me next? [picks up Stan's controller and puts it on]"
3084,11,13,Butters Stotch,"Heh, okay, but I get to be the one that betrays you after the sex and drug party. [picks up Kyle's controller and puts it on, and both of them get to playing.]"
3085,11,14,Butters Stotch,[runs towards the table breathlessly] Fellas! Fellas! It's- Oh my god! You're not gonna believe this!
3086,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Butters, calm down."
3087,11,14,Butters Stotch,"Okay. [takes a gulp of air and looks around] Okay. I was talking to Pete Wetchney, and he said that Danny Chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boy's looks from cutest to ugliest."
3088,11,14,Craig Tucker,So who do they say is the cutest?
3089,11,14,Butters Stotch,I dunno.
3090,11,14,Token Black,Who do they say is the ugliest?
3091,11,14,Butters Stotch,"I don't know. I-it's like a girl thing. They won't let anybody see the list but them. [turns around and looks at them. The other boys look as well. Nearby, the girls chat among themselves, notice the boys, then laugh. Bebe holds up a notebook]"
3092,11,14,Eric Cartman,[mad] They can't do that. Who are they to judge us on how we look?
3093,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. You think they rate us just for looks, or they take personality into account?"
3094,11,14,Clyde Donovan,If it's just looks then I think I'm safe.
3095,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, who cares if the girls make some stupid list? Girls make dumb lists all the time."
3096,11,14,Eric Cartman,"[with a double cheeseburger in his left hand] Yeah, Kyle's right. Screw it; we have better things to worry about."
3097,11,14,Craig Tucker,You're just saying that because you know you're gonna be very last on the list!
3098,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh please, I don't think so, Craig! Chicks think I'm way hotter than you!"
3099,11,14,Craig Tucker,You don't think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom?
3100,11,14,Eric Cartman,"No, because chicks know I'm not fat, I'm buff! They probably put you at the bottom of the list 'cause you have fucked-up teeth! Or Kenny 'cause he's poor."
3101,11,14,Kenny McCormick,"(They didn't put me at the bottom, did they?)"
3102,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, face it: Girls don't wanna eat Pop Tarts for dinner every night when they get married."
3103,11,14,Butters Stotch,"You don't think they said I'm the ugliest boy in the class, do ya? Well if they did, my parents will ground me."
3104,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks?! [the boys look at each other for a few seconds]"
3105,11,14,Eric Cartman,"All right, Bebe, let's see the list."
3106,11,14,Bebe Stevens,[turns her head to look at him] What?
3107,11,14,Eric Cartman,"You know what I'm talking about, bitch! The list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class!"
3108,11,14,Bebe Stevens,That's not for boys to look at! It's a secret girl list and YOU can't see it!
3109,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Craig is on the bottom, right? Or is it Kenny 'cause you'd be eating Pop Tarts for dinner if you married him?"
3110,11,14,Bebe Stevens,"I'm not... [slams her locker door shut] telling! And anyway, I'm not the list keeper, Nelly is! And Nelly will never let you look at it, so there! [sticks her tongue out and blows a raspberry at him, then walks away]"
3111,11,14,Eric Cartman,"[blows a strong raspberry back and flips her off] Fuck you, Bebe! Fuck it, bitch!"
3112,11,14,Butters Stotch,"[disappointed] Well, I guess we're never gonna get that list from the girls."
3113,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Screw that, dude! We're guys. We can out think them."
3114,11,14,Eric Cartman,"All right, here's what we know. That chick Nelly is the one who's in charge of holding the list, right? She apparently keeps it in a purple Pee Chee folder, and we need a plan to get it from her. [points to a chalkboard with his plan on it] This is what I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail"". [a map with routes of the plan laid out]"
3115,11,14,Butters Stotch,[happily taking notes] Neat-o!
3116,11,14,Eric Cartman,"At 1 PM tomorrow, Nelly will have to walk from Home Ec to Social Studies. That's our best time to strike. As she makes her way through Hallway 3, Craig will be ready with a distraction device here. [upper center part of the map] When she stops and turns to Craig in the hallway, Butters will run up and kick her in the balls."
3117,11,14,Butters Stotch,[cheerfully] Okay!
3118,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Once Butters kicks her in the balls, she'll fall to the floor, dropping the Pee Chee, and Kenny will swoop in from Corridor 3-Delta, and grab the Pee Chee. Are we good?"
3119,11,14,Nelly,"Ow! What'dja do that for?! [Butters looks down and kicks her in the groin again] Hey, what's your problem, asshole?! [Butters is stunned that his kicks have no effect on her]"
3120,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Bail, bail! [he and Kenny take off]"
3121,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Okay, our mission failed, but we've learned a lot. Primarily that girls do not have balls."
3122,11,14,Butters Stotch,[shown with a black right eye and his right arm in a sling] They sure don't.
3123,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Never mind, because we are going to Plan B, one that I call ""Operation: Cannot Possibly Fail A Second Time"". When Nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess, Kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground."
3124,11,14,Butters Stotch,You think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies?
3125,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Butters, we're done talkin' about girls' balls right now! Pay attention! [continues]"
3126,11,14,Eric Cartman,We got it! We got it! [next shot is of Stan at his locker as Craig runs by]
3127,11,14,Craig Tucker,"We got the list from the girls! [the other boys take pursuit: Stan, Token, Jimmy, Clyde, Tweek, Bill, and two others. Two sixth graders and some kindergartners watch from the far end of the hall]"
3128,11,14,Nelly,[chasing after the boys] Give that back you dirty buttholes! [the boys run into the boys' room]
3129,11,14,Eric Cartman,"Tape it to the wall, Kenny! Jason, watch the door! [Kyle is washing his hands, but he turns to see what's going on]"
3130,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"All right, hurry! Get it up there! Let's see it!"
3131,11,14,A Boy,Hurry hurry!
3132,11,14,Craig Tucker,"Whoa, what's this thing? Where am I?"
3133,11,14,Clyde Donovan,What number am I on?
3134,11,14,A Boy,Is it set up?
3135,11,14,Stan Marsh,It's listed in order from cutest to ugliest. Clyde's number one.
3136,11,14,Clyde Donovan,Me? [smiles] I'm the cutest? [grins]
3137,11,14,Stan Marsh,"And then Token, and then me."
3138,11,14,Token Black,I'm number two? Wow.
3139,11,14,Butters Stotch,"[making his way to the front] Come on, let me see! Let me see! [looks at the list and begins to scan it for his own name, then finds it] Oh boy! I'm number 11! Whoopie! Number 11! [runs out of the bathroom as a few boys wonder why he's so happy about it]"
3140,11,14,Craig Tucker,"Ah! Look at that! I'm hotter than you, fatso! [he's #12 while Cartman is #15]"
3141,11,14,Eric Cartman,What?! That's bullcrap! [Kenny moves up past Cartman and looks for his name. He finds himself at #7]
3142,11,14,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!) [moves off]
3143,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, so big deal, guys! Do you feel better now? Clyde's the best looking kid in the class. And then Token and Stan, and last is Francis, Cartman, and... [finds himself at #16, the last one on the list. His head drops a little] Me?"
3144,11,14,Eric Cartman,"You're last, dude! [laughs heartily]"
3145,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,No way.
3146,11,14,Eric Cartman,Yes way! Check it out! [laughs heartily]
3147,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, lay off! You're next to last."
3148,11,14,Eric Cartman,So? I'm hotter than Kyle. [makes his way through the crowd and out of the bathroom] I'm better looking than Kyyyle! [the other boys join him out except for Stan and Kyle] Yes! I'm hotter than Kyyyle! I'm hotter than Kyyyle!
3149,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,I'm last? Last?
3150,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's just a stupid list, remember?"
3151,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,I got voted the ugliest boy in the whole class?
3152,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Who cares what dumb girls think, right? [realizes there's no consolation now and walks away. Kyle stays there looking at the list. Alone. All alone. All alone in the boys' room]"
3153,11,14,Butters Stotch,"Mom, Dad! I'm not the ugliest kid in the class! Kyle Broflovski is!"
3154,11,14,Stephen Stotch,"[holding a smoking pipe with his right hand and reading the Denver Post] Well good for you, Butters."
3155,11,14,Linda Stotch,"Way to go, champ."
3156,11,14,Butters Stotch,Whoopie! [flies off to his room]
3157,11,14,Stephen Stotch,"Well, guess we don't have to ground him."
3158,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, what's the matter? You barely touched your knishes."
3159,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,The... girls at school. They made a list and voted me the ugliest boy.
3160,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,What? That's ridiculous. My little bubbeleh is adorable!
3161,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Look, I know I'm not the best-looking guy in town, but I-I didn't think I was the very ugliest."
3162,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,"You're not ugly, Kyle. You're my perfect little man. You look just like your father. [Gerald looks at Kyle and flashes a smile]"
3163,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Oh God! I do?
3164,11,14,Gerald Broflovski,But he has his mother's nose.
3165,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,[slaps both hands on his own nose] Ah!
3166,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, you are very handsome and perfect in every way."
3167,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, Ike, you have to be honest. Am I ugly, yes or no? [Ike looks at him, then at their parents, then back at him. Kyle takes this to mean yes, and so leaves his chair] You ALL think I'm ugly. Jesus Christ, the least you could have done is told me!"
3168,11,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, come back here! [a door slams shut]"
3169,11,14,Eric Cartman,"I'm better looking than you! [knocks on the window again] The girls think I'm better looking than you, Kyle! [Kyle sighs, stands on his bed, and pulls on a drawstring to close the curtains. Cartman moves with the curtain until he can no longer see inside Kyle's room] Dude, Kyle! Can you hear me? They totally think I'm hotter than you are! [knocks] Kyle! Kyle, I'm more attractive! [knocks again. The curtain is fully closed and Kyle goes back to sleep] Kyle?"
3170,11,14,Betsy Donovan,"[checking in on Clyde] Clyde, it's time to be getting to bed. [Clyde looks at his mom, who closes the door, then turns back to the mirror]"
3171,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"[raises his right eyebrow and knits his left one, then strikes a pose] Hey, what's goin' on? [looks at himself from the side] What's goin' on? Hey. [checks out his ass and then strikes another pose] Oh yeah, hey, whassup? What's goin' on? Nice."
3172,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
3173,11,14,Two Girls,Hey Clyde.
3174,11,14,Clyde Donovan,Hey.
3175,11,14,Anne,Hi Clyde.
3176,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"What's goin' on? [Kyle is dismayed, but he hears Butters running up to him]"
3177,11,14,Butters Stotch,[laughing] Hey ugly! [runs off. Kyle then walks forward]
3178,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"[stops him] Hey, Kyle. Look man, it doesn't matter what people think, okay? [Kyle remains sad] You know, Abraham Lincoln was super ugly too, but look what he accomplished. [Kyle is no happier] Chin up, cowboy. [leaves to talk to a girl nearby] Hey, what's goin' on? [the girl smiles]"
3179,11,14,Blond Girl,"Oh, not much, just hanging around-"
3180,11,14,Butters Stotch,"[returns to taunt Kyle some more] Hehehe. Hey, nice... nice ears, haha. Pizza Face! [runs off laughing]"
3181,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"Butters, that's not cool, man. [takes off after him] He can't help how he looks. [the girl walks away]"
3182,11,14,Eric Cartman,"[walks up] Kyle, I was going to suggest that maybe you should... hang out with the other ugly kids in the school. Because if you hang out with them, you won't stand out so much. Right? [Kyle stays mum, as before] Cool. [walks away. A few seconds later, Kyle's eyes pop open]"
3183,11,14,Blonde Boy,Hey.
3184,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hello. [the girl takes a sip of her milk, then lowers the carton]"
3185,11,14,Bushy Eyebrows Boy,"[with bushy eyebrows] Are you going to eat your pickle? [Kyle just picks it up and hands it to him. The boy takes it and starts eating it, slowly]"
3186,11,14,Craig Tucker,Could somebody toss the football back? It's over there next to the ugly kids. [the ugly kids just watch quietly. Kyle is more and more depressed]
3187,11,14,Big Eared Boy,I hate coming to this school. It makes me angry.
3188,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah.
3189,11,14,Big Eared Boy,Sometimes I just want to burn it down. Burn the whole school down to the ground!
3190,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[leans away, then stands up] No. You know what? Screw this! We aren't ugly!"
3191,11,14,Fat Girl,We're not?
3192,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"No! Maybe we all just need a little image change, you know? Like a makeover."
3193,11,14,Bushy Eyebrows Boy,Hey yeah.
3194,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[to the girl wearing glasses] Like you! Maybe you just need to let your hair down. And let's see how you look without those glasses. [removes them, and is met with tiny little eyes. The girl smiles after a few seconds] Let's just... put those back on. [puts them back on the girl, goes back to the steps, sits down and buries his head in his arms with a sigh. A few seconds later, Stan walks by and stops. He looks at the group helplessly. A few seconds later, he walks up to the merry-go-round, where Wendy, Lola, and Red are chatting]"
3195,11,14,Lola,"I know, that song is so awesome. [Red notices him]"
3196,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Uh, Wendy. Could I talk to you?"
3197,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Of course, Stan. [the other two girls smile]"
3198,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Just for a minute. Over here. [takes her aside, to a tree nearby]"
3199,11,14,Lola,[to Red] You think he's gonna beg her to come back to him?
3200,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,This is a nice surprise. I thought you were never speaking to me again.
3201,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah well, I wanna talk to you about this list you girls made."
3202,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,Which one? We make lists all the time.
3203,11,14,Stan Marsh,"The one where you rated the boys' looks in the class. Look, it really messed Kyle up, okay? How could you vote him the ugliest?"
3204,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"[walks off a bit] Well, personally, I didn't vote him the ugliest. My vote was for Eric Cartman. But enough of the other girls must have felt he was-"
3205,11,14,Stan Marsh,[walks up next to her] So it wasn't unanimous. Maybe you can just change the list.
3206,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,Change the list?! Do you have any idea what that would take?! Maybe you don't understand how important list-making is to girls! It's not just something we do flippantly! There's protocol!
3207,11,14,Stan Marsh,Can't we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted Kyle last?
3208,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"[thinks for a moment] All right, I'll try and get you into our next list-making meeting. But it won't be easy."
3209,11,14,Bebe Stevens,"Today's list meeting is called to order. Rebecca, you have the floor."
3210,11,14,Red,If it pleases and sparkles I suggest we continue deliberations on List 47D: Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse?
3211,11,14,Bebe Stevens,Rebecca moves we work on List 47D. Does that sparkle with all the girls?
3212,11,14,Girls,Sunshine.
3213,11,14,Lola,"Deliberating ""Which Girl Has The Cutest Purse""? Millie has the floor."
3214,11,14,Millie Larsen,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to submit that [motions to her left] Jennifer's purse is by far the cutest. Definitely cuter than Teresa's."
3215,11,14,Blond Girl,"I don't think anyone here disagrees that Jennifer's purse is cuter than Teresa's, but it doesn't make it the cutest."
3216,11,14,Bebe Stevens,The committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the Top 5 cutest purses.
3217,11,14,Lola,Sunshine sparkle. Wendy has the floor.
3218,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"If it pleases and sparkles, I would like to suggest that we... [glances at Stan] That we reopen last week's list for debate."
3219,11,14,Girls,[debating] What'd she say? She's gotta be kidding!
3220,11,14,Heidi Turner,Is she crazy?
3221,11,14,Bebe Stevens,"All right, all right, come before the Rainbow Railing. [Stan and Wendy walk into the center of the room]"
3222,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,Go ahead.
3223,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Aaah, I was just thinking that maybe you voted a little... hastily on the cutest boy?"
3224,11,14,Red,You thought you should be number one?
3225,11,14,Stan Marsh,NO.
3226,11,14,Bebe Stevens,Let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee!
3227,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,He didn't mean that. He was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion.
3228,11,14,Bebe Stevens,"I cannot by Sparkle Law move to have an old list investigated. However, if you can find recourse for such an inquiry, Wendy, I would review it. Does that sparkle with all the girls?"
3229,11,14,Girls,Sunshine.
3230,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,They all laugh at me! [flicks on] And the girls giggle behind my back! [flicks off] unable to even glance at my disfigured face.
3231,11,14,A Voice,"Do not burn down the school, Kyle. [Kyle looks around]"
3232,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Who said that?
3233,11,14,A Voice,I did. [a body appears in the room to match the voice - it's Abraham Lincoln's glowing ghost] Do you know who I am?
3234,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Abraham Lincoln?
3235,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"I am Abraham Lincoln. Burning down the school will not solve your problems. You think you've been cheated because you are ugly, but I am here to show you otherwise. Come! There is much to see. [walks out] I want you to look in here. [they approach a random house and look inside. A bored woman is playing with a pencil and pebble at her small dining table] This woman is Nancy Pinkerton. As a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school. Her life as a youth was filled with praises, and everything being handed to her. Boys told her she was special. She was funny. She was interesting. But that's only because she was hot. It wasn't until she reached age 40, when her looks started to fade, that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special, as a wet carrot. [they leave her as they found her, playing with a pencil, all alone in her dining room. They move on to the next house] This is the home of your new ugly friend, Yamal. [Yamal is shown playing a piano] Because he's ugly, he gets nothing handed to him. He has to work at making something of himself. But that work is gonna pay off when he's an adult. He will have character, something that kids who are hot rarely develop. Like your classmate, Clyde. [they approach Clyde's house. Clyde is all cool laying on his couch talking to someone on the phone] Now that he knows he's good-looking, he doesn't have to make any effort to be special."
3236,11,14,Clyde Donovan,"Naw, Rebecca's just a friend. I wanna be with you now. Sure, yeah, I'll buy you some shoes too."
3237,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Now his life will be about girls. Chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes. He will most likely marry very young, and not realize until age 40 that he's a total douche. And so you see, Kyle, it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed."
3238,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,But I can't wait to be an adult to be happy. That's forever from now.
3239,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,You must be patient.
3240,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Just take me home! I don't wanna be here anymore! Take me home!
3241,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,[sighs] Very well.
3242,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Kyle, you need to think about what I've told you."
3243,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,I don't want to! I don't want anybody telling me how to feel anymore!
3244,11,14,Abraham Lincoln,"Well then you're just a fucking asshole! [drives off. Kyle, stunned at that comment, just looks on.]"
3245,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Wait a minute. Wait, Stan, I think I've got something! [Stan gets off the chair and walks up to the desk] Take a look at this: during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy, seven girls gave Clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle."
3246,11,14,Stan Marsh,I have no idea what you're talking about.
3247,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"It doesn't add up. It is possible that Rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list. [they look at each other, smiling]"
3248,11,14,Red,"Oh, hey Wendy."
3249,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,Hey Rebecca. Do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys' looks?
3250,11,14,Red,"[laughs it off] Oho Wendy, we're done with that list."
3251,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"I know, but I think there's been a mistake. Six of the girls I've talked to didn't vote Clyde the cutest. That means that mathematically he should have been-"
3252,11,14,Red,"[menacingly] All right, you need to stop. Digging. Around, Wendy! [looks around to make sure no one else is listening] You might not like... what you find! [begins to draw close to her] Just back off and stop asking questions! [in Wendy's face] You're getting close to a secret that I don't think you can handle! Let it... go! [backs up into her house and closes the door]"
3253,11,14,Stan Marsh,"That didn't sparkle with her, did it?"
3254,11,14,Clerk,"[the name tag says Jerry] One canister of propane, six cans of lighter fluid, [Kyle stands there with determination in his eyes] seven gallons of high-octane kerosene, and a box of matches. [the total is $82.32] Okay, is that everything, little boy?"
3255,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,[determined] That should just about do it.
3256,11,14,Jerry,Do you like to put this on your True-Value card today?
3257,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Nonorary Chair, Mrs. Secretary, I believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists. I've compiled a full report, and it turns out that nobody voted Claude the cutest in the class. I believe Rebecca changed the list to make him number one."
3258,11,14,Lola,Why would she do that?
3259,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Right after the list was made, Rebecca started going out with Clyde. You can read all the discrepancies here. [drops the report on the table] We need to remake that list. [the girls look at the list as Wendy returns to Stan]"
3260,11,14,Jenny Simons,You just couldn't let it go! [puts her left hand on the report]
3261,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"Uh, what do you mean? Call the girls in."
3262,11,14,Jenny Simons,"I'm afraid we can't do that, Wendy! [the other girl leaves the table]"
3263,11,14,Lola,"Did you know, Wendy, that Clyde's father owns the shoe store at the mall? A lot of us have always wanted to date Clyde to get free shoes, but we couldn't, because he wasn't popular enough."
3264,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,[points at her] You knew!
3265,11,14,Lola,"[pulls out a folder] Unfortunately, the members voted Clyde in the bottom five of the list! That's why we had to manipulate the votes, forge a new list, and... hide the real one!"
3266,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,So that you all could justify dating Clyde and get shoes?! How dare you take advantage of your position! I'm gonna tell Bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee!
3267,11,14,Jenny Simons,Bebe?! Who do you think authorized the buyout?!
3268,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,[stunned that her best friend was in on this] No. Not Bebe.
3269,11,14,Jenny Simons,She's dating Clyde now. Nobody loves shoes more than her.
3270,11,14,Stan Marsh,What's going on?
3271,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"When the other girls find out you ignored their votes, they're gonna-"
3272,11,14,Jenny Simons,"Do you really think they'll believe you over the heads of the committee?! We'll simply generate a new list! ""Biggest Liars""! And put you at the top!"
3273,11,14,Lola,"Do yourself a favor, Wendy! Just let it go! And keep your little mouth shut!"
3274,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"I don't think so! [goes up and kicks Lola in the groin, hard, much to Stan's shock]"
3275,11,14,Lola,"[doubling over, dropping the folder] AAGH!"
3276,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,"[grabs the folder and runs away] Stan, run!"
3277,11,14,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, dude! [runs out after her. The two other girls give chase]"
3278,11,14,Stan Marsh,"[breathlessly] Hey, kid, have you seen Kyle? We've looked everywhere and we have to show him something."
3279,11,14,Yamal,[waits a second or two] He's burning down the school.
3280,11,14,Wendy Testaburger,What?
3281,11,14,Yamal,He said he gonna burn the school down to the ground.
3282,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[on the school roof pouring lighter fluid out] All the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over! Are you happy now, God?! YOU made me look like this!"
3283,11,14,Stan Marsh,"[he and Wendy reach the roof and run up to him] Kyle! Kyle, don't!"
3284,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't try and stop me, Stan! You don't know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity!"
3285,11,14,Stan Marsh,"The list was a forgery, Kyle!"
3286,11,14,Kyle Broflovski,Huh??
