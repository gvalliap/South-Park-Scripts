0,19,1,Mr Mackey,"Alright parents and students, please take your seats. [A gleeful Randy crumples a sheet of paper into a ball and throws it at him as Sharon looks on. The crumpled up paper strikes Mr. Mackey, who tries to deflect it and gets annoyed] Okay, okay. Now as you know, There was an incident at the school last week involving a student referring to rape as a ""hot Cosby,"" okay? [everyone laughs. Cartman looks around, smiling] Listen, listen! Principal Victoria has been fired!"
1,19,1,Various adults,What? Fired?
2,19,1,Eric Cartman,Sweet dude!
3,19,1,Mr Mackey,"And a new person has been appointed to try and make South Park Elementary a more... progressive place that... fits in with today's times. Heh ukay? So please welcome... PC Principal. [a burly man holding a sports bottle walks through the cafeteria. He sports a goatee, a hint of a mustache, and Oakley sunglasses. He swallows the last of the drink and throws the bottle off to one side]"
4,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Alright, listen up. My name is PC Principal. I don't know about you, but frankly I'm sick and tired of how minority groups are marginalized in today's society. I'm here because this place is lost in a time warp! Students who still use the word ""retarded""! A teacher who said women without wombs should get an AIDS test!"
5,19,1,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I was a [takes his right wrist and flips it forward] lesbian then."
6,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"A chef ""person of color"" who the children had sing soul songs and who the children drove to kill himself!"
7,19,1,Butters Stotch,"No, he got brainwashed by a cult."
8,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"[aims his left index finger at Butters] And that's two days' detention for you, young man! We'll see you at 4!"
9,19,1,Butters Stotch,What??
10,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Let me ask you this. We're in Colorado, right?! Where are the Hispanic kids?! Huh?! Where are the ethnic and racial minorities?!"
11,19,1,Mr Mackey,"Well, we have Token; he's black."
12,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"[aims his left index finger at Mr. Mackey] And that's two days' detention for you, Mackey! Congratulations!"
13,19,1,Mr Mackey,Wha- I got detention?
14,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"I Googled South Park before I came here, and I cannot believe the shit you're getting away with! People claiming to be advocates of transgender rights, but really just wanting to use the women's bathroom! [Sharon and Stan look at Randy] A white man who thinks he's Chinese and built a wall to keep out Mongolians."
15,19,1,Tuong Lu Kim,Ohhhh I hate-a Mongorians!
16,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"What the fuck is this?! Are you fucking kidding me?! I'm telling you all, this is done! Like it or not, PC is back, and it's bigger than ever! Weoo-weoo-weoo You hear that?! That's the sound of 2015 pulling you over, people! Suck it! [holds his right arm out and lets the mic drop to the floor from his hand]"
17,19,1,Stan Marsh,"[looking around] Man, I guess things are going to be different around here."
18,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,You know what? I think it's good. Let's face it: this is long overdue.
19,19,1,Butters Stotch,"[runs up to the other three] Did you guys hear? Cartman got four days' detention, for calling Heidi Turner ""clitty litter""!"
20,19,1,Kenny McCormick,(Really?)
21,19,1,Butters Stotch,"But the thing is, Eric isn't even fightin' it. It's like he's all sad and scared."
22,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,Good! He should be sad and scared! These things do matter and I already feel better to be at a school where we can start to have a dialogue and talk about this stuff.
23,19,1,Mr Mackey,"[over the P.A. system] Will uh, Kyle Broflovski report to the principal's office immediately? Uhkay? Kyle Broflovski. [Kyle walks off] Did I, did I say that all right?"
24,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Uhm, hi, I'm Gerald, Kyle Broflovski's father."
25,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Have a seat. I've been talking with your child, and we're gonna be giving him two weeks' detention."
26,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,"[to Kyle, in a hushed voice] Wull, what's this about, Kyle?"
27,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Your son said some things to a fourth-grade girl that frankly make me wanna puke! Now that I'm principal, I'm not gonna allow [pounds the desk with his left fist] anyone at this school to be made feel unsafe and harassed!"
28,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,Wh-wh-what did he say?
29,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"[takes off his sunglasses] You'll have to excuse my language. [picks up a report and clears his throat] ""I don't think Caitlyn Jenner is a hero."" [no reaction from Gerald or Kyle. PC Principal gets ready to erupt] This kind of transphobic and [pounds the desk with his left fist] bigoted hate speech isn't gonna fly here, bro! Well I though we were all on board that Caitlyn Jenner is an amazing, [quickly stands up] beautiful woman who had the exquisite bravery of a butterfly flying against the wind. And then this shit comes out of people's mouths!"
30,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,"PC Principal, I, I'm sure Kyle was just referring to Bruce Jenner as a person, and not trying to say anything against-"
31,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,You got a fuckin' problem bro?!
32,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,No...
33,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"'Cause it's not Bruce fuckin' Jenner! It's Caitlyn, and she's a fuckin' stunning woman! Or maybe you're the one teaching him to demean women in the first place! HUH?! What's up?! What's fuckin' up, bro?"
34,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Look, maybe we can all just ta-"
35,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Get the fuck out of here, dude! [turns the desk over, sending papers all over the place]"
36,19,1,Gerald and Kyle,"[alarmed] Aaah! [Gerald takes Kyle and they both rush to the door, open it, and rush out]"
37,19,1,Randy Marsh,"I mean, who the hell does this guy think he is? Some college kid's gonna come in and tell us our ways are old?"
38,19,1,Stuart McCormick,"Yeah. And, you can't bully our kids like that."
39,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,Kyle's already got two weeks of detention.
40,19,1,Stephen Stotch,Huh for what?!
41,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,Just 'cause he said something about Caitlyn Jenner. [a hush falls over the table]
42,19,1,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, Caitlyn Jenner. she's a hero. She is stunning and brave."
43,19,1,Stuart McCormick,"Stunning. She is absolutely beautiful, and an inspiration."
44,19,1,Ryan Valmer,Yup!
45,19,1,Randy Marsh,"Yup, that's right."
46,19,1,Gerald Broflovski,Well what the hell were you guys talki-
47,19,1,Ryan Valmer,"we've gotta be careful, Gerald. This is a college bar."
48,19,1,PC Bro 1,Somebody here have a problem with Caitlyn Jenner?
49,19,1,Ryan Valmer,No.
50,19,1,PC Bro 1,"No? 'Cause she's a stunning, beautiful woman, and if you wanna call her anything else I'm ready to fuckin' throw down!"
51,19,1,Stuart McCormick,"No no, we're totally fine with it."
52,19,1,PC Bro 2,"Weoo-weoo-weoo-weoo-weoo! [walks up waving his left hand over his head like a police siren] It? Did somebody just refer to Caitlyn Jenner as ""it""? I'm PC, bro. I'll throw down!"
53,19,1,PC Bro 1,Sweet. You're PC bro?
54,19,1,PC Bro 2,"Yeah, Arizona State."
55,19,1,PC Bro 1,"Sweet, bro. I'm PC UMass."
56,19,1,PC Bro 2,"Fuck yeah! Sweet, dude! [holds up his left hand open]"
57,19,1,PC Bro 1,"[clasps the other guy's left hand with his own] Sweet! [releases the grip] So, do we have a fuckin' problem here?"
58,19,1,Stephen Stotch,No! Caitlyn Jenner is the bravest woman in America.
59,19,1,PC Bro 3,"Weoo-eoowoo-eoowoo-oo! [walks up waving his right hand over his head like a police siren] Did someone here just say ""America"" in a way that ""other-izes"" and demeans the people of Latin and South America?!"
60,19,1,PC Bro 2,"Nice, dude. You PC?"
61,19,1,PC Bro 3,"Yeah, Chino Hills. [to the seated men] You think Venezuelans aren't Americans, brah?!"
62,19,1,PC Bro 2,"Yeah, you wanna make fun of me?!"
63,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"[notices the commotion and walks up] Hey! What seems to be the problem here, gentlemen?!"
64,19,1,PC Bro 1,Who the hell are you?!
65,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,I'm PC Principal.
66,19,1,PC Bro 2,Oh nice. We're all PC too.
67,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,No way! There's more PC bros here?
68,19,1,PC Bro 4,"Yeah dude, Ohio State."
69,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Sweet, bros. Texas A&M. Bro, I had no idea there were like-minded individuals in this town that defended social minorities. We should all hang out."
70,19,1,PC Bro 1,We should totally hang out.
71,19,1,PC Bro 4,We should all get a house together and unite our tolerant views.
72,19,1,PC Bro 1,"Fuckin' do it, dude!"
73,19,1,PC Bro 4,Fuck yeah!
74,19,1,Janitor and Friend,"Well, looks like thangs are gettin' all PC again. [a shot of the house again]"
75,19,1,Janitor and Friend,Well how long d'you think this will last?
76,19,1,Janitor and Friend,Lasted about six years last time. We got at least [checks his watch] 5.9 years to go.
77,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Uhhh, hey Cartman. Uhwaht's goin' on? Aren't you going to ah, you know, go do something about this new principal?"
78,19,1,Eric Cartman,I've already got four days of detention. I don't want anymore. I'm gonna start following the rules.
79,19,1,Stan Marsh,"But, this isn't you, Cartman."
80,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules. And he gets away with it. Just like his hero! Come on, who's your hero, Cartman?!"
81,19,1,Eric Cartman,[sighs heavily] Tom Brady.
82,19,1,Stan Marsh,Right! And what does Tom Brady do after breaking the rules?
83,19,1,Eric Cartman,Deny and subvert.
84,19,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
85,19,1,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, what? Well what would Tom Brady say if he got caught shoplifting."
86,19,1,Eric Cartman,Everybody shoplifts. Why are you coming down on me?
87,19,1,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
88,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up to Cartman] You're Tom Brady, Cartman! And that new principal in there is the football commissioner trying to dictate his punishment to you. And what happens when an invulnerable cheater comes up against an elitist corporate dictator?"
89,19,1,Eric Cartman,A perfect storm of hypocrisy that everyone in the country has to deal with for months on end.
90,19,1,Eric Cartman,"[pacing back and forth] You're right, guys. I'm gonna Tom Brady this thing!"
91,19,1,Boys,Yeah!
92,19,1,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say ""You're not giving me four day of detention! You're only giving me one!"""
93,19,1,Boys,Yeah!
94,19,1,Eric Cartman,"NO! No, to hell with that! ""You're giving me NO days detention! And then I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife! Who's not even that hot, and kinda looks like a dude!"" [marches off]"
95,19,1,Boys,Yeah!
96,19,1,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] Thanks, guys. I almost forgot the lessons that football has taught us all. I can get around these pesky rules. Butters, I'm going to need your underwear. [walks off]"
97,19,1,Butters Stotch,Well ohhh-kay! [walks off after Cartman]
98,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Cool. I think we did it. [raises his left arm, and Stan high-fives it]"
99,19,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, PC Principal, how are you today?"
100,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,What are you doing in the faculty bathroom?
101,19,1,Eric Cartman,"You know, I think you and I got off on the wrong foot the other day. By all means, please, keep your dick out. You see, I'm not going to accept four days of detention and... you're going t'apologize publicly for being so strict to me and my friends at school."
102,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,What the fuck are you talking about?
103,19,1,Eric Cartman,"It's just a request, that's all. See you around. [stops and looks down] Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal. [picks it up] What's this? Why, this is a little boy's underwear. [sniffs at it] Why, this is Butters' underwear."
104,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,[zips up and looks at Cartman] What?
105,19,1,Eric Cartman,"PC Principal, you have Butters' underwear and now... [drops it into the urinal and soaks it in PC Principal's urine - the principal had not flushed the urinal - and pulls the briefs out.] Oh my gosh, it's got your DNA all over it. [through some windows above the urinal, Kyle, Butters, Craig, Stan, and Token watch the action unfold] This certainly doesn't look good for you. I don't need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding. Capiche?"
106,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,What did you just say?
107,19,1,Eric Cartman,You mean about keeping your dick out?
108,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"""Capiche""?! You're associating Italian-Americans to intimidation tactics?! [one by one, the boys' smiles disappear] You'd better watch your micro-aggression's, bro! [now the boys are afraid of the next move]"
109,19,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh-kay. Look, you don't want to end up like the spokesman for Subway, so you?"
110,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,Did you just use a term that excludes women from an occupation?! [picks Cartman up...]
111,19,1,Eric Cartman,"Okay, let's back up. [...and slams him against the stall] Aaah!"
112,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"[slams him several times into the wall next to the mirror] Did you just say ""spokesman"" instead of ""spokesperson""?! When women are just as capable at selling sandwiches as anyone?! [slams Cartman into the mirror, shattering it] Are you purposely trying to use words that assert your male privilege?! [slams Cartman into a sink, shattering it]"
113,19,1,Eric Cartman,"[quuickly] No, I'm sorry. I was just trying to frame you for raping Butters!"
114,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,[ignoring him] Do you think Italian-Americans and women are less important?! [pins Cartman to the floor and starts beating him up]
115,19,1,Eric Cartman,Oh God!
116,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,You dare to use words that alienate two communities of people who have to deal with verbal biases like yours on a daily basis?! [beats him up some more. The other boys leave the window and walk away.]
117,19,1,Randy Marsh,Can I speak with PC Principal please?
118,19,1,PC Bro 5,"Oh yeah. We got another one, guys!"
119,19,1,PC Bro 6,"All right. Bring him in, bro!"
120,19,1,PC Bro 7,[voice only] We're ready! Woo! [other PC bros haul him in and change his clothes]
121,19,1,Randy Marsh,"Hey what? [stands in line with a bunch of other guys] Hey no, I- No, I don't- [he is now wearing a PLEDGE shirt - he is now a pledge for this fraternity]"
122,19,1,PC Bro 8,"All the pledges take a shot! [the music is cut off, frat bros come in and offers the pledges swigs from various bottles of liquor]"
123,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"All right pledgies, we're excited. You wanna try and be PC. We hope you've got what it takes to join the most socially active group in America."
124,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,Weoooh!
125,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"You know, there's still some people out there that say ""What does being PC really mean?"" Well, I'll tell you what it means. It means you love nothin' more than beer, workin' out, and that feelin' you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression."
126,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Wooo! Yeah! Dude, let's go! Woowooo! Yeah!"
127,19,1,Randy Marsh,[takes a swig] Yeah!
128,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,Wooohooo!
129,19,1,Randy Marsh,[shakes his head vigorously] Wooo-ooo!
130,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,Wooohooo! let's go! Yeah!
131,19,1,Sharon Marsh,You got home pretty late last night. Six AM?
132,19,1,Randy Marsh,I've joined a social awareness group. It's a coalition that discourages the use of ... words that have negative or offensive connotations... to grant respect to people who are victims of unfair stereotypes.
133,19,1,Sharon Marsh,You got in at Six and now you're missing work.
134,19,1,Randy Marsh,"We've been getting away with horrible things, Sharon. Having- laughs at less privileged people and thinking it was harmless. Our group is... trying to be a civilizing influence... where we discuss and have meetings to better define and reinforce tolerance and acceptance [voice trails off] of all groups of people."
135,19,1,Sharon Marsh,Hm... And do they have booze at these meetings?
136,19,1,Randy Marsh,"Uhhhh... They serve refreshments, yes."
137,19,1,Stan Marsh,Cartman?
138,19,1,Eric Cartman,"[with raspy voice] We can't beat him, you guys. PC Principal is too strong."
139,19,1,Butters Stotch,What do we do now?
140,19,1,Eric Cartman,"There's nothing left to do. I'm going to admit I did something wrong, take my punishment, and move on. I'm not Tom Brady."
141,19,1,Butters Stotch,[earnestly] Oh no!
142,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, if we all tell the police what the principal did, he'll be fired!"
143,19,1,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
144,19,1,Eric Cartman,No way.
145,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,Why?
146,19,1,Eric Cartman,"Because PC Principal is right, Kyle. You and I are bigots, and it's time for us to grow up."
147,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No, you're a bigot."
148,19,1,Eric Cartman,"If I can face my prejudice, why can't you? We're two privileged, straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with."
149,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm not going to apologize for saying Caitlyn Jenner isn't a hero! In fact, personally, I think she's most likely not a very good person! [the boys gasp]"
150,19,1,Eric Cartman,"[In added pain] Aaahh, aahh! [looks left at Kyle] Kyle, believe me! I know the struggle with hatred. Let's make ourselves better people... together. [reaches out to Kyle]"
151,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, fat-ass."
152,19,1,Eric Cartman,"No more fat-shaming, Kyle. Let's start a new chapter."
153,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,So you're never gonna call me a dirty Jew again?
154,19,1,Eric Cartman,No. I'm going to call you... my friend.
155,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,Oh fuck you. [turns around and walks out]
156,19,1,Eric Cartman,I... guess we never realized how bad he really was.
157,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"All right, pledges, listen up. Congratulations on making it to the final cuts. [only three pledges are left - Randy and two other men.]"
158,19,1,Pledges,Wooohoo! Yeah!
159,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Now it's time for the final test. So what you're gonna have to do, to prove you belong with PC, is go out there, and check someone's privilege."
160,19,1,Pledge 1,Finally!
161,19,1,Pledge 2,Yes!
162,19,1,Randy Marsh,"I'm sorry, I don't know what that is."
163,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Topher, can you explain ""check your privilege"" please."
164,19,1,Topher,"[PC Bro 1] Uh, it's getting someone to acknowledge their own inherent privileges and reminding them to put them aside in order to better understand another human's plight."
165,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Yeah, see, there's some people out there like Brett fucking Favre who think that when we all stand up and applaud Caitlyn Jenner at the ESPY Awards, he can get away with one of these bullshit claps! [performs a limp clap] It's called ""clapping"" Favre! What the fuck are you doing?! Washing your hands?! You're either on board, or you're NOT, bro! Now, if he's gonna bring shame on someone, then he can have his privilege checked and have a little shame brought down on him!"
166,19,1,Randy Marsh,You want me to shame Brett Favre?
167,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,[stops to stare at Randy] No. 'Cause there's somebody even worse now.
168,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"AAAAHH! What the fuck, dude?! What the fuck?! [A few seconds later the men rush out of the room as he watches them leave. Then he looks down and sees pigs all over the floor. Each one has the word ""Biggit"" painted on.]"
169,19,1,Cartman Brady,"[turns around] I may be down, but I'm not out. Tom Brady's never out!"
170,19,1,Commissioner Cartman,You broke the rules!
171,19,1,Cartman Brady,"Fuck you, ""I broke the rules""! YOU're breaking the rules!"
172,19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"Fuck you, you broke the rules!"
173,19,1,Cartman Brady,"You broke the rules, how you found out I broke the rules!"
174,19,1,Coach Cartman,"Yeah, you broke the rules!"
175,19,1,Commissioner Cartman,I'm the commissioner! I can break the rules 'cause you guys broke the rules before! I didn't bust you enough!
176,19,1,Coach,"Just because you didn't bust us enough for breakin' the rules, that doesn't mean you can break the rules bustin' us now!"
177,19,1,Brady,"Just because you didn't bust us enough for breakin' the rules, that doesn't mean you can break the rules bustin' us now!"
178,19,1,Commissioner Cartman,Fuck both you guys! I can do whatever I want! I'm breakin' the rules!
179,19,1,Cartman Brady,"Fuck you, I'm Tom Brady!"
180,19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"Fuck you, I'm the commissioner! I'll make up new rules!"
181,19,1,Coach,Fuck your rules!
182,19,1,Brady,Fuck your rules!
183,19,1,Commissioner Cartman,"Fuck you guys, always fucking rules!"
184,19,1,Cartman Brady,Fuck all the rules! [all this wakes Cartman up]
185,19,1,Eric Cartman,Ack! Butters!
186,19,1,Butters Stotch,"I'm here, Eric."
187,19,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh Butters, I've lived such a horrible life! Always doing whatever I want and claiming it to be for integrity. BUTTERS?"
188,19,1,Butters Stotch,Yes Eric.
189,19,1,Eric Cartman,I'm never going back to the person I was. I swear to God. From now on the world is going to know a new and better Eric Cartman.
190,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,Will you please tell your dad to leave me alone?
191,19,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what happened?"
192,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps inside, tree and all] Your dad was on my lawn yelling at me all night, and after I finally fell asleep I woke up Saran-wrapped to a tree with penises on my face. And this. [removes his hat to reveal his hair gathered into four crude ponytails, one of them covered in a condom. Stan is stunned, but takes it in]"
193,19,1,Stan Marsh,"Hang on. [walks to the kitchen] Dad, did you draw dicks on my friend's face?"
194,19,1,Randy Marsh,"[back at the kitchen table, with a hangover, like last time] Did I check his privilege? Yes. I had some refreshments and I checked your friend's privilege."
195,19,1,Stan Marsh,"That's my best friend, Dad! Stop shaming him because you want to fit in!"
196,19,1,Randy Marsh,"Stan, straight white males in a capitalistic society have little- understanding of victimization compared to injustices against the underprivileged. Dicks on your face is a very first-world problem. [the liquor comes back into his mouth] Oh shit! [vomits as he heads toward the sink]"
197,19,1,Stan Marsh,"[returns] Look, Kyle, maybe you should just say Caitlyn Jenner is a hero."
198,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't even say she wasn't a hero! I just said she isn't a hero to me! I didn't like Bruce Jenner as a person when he was on the Kardashians, and I don't suddenly like him now!"
199,19,1,A passing bro,Weoo-weoo-weoo-weooh!
200,19,1,Stan Marsh,Her.
201,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"HER, yes!"
202,19,1,Eric Cartman,"OH. Eh, oh it's no use, Butters. I want to get out there and start making positive changes, but I... can barely even walk. [thinks a moment] How is everybody doing?"
203,19,1,Butters Stotch,"Well they're fine. Everyone's just kind of keepin' their mouths shut. It's kinda nice. [smiles] So the PC guys are leavin' people alone. Well, except for..."
204,19,1,Eric Cartman,Who?
205,19,1,Butters Stotch,"Well, well now they've made Kyle their main target."
206,19,1,Eric Cartman,[soft music plays] ...Kyle? ...My friend Kyle? [begins removing his hospital clothes slowly and replacing them with his own clothes]
207,19,1,Butters Stotch,"Eric, what are you doing?"
208,19,1,Eric Cartman,I don't have a choice. I have to take these PC people out.
209,19,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh, but I thought you agreed with them."
210,19,1,Eric Cartman,"I do, but I have to help Kyle, even if I don't agree with his hateful, bigoted thoughts. Kyle's view may be warped. I personally think Caitlyn Jenner's a stunning hero, [clears his throat] but that doesn't mean I'll stand by while Kyle's intolerance is dealt with violently. We're going to war with these PC people once and for all! Butters, I'm going to need 200 pregnant Mexican women and some taco launchers."
211,19,1,Butters Stotch,Well ohhh-kay!
212,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"Social Justice 1 2 3 Woowoo!
I wanna be PC Woowoo!
It's just the way to be for me!
And you!
Woowoo!
Your hateful slurs are through! Woowoo!"
213,19,1,PC Bro 9,I call woowoo on you!
214,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,Woowoo! We'll fight until you're PC black and blue!
215,19,1,Randy Marsh,Woowoo!
216,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"We are language police fighting bigotry!
Hurtful words can suck our turds, 'cause it's PC for me!"
217,19,1,PC Bro 5,And you!
218,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,Woowoo! Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah!
219,19,1,PC Bro 5,"Fuck yeah, bro! PC bro! [Cartman is now on the scene, walking with a crutch and a walkie-talkie.]"
220,19,1,Eric Cartman,"All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! [Butters, with a semaphore flag in each hand, gives the signal for the women to rush the house]
Pregnant Mexican Women:	Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!"
221,19,1,PC Bro 5,"Fuck, bro?! [Cartman stops by the taco launchers, which are manned by Clyde, Craig, and Tweek]"
222,19,1,Eric Cartman,"Fire the taco launchers! [the boys load the launchers and let fly. Tacos rain down upon the frat house. The women arrive and run into the house, picking up tacos on the way] Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! [a truck load of Syrian refugee children is waiting for the truck bed to empty out. Butters releases the cargo door and the kids flood out towards the house]"
223,19,1,PC Bro 2,"Dude, what is this, bro?!"
224,19,1,PC Bro 6,"I don't know, bro!"
225,19,1,Eric Cartman,"[looking through some binoculars] The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! [Jared appears with his arms stretched out, ready to grab anything. He follows the women and the kids into the frat house, but doesn't grab anyone. The rest of the neighborhood gathers and marches towards the house]"
226,19,1,Stephen Stotch,What in the world is going on??
227,19,1,Eric Cartman,"All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos. [sees Jared on the balcony trying to grab some kids, and some bros stop Jared] Jared needs backup, send in the Chinese drivers. [a split second later two cars crash into each other in front of the house.]"
228,19,1,A PC Bro,[falls from the balcony to his death] Ohhh! [lands on his head]
229,19,1,Eric Cartman,"All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! Gimme a- Oh fuck, there's Kyle. [lowers his binoculars] What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?"
230,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Enough! Stop! Everyone STOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHP! [The camera shows his head bigger than usual and the air brighter then usual. His voice echoes across town and everyone stops in their tracks. A pregnant woman picks up a taco and runs off with it.] This is so wrong! I can't let it continue! This is not ever what I intended! I just want to say... Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. There's no other way to say it. What she did took bravery, and she is absolutely stunning. [Moments later, PC Principal steps forward and begins clapping. Once the clapping reaches normal speed, others begin to join in. A live-action shot of Brett Farve at the ESPYs ""limp-clapping"" is even thrown in]"
231,19,1,Townsman,Wooo.
232,19,1,Randy Marsh,"Ow, hot. Hot hot, hothohhht. [PC Bro 4 takes the branding iron off, and Randy is officially a PC Bro. He stands up and gets dressed.] Ahhh."
233,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"I gotta hand it to you, Marsh. You really checked that little boy's privilege. Using those Syrian refugees was genius, bro."
234,19,1,PC Bro 4,Yeah. I would have never thought to use offensive imagery and outrageous stereotypes to provoke someone to open their eyes.
235,19,1,Randy Marsh,So I'm PC now?
236,19,1,PC Principal and PC Bros,"You're not only PC, you've actually changed my PC. [whips out some sunglasses] Congrats. Here's your Oakleys."
237,19,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh wow. Oakleys! [puts them on and his voice changes] Oh yeah bro, these are sweet.
[The big five stand nearby observing the small ceremony]"
238,19,1,Stan Marsh,"So I guess PC Principal is here to stay, huh?"
239,19,1,Eric Cartman,"Yes. But at least we showed him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue. [Kyle lowers his eyelids and the others back away] What's wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too."
240,19,1,Kyle Broflovski,"It just seems to me like we all lost in this, and that the only person who won was you."
241,19,1,Eric Cartman,"Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude."
242,19,2,President Barack Obama,"Now, last week we were all reminded that intolerance still exists in our country. It took a very special young student to light up social media, and we've invited him to the White House today to show our appreciation. Because never have there been more tolerant, more moving words than Kyle Broflovski's speech about his hero Caitlyn Jenner. [applause. Kyle is shown with his eyes half-closed - an indication that he doesn't want to be there.] Come on up here, Kyle."
243,19,2,Mr Garrison,"You see?? There! This is why it's happening! Everyone's preachin' openness and acceptance, and so now millions of goddamned immigrants are comin' over the border and nobody seems to care!"
244,19,2,Mr Adler,Well what are you gonna do? In today's world it's like you can't even say anything negative about illegal immigrants.
245,19,2,Randy Marsh,"[Approaching and gesturing like a siren] Weoo weoo weoo weoo weoo! Did somebody over here say ""illegal immigrants""? Because the correct term is ""undocumented immigrants,"" alright bro? [leaves]"
246,19,2,Mr Garrison,"[hushed] It's like nobody cares! And they just keep comin'. Crossin' the border with their dirty families, playin' their stupid music! [looks to his left] I mean, look at 'em! I'll bet not ONE of them is here legally! [a group of Canadians is playing pool.]"
247,19,2,Canadian 1,Alright guy!
248,19,2,Canadian 2,Hey buddih!
249,19,2,Canadian 3,Hey buddih!
250,19,2,Canadian 4,"[the shooter] Hey, what's going on fwiend!"
251,19,2,Canadian 5,"[Wearing a Canada sweater] Hey, buddih! Another Moosehead, eh?"
252,19,2,Mr Garrison,We should have put up a goddamned wall. [Jimbo and Richard now look at the Canadians as well]
253,19,2,President Barack Obama,"But wait, there's still more, [the three man now look at the TV] because this country was built on dreamers, and Kyle, we want to make your dreams come true. And so here is your hero, Caitlyn Jenner. [applause as Caitlyn joins Barack and Kyle at the podium. Kyle is taken aback]"
254,19,2,Caitlyn Jenner,[with a lisp] I just wanna say thank you Kyle for your beautiful words of support.
255,19,2,President Barack Obama,"Now Kyle, we've got another little surprise for you. We told you we were flying you back home, but the truth is, you're getting a ride back all the way with your hero! How do you like that?! [Ooohs and applause follow.]"
256,19,2,Caitlyn Jenner,"Buckle up, buckaroo! [Revs up and speeds away. Almost immediately an elderly person crosses her path and she runs her over, thoroughly killing her under her wheels. The press applauds.]"
257,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Okay children, let's take our seats. As you've probably noticed, our government has decided to let anyone who wants to, cross the border and screw up our country! [before him is a crowded room, with more desks and lots of new Canadian students.] I know you're all as pissed off as I am, so why don't we begin today's lesson on why the once-great empire of Rome, fell to shit! Huh?! Who can tell my why Rome fell to shit?! [all the Canadian kids raise their hands] No, somebody who matters! [the Canadian students begin to clamor. Garrison puts his left hand over his nose and closes his eyes] Alright, fine, in the orange shirt."
258,19,2,Canadian Kid 1,"[orange shirt] The Roman Empire, buddy, was facing ehh several issues, guy, as they reached the new millennium, friend, and rather-"
259,19,2,Mr Garrison,"[irritated] Oh, speak in English! You see, [turns around and begins writing on the board] what happened is that these immigrants called Goths [writes the word and circles and underlines it] were welcomed into Roman territories [writes the word Roman on the board] because some people felt bad for them. [another Canadian boy checks his watch and hops off his seat, opens a small case and pulls out a trumpet] And then the Goths suddenly decided they were being oppressed, you see, and so then- [the boy begins to play a familiar tune, and Mr. Garrison turns around] What the hell are you doing?! [the other Canadian kids get out of their seats and whip out their trumpets to play the song]"
260,19,2,Canadian Kid 2,"[in a suit] It's 8am, guy."
261,19,2,Mr Garrison,"[loses his temper,throws his notes and chalk] Well that's it! Why don't you Canucks go back where you came from?! [they stop and look aghast at him]"
262,19,2,PC Principal,"You really think you can refer to an undocumented immigrant as a ""Canuck""?!"
263,19,2,Mr Garrsion,"PC Principal, they got up in the middle of my lecture and started playing music!"
264,19,2,PC Principal,So did you forget that at eight and eleven all Canadians face east and play Chuck Mangione? [stands up and puts his hands on the desk] Or did you not care to find out about their religious customs?
265,19,2,Mr Garrsion,"Thuh, they don't even speak English!"
266,19,2,PC Principal,"Then you need to be teaching in both languages from now on! Mackey, sign the faculty up for Canadian-language night classes!"
267,19,2,Mr Garrsion,What?!
268,19,2,Mr Mackey,"[bowing profusely] Yes, PC Principal! R-right away! M'kay?"
269,19,2,PC Principal,"You're on thin ice, Garrison! Get in line or you'll be out of a job, bro!"
270,19,2,Stan Marsh,What are they doing now? [several tables have Canadian kids seated and eating. Butters stands up for a better look]
271,19,2,Butters,Well they're all eatin' together and praying. A-and they're puttin' syrup on their Mac & Cheese! [sits back down]
272,19,2,Clyde Donovan,"Ugh, so weird!"
273,19,2,Token Black,There's just so many of them.
274,19,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I think this whole thing is a conspiracy."
275,19,2,Token Black,Whattaya mean?
276,19,2,Eric Cartman,Think about what happened: American has pretty secure border for years. Kyle gives a big speech about tolerance and acceptance that goes viral. A bunch of Canadians cross the border illegally. Kyle's brother is Canadian. What if Kyle knowingly gave that speech to get all the illegals in?
277,19,2,Kyle Broflovski,[annoyed] I'm sitting right here.
278,19,2,Eric Cartman,And he's sitting right here.
279,19,2,Kyle Broflovski,You really think just my speech brought on a wave of illegal immigration?!
280,19,2,Stan Marsh,"You did kind of go overboard, dude."
281,19,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Stan, betrayed] What?!"
282,19,2,Stan Marsh,"It's just... I know you like giving speeches and stuff, but not everything is black and white."
283,19,2,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah, I mean, it's fine you wanna go preach about Caitlyn Jenner, but you can't just make blanket statements about letting anyone do whatever they want."
284,19,2,Kyle Broflovski,I didn't even want to give that speech!
285,19,2,Eric Cartman,"[interrupting] Yeah, yeah, this is interesting. Have you guys read Genesis Thirty-four?"
286,19,2,Butters,Uhn-un.
287,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, it's intriguing, because in Genesis Thirty-four, the Jews actually did something similar to what Kyle is doing now."
288,19,2,Kyle Broflovski,Uh I'm not responsible for this! Illegal immigration has been happening forever.
289,19,2,Eric Cartman,But it's happening a lot more now. After you decide to give a big speech about Caitlyn Jenner. Because you want to bring down the cultural fabric of America. 'Cause you're a Jew.
290,19,2,Kyle Broflovski,"You guys, immigrants, either legal or illegal, are always gonna find ways to cross into richer countries if they're not living-"
291,19,2,Stan Marsh,"[briefly puts his left hand over his nose] Oh boy, here we go again. [the other boys leave as well]"
292,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm out."
293,19,2,Butters,"Yeah, sorry. I can't listen to another one either. [Kyle is left alone, bewildered]"
294,19,2,Mr Stkrdknmibalz,"Happy evening, friends. My name is Mr. Stkrdknmibalz ,(stick-yer-dick-in-my-balls) and we are going to learn Canadian. [Garrison shifts in his seat] With a lot of practice, you're going to find that speaking Canadian isn't so difficult. And in fact, our alphabet and yours are fairly similar. So why don't we begin singing it together? [Clears his throat]
A B C D E F Guy
H I J K L M N O Buddih
Q R S T U Fwiend
W X Eh! And [farts]
These are Canadian ABCs
Susie likes hairy balls. Whattaya think of these?
Alright, now everyone!"
295,19,2,Class,"[begins singing]
A B C D E F Guy
H I J K L M N O Buddih
Q R S T U Fwiend
W X Eh And [Mr. Garrison begins to daydream]"
296,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Where has my country gone?
Where has my country gone?
It was a land of opportunity that we held dear
But now all these other assholes are comin' here.
And where's my country gone?
It was just here like, two seconds ago.
'Cause when they said that this was the land of the free
I'm pretty sure that they were referring to me
And my country's gone!
It got upset and now it's wandered away
It took 43 Presidents to make us stand tall
And just one black guy to unravel it all
Country gone!
Please tell it that we need her back home.
There's a great big hole in the liberty bucket
'Cause someone forgot to tell the foreigners to suck it!
And now they're all hanging out on my lawn... [trumpets come up and play ""Feels So Good""]
And now they're ruining my song
Makin' it sound like Chuck Mangione [trumpets fade out]
Where has my country gone?"
297,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Seems like everyone's afraid to speak the truth around here! Well I'm throwin' my hat in and sayin' I'll figure this thing out! Now I might not understand politics, or immigration policies, or... the law. Or basic... ideological... concepts. But dammit I understand there there's a bunch of Canadians here and I'm gonna do somethin' about it! [applause and cheers]"
298,19,2,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. In order for better understanding we've asked students of Canadian origin to introduce you to their culture and [spots a disturbance in the stands] HEY LESLIE! SHUT YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! [Leslie stops whispering into her friend's ear and looks at PC Principal] - to introduce you to their culture and customs. So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history."
299,19,2,Three students dressed in Native American garb,"We are the Hopewell and Abenaki, first settlers of Canadian soil--"
300,19,2,Kindergartner,Guy.
301,19,2,Five students dressed in European clothing,"We are French and British explorers, seeking furs and goods. [Mr. Garrison walks up and takes the mic]"
302,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Yeah, and I'm Dan Rather, and I got news for you! Nobody wants you here! [the gym is silent] Sorry not sorry! It's time for someone to say it like it is, and make our country great again!"
303,19,2,PC Principal,"Garrison, what do you think you're-?"
304,19,2,Mr Garrison,"And I'm also not afraid to stand up to PC Principal! You, sir, have a pizza face and you suck your mom's dick!"
305,19,2,PC Principal,That's it Garrison! You are fired from South Park Elementary!
306,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh, see? And now I'm fired! That's the cold, hard truth of immigration! Well there's only one immigration policy that I believe in, and that's fuck 'em all to death! [the students gasp] I'm just sayin' what everyone's thinkin' here kids!, Sorry not sorry!
[The school hallway, moments later. The Canadian kids walk out of school in anger]"
307,19,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, the Canadians are pissed off."
308,19,2,Token Black,Can you really blame them?
309,19,2,Butters,What made Mr. Garrison do that?
310,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Guys, what if this was all exactly what Kyle planned? Get the Canadians here, make them feel persecuted, and then what? Uprisings? Rebellion? Next thing you know, they're sending us to camps and using us as livestock!"
311,19,2,Butters,You really think Kyle would do that?
312,19,2,Stan Marsh,"That doesn't matter. We have to think of a way to smooth this over, fast."
313,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we're gonna need a symbolic union."
314,19,2,Token Black,A what?
315,19,2,Eric Cartman,"You know, what's that story about the two sides that were fighting and, then a guy from one side got with a girl from the other side and their love sort of brought the groups together?"
316,19,2,Butters,Lion King II?
317,19,2,Eric Cartman,"[snaps his fingers and points to Butters] Yes, Lion King II. I mean, if we can get one of us to go out with one of them - probably, have sex - then it could be a symbol of us all getting along."
318,19,2,Craig Tucker,"Yeah, it's kind of like when the princess of one country marries the prince of another."
319,19,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, come on, this is stupid. You guys, when two groups of people don't understand each other you can't just try and diffuse the tension with a little-"
320,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Is he seriously? Is he seriously giving a speech right now? [all quiet] Is he SERIOUSLY giving a speech right now?! [the other boys look back at Kyle angrily, and Kyle is left speechless] This is gonna have to happen pretty fast, so whoever's gonna do it needs to ask a Canadian girl out soon. 1 2 3 Not it."
321,19,2,Stan Marsh,[one after the other] Not it!
322,19,2,Craig Tucker,[one after the other] Not it!
323,19,2,Kenny McCormick,[one after the other] Not it!
324,19,2,Clyde Donovan,[one after the other] Not it!
325,19,2,Token Black,[one after the other] Not it!
326,19,2,Butters,"No, no. Not it! Oh. OH SHIT!"
327,19,2,Anchor Tom,Support is growing for a Colorado man who claims the way to deal with illegal immigrants is to fuck them all to death. We go live to Minnesota.
328,19,2,Field Reporter Dan,"Tom, the political activist is going around the country to get support for his agenda, and- Uh Mr. Garrison, you believe the immigration problem is easy to solve?"
329,19,2,Mr Garrison,Yes. Fuck them all to death. Let'a make this country great again. [cheers swell from his supporters]
330,19,2,Field Reporter Dan,"And when you say ""Fuck them all to death,"" what are you actually suggesting be done?"
331,19,2,Mr Garrison,"I'm suggesting we round them all up, pull down their pants, and fuck them until their spirits leave their bodies!"
332,19,2,Supporter 1,[wearing a Snap Right Tools cap] USA!
333,19,2,Mr Garrison,"And then, after we've fucked every last one of 'em to death, we build a big wall! And if anyone comes over the wall, we fuck them to death too! And then we fuck to death all the-"
334,19,2,Anchor Tom,Uh Dan? Dan? We're getting word that a wall has already been built. [to the control booth] Is that right? Yes? Yeah- CNN is confirming that Canada has built a wall to keep us out.
335,19,2,Mr Garrison,"What do you mean they built a wall?! They can't build a fucking wall! Oh, fuck them to death!"
336,19,2,Guard,"Hey there! Beautiful day, isn't it?"
337,19,2,Mr Garrison,What the hell is this?!
338,19,2,Guard,"Oh this? This is a wall. Sorry buddih, nobody allowed in."
339,19,2,Jimbo Kern,Can they do that?
340,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Look, we came to speak with your government about that"
341,19,2,Guard,"Yeah, no, sorry! Everything past here is ours. You can't, you can't go past, past here."
342,19,2,Mr Garrison,We're Americans! We don't even want to be over there! What do you think we're gonna do?
343,19,2,Guard,"Well, you know, we just don't want you ... raping our women and stuff."
344,19,2,Supporter 2,That is ridiculous! [crosses his arms]
345,19,2,Mr Garrison,"All right, smartass! That's just about enough-"
346,19,2,Guard,"Look, there's just some really cool shit back here and we don't feel like sharing it."
347,19,2,Mr Garrison,[suddenly curious] Cool shit like what?
348,19,2,Guard,Don't worry aboot it.
349,19,2,Mr Garrison,No! What's back there? Let me see!
350,19,2,Jimbo Kern,"[pulling him back] It's all right, Garrison."
351,19,2,Mr Garrison,"No! Goddammit, let me see!"
352,19,2,Eric Cartman,What about that one? In the glasses? She's kinda hot.
353,19,2,Butters,She's not hot! She looks like a messed-up cucumber with wieners on it!
354,19,2,Eric Cartman,"All right, how about the lanky one, there? Ooo, ooo, What about the one in the hat? She kind of looks like Alanis Morissette, huh?"
355,19,2,Butters,Alanis Morissette is like 80 years old or something! [stomps his right foot down on the snow] Jeez!
356,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Bu-Butters, relax."
357,19,2,Butters,"Well I don't want a Canadian girlfriend, Eric!"
358,19,2,Eric Cartman,Okay. Do you just want a race war?
359,19,2,Butters,No! The one in the white shoes isn't that ugly.
360,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, go fuck the one in the white shoes."
361,19,2,Butters,"Okay! [walks over to the bench with the girl in white shoes next to it] Hi, my name's Butters, what's yours."
362,19,2,Charlotte,I'm Charlotte. [her friends giggle]
363,19,2,Butters,"Oh Charlotte, I've never done this before. You think Scar's up there? He wasn't my father, but he's still part of me. Oh no, Simba, we have barely begun. We'll run away together and ... and...?"
364,19,2,Eric Cartman,[satisfied with the way Butters interaction is playing out. To himself] And start a pride all of our own.
365,19,2,Field Reporter Dan,"Tom, the scene at the Canadian border is electric as several political leaders try and strategize how to deal with being shut out of Canada. [in the background three podiums appear on the road right in front of the wall. Garrison and two other leaders step up to the mics.]"
366,19,2,Male politician,"If the Canadian government wants to put up a wall, they have every right."
367,19,2,Female politician,"And yet, we must ask why they thought this to be necessary."
368,19,2,Mr Garrison,"No, fuck them and fuck you! [points at the female politician] I wanna see if they have really cool shit back there!"
369,19,2,Female politician,What we need is a-
370,19,2,Mr Garrison,No! [points at the female politician] You've got a gaping gash [points at the male politician] and you've got vinegary balls! The Canadians can't do this! Don't they realize that hundreds of thousands of their people are over here illegally?
371,19,2,Guard,"Oh, you guys didn't put up a wall?"
372,19,2,Mr Garrison,"And you keep your goddamned mouth shut, smart-ass! I'll deal with you! [cheers and applause from his supporters. He turns to face them.] I get things done, and I'm gettin' back there! [more cheers and applause]"
373,19,2,Butters,Here you go.
374,19,2,Charlotte,"Thanks, Butters. I'm sore-y I didn't know what ice cream was."
375,19,2,Butters,"What's ""sore-y""?"
376,19,2,Charlotte,Well that's what Canadians say to express remorse.
377,19,2,Butters,"Oh. Heh, he-hey, heh that's neato. [his cell phone rings] Oh. Eh, hang on Charlotte, one sec. [walks off a bit and picks up] What do you want?!"
378,19,2,Eric Cartman,Have you given her the old Hot Cosby yet?
379,19,2,Butters,"No, we saw a movie and now we're goin' to the park."
380,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, we don't have time for that! I told you you have to cut to the chase with a Hot Cosby!"
381,19,2,Butters,"If I'm gonna be with this girl, I don't want her someday thinking it was all super-rushed!"
382,19,2,Eric Cartman,"Nobody cares about forty years from now when she suddenly changes her mind, Butters! Time is of the essence! We're all gonna die! [hangs up. Butters returns to Charlotte]"
383,19,2,Charlotte,Everything all right?
384,19,2,Butters,"Yeah, just some work-related stuff."
385,19,2,Charlotte,"So hey, I wanted to see if you wanted to come over to my house for dinner tomorrow."
386,19,2,Butters,"[getting nervous] Oh boy, yes I'd love to, here we go, oh God."
387,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Okay that's, that's good. Watch the balls. Okay, all right, give me the helmet. [Jimbo reaches down and hands the helmet to Mr. Garrison] We'll see what they've got behind that goddamned wall! [turns around to face his supporters] You know what I am, friends? I'm a doer."
388,19,2,Garrison Supporters,"Yeah. Yeah, that's right."
389,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Canada says we can't go into their country, I'm going into their country! And when I do, I am fucking every last Canadian... so hard! [cheers and applause] All right, let's do this! [drops down into the barrel. Jimbo and Ned seal it up. Several supporters lift the barrel up over their shoulders and carry it to the railing]"
390,19,2,Garrison Supporters,USA USA USA USA USA! [they throw it into the river and watch it approach the falls] USA USA USA! [the barrel goes over the falls and breaks up a few seconds later. Jimbo screams] USA US-!
391,19,2,Jimbo Kern,"Aww, he's dead."
392,19,2,Dad,"So young man, I understand that you and my daughter have started a romance."
393,19,2,Butters,"Well uh, well yes, sir."
394,19,2,Dad,"And I suppose you have a thing for Canadian girls, huh? Is that it? You've got maple fever?"
395,19,2,Charlotte,"Ey, daddy!"
396,19,2,Dad,"I'm sore-y, Charlotte, but I get suspicious. It's bad enough we have to live in America, now all the boys with maple fever are gonna wanna have at our daughter."
397,19,2,Mom,"That's enough, Thomas!"
398,19,2,Butters,"W-wait, you don't wanna be here?"
399,19,2,Charlotte,Why would we want to be here?
400,19,2,Butters,"Wuh well, you know, 'cause everything is great here, and we have cool stuff."
401,19,2,"Charlotte, her dad Thomas and her mom",Canada has everything. It's the greatest country on Earth.
402,19,2,Butters,"But- so- then, why did you leave?"
403,19,2,"Charlotte, her dad Thomas and her mom","[sighs and gets up from the his chair, and walks over to a window] There were several candidates during the Canadian elections. One of them was this brash asshole who just spoke his mind. He didn't really offer any solutions, he just said outrageous things. we... thought it was funny. [the mom begins to cry quietly, and her son comforts her] Nobody really thought he'd ever be President. It was a joke! But we just let the joke go on for too long. He kept gaining momentum, and by the time we were all ready to say ""Okay, let's get serious now. Who should really be President?"" he was already being sworn into office. [turns around] We weren't paying attention. [collapses and begins to cry, bumping into the table against the window] We weren't paying attention! [lets out all his tears and the family gathers around him to comfort him.]"
404,19,2,Butters,"Jeez, how bad can a president be?"
405,19,2,Mr President,"If certain people want to leave this country, then let them! You tell those pussy homos they can suck my balls!"
406,19,2,Johnson,But Mr. President-
407,19,2,Mr President,"And tell the Prime Minister of China that HE can suck my balls! Oh, and Johnson?"
408,19,2,Johnson,Mr. President?
409,19,2,Mr President,Suck my balls.
410,19,2,Charlotte,I'm sore-y about my papa. He can be really emotional sometimes.
411,19,2,Butters,"You don't got to be sore-y. It's me who should be sore-y. I think everyone has the wrong idea about your people, Charlotte."
412,19,2,Charlotte,It's okay. We just have to give them time.
413,19,2,Butters,"I wasn't supposed to have time. I was supposed to give you a Hot Cosby, so our species could coexist. But now I realize you guys don't even wanna be here."
414,19,2,Charlotte,Oh.. so do you want to be here? Now?
415,19,2,Butters,"There's really nowhere I'd rather be. [smiles] If it's okay with you, well I'd like to try a nice Slow Cosby instead."
416,19,2,Charlotte,"In Canada, we call a Slow Cosby ... love. [kisses Butters on the cheek. Butters strokes it and smiles again] Oh look! [a meteorite zooms across the sky] A shooting star! In Canada, we say that's... good luck."
417,19,2,Butters,So do we.
418,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Hello? [his voice echoes through the canyon of high-rises in the city. He walks by an empty coffee shop with a loose door banging in the wind. He hears a man sobbing, but sees abandoned cars, paper strewn everywhere, trash... he finds the man sitting on the roof of a 13-story law office building]"
419,19,2,Man,Oh God! Oh God!
420,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Hey! Where is everyone, guy? [the man sobs some more and then stands and jumps to his death.] Jeez."
421,19,2,Mr President,What?! Hey! How did a US citizen get past my wall?!
422,19,2,Mr Garrison,I came here to find out where my country gone!
423,19,2,Mr President,Where your country gone? Where my country gone?!
424,19,2,Mr Garrison,"No, where my country gone, bitch?!"
425,19,2,Mr President,"Nobody talks to me like that, buddih! [goes around his desk]"
426,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Nobody talks to me like that, fwiend! [they begin to fight on the carpet. Mr. Garrison takes the President down and wrestles with him until the President is face down] Eurgh! Yeah?"
427,19,2,Mr President,Stupid-! Unh!
428,19,2,Mr Garrison,Little asshole!
429,19,2,Mr President,This is why I built that wall!
430,19,2,Mr Garrison,"You think you can-? [grabs the back of the President's head and slams it down] Hey! Here you go! Here you go! [keeps beating the President down] Look, guy, I came here to do one thing! [takes off his own swim suit and begins raping the President]"
431,19,2,Mr President,"Hey, what the-? Aah! Hey, that pokes, buddih! Aah!"
432,19,2,Aide,"Oh my God, guy."
433,19,2,Mr President,"Please! Please, I can't- Oh. NO! No please, NO! NO! [Garrison inhales some poppers, then resumes the raping with increased vigor] Ohhh! Ohhh! Nooo!"
434,19,2,Mom,"Oh look at them, Thomas. I think they really like each other."
435,19,2,"Charlotte, her dad Thomas and her mom","Yes, I have to admit. It seems they're falling in Slow Cosby. [someone knocks on the front door] I'll get it. [goes to the front door and opens it]"
436,19,2,Canadian 6,"Hey, did you hear the news, buddih? The Canadian Presidents been fucked to death!"
437,19,2,Canadian 7,[across the street] Yes! Yes!
438,19,2,"Charlotte, her dad Thomas and her mom",What? Are you sure?
439,19,2,Mom,"What is it, Thomas?"
440,19,2,"Charlotte, her dad Thomas and her mom","The Canadian President got fucked to death, darling."
441,19,2,Mom,Oh my goodness! Should we go back to Canada then?
442,19,2,"Charlotte, her dad Thomas and her mom","Yes, I guess let's go back! [and so the Canadians start packing up and moving out. The Marshes stand outside their house looking at the exodus]"
443,19,2,Canadians,"See ya! Bye! It's been real, guy! See ya, guy! [once they're all gone, Butters appears on the road chasing after Charlotte]"
444,19,2,Butters,Charlotte!
445,19,2,Charlotte,"I'll Skype you when I'm home, my love! [soon she's too far away]"
446,19,2,Butters,"Ah, I should have done the Hot Cosby."
447,19,2,Supporter 3,"[voice only] You did it, Garrison!"
448,19,2,Supporter 4,"[voice only] Thank you, Garrison!"
449,19,2,Mr Garrison,"Friends. I think I've proven that my policies work to get things done. I know what my true calling is, and I'm gonna keep this goin' all the way to Washington."
450,19,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[gets up on stage to clear his name] Hold on, wait! It wasn't me! I wasn't the one who brought the Canadians here! It was something just like this. Don't you see? If there's anything we've learned, it's that we have to stop this kind of sensationalist politics before the same thing happens to us, because if we let this kind of... [stops himself] this... kind of... [the crowd looks at him, annoyed]"
451,19,2,Eric Cartman,Dude!
452,19,2,Stan Marsh,Unbelievable! [Kyle turns left and walks off stage]
453,19,2,Mr Garrison,"All right, my friends. I have to say goodbye now, because I'm off to Washington with my running mate! [the camera shows whom the running mate is as Garrison gets into the passenger seat]"
454,19,2,Caitlyn Jenner,"Buckle up, buckaroo! [Revs up and speeds away. Almost immediately a young woman crosses her path and she runs her over, thoroughly killing her under her wheels. The crowd cheers and applauds.]"

458,19,3,Jimmy Fallon,"Okay okay okay. So this guy is running for President and he hates immigrants, and he's basically an idiot. [the audience laughs throughout] Not surprisingly, this guy is from a predominantly white town called South Park, Colorado. Or Shit-heads of America, Incorporated, I'm not sure. Yeah, if this guy is the best their town has to offer, can you imagine who he left behind? [affecting a hick accent] ""Oh hey, I'm from South Park! We don't take kindly to respecting human beings!"" [a shot of Randy and Sharon watching from the sofa with their jaws dropped] You, you think South Park has a university? ""Welcome to South Park University."" [a shot of Gerald and Sheila in bed, watching with jaws dropped] ""Please open your shotguns and slap your wives!"" [a shot of Butters watching the show on the phone, in bed. He's crying quietly] ""I live in South Park and my IQ's so low I've got's ta dig for it. Hey, did someone say 'rape?' That's the word for 'clever' here in South Park"" [the camera is back on Randy and Sharon]"
459,19,3,Randy Marsh,[turns off the TV] That's not funny. [gets up and walks away.]
460,19,3,Stan Marsh,So not cool. How does someone just rip on us like that?
461,19,3,Kyle Broflovski,I can't believe Jimmy Fallon hates us. Jimmy Fallon loves everything. Why would he slam our whole town?
462,19,3,Eric Cartman,Because apparently he doesn't care that his jokes are at the expense of actual people.
463,19,3,Butters Stotch,Wull do you think it's true? Do you think we're really bigoted country bumpkins?
464,19,3,Eric Cartman,"No. [steps forward] Hey, we are not bumpkins! Okay?! Kenny's a bumpkin!"
465,19,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Well fuck you, dude!)"
466,19,3,Eric Cartman,"We don't have junk cars in our yards, that's just your family, Kenny! [Kyle is about to defend Kenny, but Stan speaks up]"
467,19,3,Stan Marsh,I just hope somebody finds a way to fix this.
468,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,I've called you all here because South Park has an image problem. Thanks to Mr. Garrison we are now being referred to as the shit-heads of America. One of our more politically sensitive citizens has proposed an idea for this crisis and I'd like you to hear him out.
469,19,3,Randy Marsh,"[takes the dais as the Mayor steps aside] Hello everyone, I'm Randy Marsh, and I've been PC for almost two weeks now. You know, we've all been making changes to be more socially conscious, but have we really done enough? The truth is, there's something we're lacking as a community, and it's time we all faced it. What this town needs... is a Whole Foods. [a lot of chatter springs up in the audience.] It would instantly validate us as a town that cares about stuff."
470,19,3,Stephen Stotch,We couldn't get a Whole Foods to open here.
471,19,3,Randy Marsh,And why not?! Huh?! We all just don't believe we could get a Whole Foods! Because we don't believe in ourselves!
472,19,3,Fr Maxi,Where could it even go?!
473,19,3,Randy Marsh,Mayor?
474,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,I'm announcing a plan for SoDoSoPa. [presses a remote control and a picture of the logo comes up.] A new urban development that will turn the most rundown and dilapidated part of our town into a quaint center of artisan shops and cafes.
475,19,3,Randy Marsh,"Lots of cities are dong this. The area south of Downtown South Park has always been the ugly eyesore of this town. But now, SoDoSoPa... is going to bring in the fresh new vibrancy that Whole Foods can't ignore."
476,19,3,Architect,"We'll keep the existing structures, but add brick walkways and some quaint white lights. A plaza in the middle will be a place where young couples can play with their toddlers. [a shot of the site, which is Kenny's house, which has warped windows and broken stucco all around. Kenny hears the conversation and peeks out the front window] And it will all be small businesses like artisan cheese shops or noodle houses."
477,19,3,Randy Marsh,"Oh, this is really exciting. I thought this area was just gonna stay shitty forever. [Kenny walks to the kitchen, where he sees Stuart drinking a beer and reading a magazine.]"
478,19,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey Dad, there's these fucking people outside.)"
479,19,3,Stuart McCormick,"Who is? [gets up and walks to the front door, opens it and sees the group]"
480,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,So you think you'll keep all the existing structures?
481,19,3,Architect,I do. It's part of what gives a revitalized area like this its charm that the hipsters like.
482,19,3,Stuart McCormick,"Hey, what are you people doing?!"
483,19,3,Randy Marsh,We're gentrifying. It'sall good.
484,19,3,Randy Marsh,"Okay, hold on, everyone listen up! We understand that not everyone is for the town spending money on the SoDoSoPa project. We want everyone to be able to voice their concerns. [Only the McCormicks are present]"
485,19,3,Stuart McCormick,[stands up] Yeah I got concerns! I don't want you touching my damn house!
486,19,3,Johnson,"We realize that when a rejuvenation like this takes place, the lower-income residents fear they'll be priced out of the area."
487,19,3,Stuart McCormick,What lower-income residents?! Me?! I work hard and provide for my family just fine!
488,19,3,Randy Marsh,"Stuart, come on. Your house sucks."
489,19,3,Stuart McCormick,"Fuck you! If you people wanna turn somethin' into a vibrant arts district, then do it to Randy's house!"
490,19,3,Randy Marsh,My house is nice.
491,19,3,"Mayor McDaniels, Johnson, and Aide","Mr. McCormick, you will be living in the most vibrant part of the entire town. SoDoSoPa is the future of South Park."
492,19,3,Johnson,There will be amazing food and incredible shops right at your doorstep.
493,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,And we want to assure the lower-income families that we are going to take the time to do this right.
494,19,3,Waiter,"Alright guys, welcome to Steed. Do we have any allergies?"
495,19,3,Stephen Stotch,"No, nothing. And we we wanna try everything! [Det. Harris and Officer Barbrady are dining at another table]"
496,19,3,Det Harris,"Wow, can you believe this place?"
497,19,3,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah, the food is unbelievable. [Randy and Nelson are at the bar]"
498,19,3,Randy Marsh,"It's like a dream come true, Nelson. This area is gonna put our town on the map. [the camera pulls back and Steed is shown on the second floor of a mall that has been built on the McCormick house. A narrow entrance between the house and the garage leads to a patio where the backyard used to be, and there are more shops beyond that. Stuart steps outside and dumps his garbage in an aluminum trash can]"
499,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"I don't know what happen all my customers. I used to have a-people come in here, fill every table. Now it's like a-nobody want anything to do with my authentic shitty food. This town is changing so fast, you know? [a lone man sits by the window eating dinner. There are no other customers] This town is changing so fast, everybody wan be PC, be updated. It's like I'm a reric. A rost reric from another time. You know? I dunno, sometime I feel like I outstayed my welcome. Is just how I feel, you know?"
500,19,3,Diner,Uh huh.
501,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"It's like a-my accent make people uncomftable or something. How a Chinese man is supposed to survive in this world? [the door opens] Oh, welcome oh Shitty Wok, a take ur order prease?"
502,19,3,Man,"[turns left and walks up to the diner] Hey Mike, whatcha doin' man? The guys are all meetin' down at SoDoSoPa."
503,19,3,Mike,At what?
504,19,3,Man,"They've totally revitalized this area south of Downtown, you've gotta check it out! [turns and walks out]"
505,19,3,Mike,"Oh sweet, dude. [gets up and follows his friend out the door]"
506,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,SoDoSoPa? What the hell is a SoDoSoPa?
507,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,What the fuuuck!
508,19,3,Karen McCormick,"Mommy, can we go eat outside?"
509,19,3,Mom,"No, we can't go eat outside."
510,19,3,Karen McCormick,"But Mommy, they have ice cream. [points outside]"
511,19,3,Stuart McCormick,"We can't afford $10 ice cream, alright?! If you want nice things, then go out and get a JOB! Except you won't make MONEY! [Karen gets off the sofa with her head down and goes to her room] Because you just BUST your ASS and then barely get by while everyone around you gets RICHER! [Kenny glares at his dad, then gets up and follows Karen] Just face it: things are never gonna change around here."
512,19,3,Johnson,What's he gonna say?
513,19,3,Fr Maxi,Maybe they won't even answ- [the Mayor shushes them both as Randy waits for a pickup]
514,19,3,Randy Marsh,"Hi, um, yes, my name is Randy Marsh, and um, we would like to try and get a Whole Foods in our town? ... Yes, that's right. Aaah, yes, it's ah, South Park, Colorado. Nonononono! Nononononono! [continues this for some time] It's not at all what you think! Yes, it's where the Presidential candidate is from-Nonononono! Nononononono! Hold on! Hold on, hold on! SoDoSoPa! SoDoSoPa! We have a SoDoSoPa and the town is completely different! SoDoSoPa! We have an arts and entertainment district! Cultural! Yes. Okay. Okay, yes, I, I understand. Thank you. [hangs up and gathers his thoughts] They said they maybe might send over a representative. [a moment later everyone cheers. Randy hugs the Mayor.]"
515,19,3,Voice,"[Deep] There's a certain quality, vibe, and energy that is SoDoSoPa. From the independent merchants and unique cafes to the rustic charm of a mixed-income crowd. [the camera pans to Kenny and Stuart, who are annoyed. A couple is dancing at Savor the Goodness as Kevin and Karen look on through a window. Their mom comes up and pulls the blinds down, then back to live action] Where else can you let loose your wild side while still being a part of helping the local economy? [a shot of the whole family looking out at the diners. The parents are mad] And now, a chance to own a piece of this most exciting area of South Park. Announcing: the Lofts at SoDoSoPa. Two thousand square foot of flats that will put you right in the heart of it all. After a night out eating and shopping in SoDoSoPa, just take a few steps and you're home. With modern styling these lofts are sleek, sexy, and oh so SoDoSoPa. And for those very privileged few, the most private and exclusive ownership opportunity is here. Announcing the Residences at the Lofts at SoDoSoPa. Now you can have access to luxury refined while still just steps away from the action. These finely appointed residences all feature state-of-the art finishes and balconies with views of historic Kenny's house. It's a place to laugh. It's a place to gather. A place to mingle with people of all economic classes. And now, it's a place to live. SoDoSoPa. Welcome Home."
516,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"And we are going to take a-business back from a-SoDoSoPa! [notices Kenny with the sign] Ah, hello, you here for job? Prease join the others prease. [he already has a crew of seven kids. Kenny joins the crew] Some say I cannot survive in today's world. But if there's one asset that a Chinese man has, it's the tactical use of a child rabor. And together, child rabor force, we are gong to bring a SoDoSoPa to its knees."
517,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"This is it, people! This is what we've all been working for! The future of our town depends on us being on our best behavior! No swearing, no weirdness, and no speeches! [everyone looks at Kyle, who motions as if to say something]"
518,19,3,Johnson,He's coming!
519,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,Go! go! Everyone in place! [all the adults gather by Tom's Rhinoplasty]
520,19,3,Townsman,"Oh look! [a female conductor leads the kids in a rendition of ""He's Got The Whole World In His Hands"" A car pulls up and a Whole Foods Market representative steps out. At this point, the song ends]"
521,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"[approaches] Hello, sir. On behalf of everyone here in South Park, please let me say we are very excited to be in consideration-"
522,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"[ignores her] Everyone, please go about your business! I need to see this town in its normal goings on, to see if it is indeed a Whole Foods town."
523,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"[comes in from the left side] Okay, rooking good, child rabor force. [claps three times] We gonna make a Shitty Wok a updated and a beautiful. [heads back towards the kitchen and sings]
Let's go child rabor force, let's go! [returns to the dining area] No no, Dennis, you don't use a too much cleaner on the table. That stuff expensive. Now risten everybody! This is a big day! We gonna take the business back from a-SoDoSoPa! And how we gonna do it, child rabor force?! That's right, by taking pride in our work! With the way this prace is looking, we gonna have people rushing in any second!"
524,19,3,Man 2,"[voice only] Okay, everyone go about your business."
525,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,Oh! Here they come!
526,19,3,Man 3,"[voice only] Everyone act normal. No, don't act normal, act good!"
527,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"There they go. [runs to the entrance] Wait, wait! [runs outside] Shitty Wok! Take ur order prease?! Take ur- [quiet voice, as no one comes back] Take ur order ... prease? [a different camera angle shows a Red Lobster across the street from City Wok and Skeeter's Bar and Cocktails down the road.]"
528,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,The previous principal of the school was let go so that someone more progressive could take over.
529,19,3,PC Principal,"[stands up] Hey bro, I'm the new principal of the school. My name's PC Principal."
530,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,P.C. Principal. I like that. So you've just recently moved here?
531,19,3,PC Principal,That's right.
532,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,And do you believe this town is deserving of a Whole Foods?
533,19,3,PC Principal,"You know, I think it's changed a lot. I really do. I've seen some real progress. Definitely had some holdouts - people who went kicking and screaming into 2015, but yes, I think they deserve it."
534,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,Mmmmm-hm. [turns around] Show me a classroom please.
535,19,3,Teacher,"But if Pluto isn't a planet, who can tell me what it is? [the door opens and the Mayor and representative walk in] Oh, hello."
536,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,This is our new fourth-grade teacher. She's very normal and professional.
537,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,Please continue as if I am not here.
538,19,3,Teacher,"Okay, so uhh children, anyone wanna tell me what Pluto is classified as? [the Whole Foods Rep walks across the floor towards the windows] Anybody? Okay. [the Whole Foods Rep walks back] Well, Pluto is actually a dwarf planet. [Kyle and Stan look at each other] That means it's neither a planet nor a natural satellite, okay?"
539,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"[to the Mayor] Is there a reason why the children with disabilities and black child are front and center? [""...like the moon. Who can tell me how big the moon is?""]"
540,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh no, that's just where they always sit, next to our beloved Craig there, who is a homosexual. [Craig hears this and looks at her angrily. ""Is it bigger? Smaller? Anyone wanna take a guess""]"
541,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,Mmmmm-hm.
542,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Uh, can, can I show you the most exciting part of town?"
543,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"This is historic SoDoSoPa. It's our vibrant and charming arts and foods district. [Kenny is shown coming home from school. He opens the door, sees them, goes inside, and slams the door shut]"
544,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"Hmmm, I enjoy how you've retained the lower-income housing with the updated and quaint urban developments."
545,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,That's really what our town is about. [Randy arrives with Stephen]
546,19,3,Randy Marsh,"Oh, hello again. Stephen and I were just heading to SoDoSoPa to enjoy some specialty foods. [the Whole Foods Rep turns around and looks at the vast open area across the street, and begins to survey it. Randy nudges Stephen a few times]"
547,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,Hmmm. I have seen enough for today. I am weary. Where shall I sleep?
548,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh yes, of course, uh..."
549,19,3,Randy Marsh,"Uh, well, tonight, you're at our Motel 6. But, we'd like to show you the plans for something extremely exciting."
550,19,3,Voice,"You can't say ""excitement"" without saying ""SoDoSoPa."" The food, the art, the nightlife. With the Lofts and Residences at SoDoSoPa all the action was just a few steps away. But what if you could actually live in the most central location that SoDoSoPa has to offer? Well, now you can. Announcing: the Villas at Kenny's House. The most sought-after address in all of South Park for only the very privileged few. Now you can relax in your state-of-the-art deck spa while taking in views of that mixed SoDoSoPa culture. [a view of the back of Kenny's house. Stuart and his wife are fighting, and the new neighbors can see it]"
551,19,3,Stuart McCormick,"Shut your damn mouth, bitch!"
552,19,3,Mom,You shut your mouth or I'll shut-
553,19,3,Voice,"But that's not all. The Villas at Kenny's house will also feature access to a private fitness center, clubhouse, and so much more. Plus a breezeway to the proposed Whole Foods just steps away. [PROPOSED WHOLE FOODS NOT YET CONFIRMED] The Villas at Kenny's House. Welcome Home."
554,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Hey, that's okay. We close. All the other child labor go home."
555,19,3,Kenny McCormick,[stops mopping] (I just wanna make sure I get the floors as clean as I can.)
556,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"I like you, Dennis. You work a real hard. [hands Kenny a dollar] I wish I could give you more. You deserve more. [walks over to a window] But I think I'm gonna have to shut down. Now that a SoDoSoPa open, I'm the shitty part of town. And everyone hates the shitty part of town."
557,19,3,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah. I know what you mean.)
558,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh, what do you know about living in the shitty part of town, Dennis?"
559,19,3,Kenny McCormick,"[drops the mop] (Hey, I have an idea.)"
560,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,You have idea?
561,19,3,Kenny McCormick,(I actually do!)
562,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,Oh! That's the spirit! Let's go child rabor! [clap clap clapclapclap] Let's go child rabor! [they both clap clap clapclapclap]
563,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,So these are the cattle that the local shops and restaurants are supplied with.
564,19,3,Rancher,"Uh... these are local cows, yes."
565,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,And where does the butchery take place?
566,19,3,Rancher,"Uh, that's right over there. [a ranch hand shoots a cow in the head, killing it on the spot]"
567,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,And are the bullets made from reclaimed metals?
568,19,3,Mayor McDaniels,"I believe they are. Rancher, could you make sure?"
569,19,3,Fr Maxi,"Randy, Stephen, we've got a big problem! The owner of City Wok has child labor making videos for him!"
570,19,3,Richard Tweek,What??
571,19,3,Randy Marsh,Oh Jesus! We forgot all about that guy!
572,19,3,Bob Black,[sees the Whole Foods Rep turn around and nudges Randy] Shhh!
573,19,3,Fr Maxi,It's all over the place. He's tryin' to revitalize his rundown neighborhood! [the Mayor follows the rep's gaze]
574,19,3,Randy Marsh,"God, why do the economically challenged always have to screw up everything?! [turns around to face the Mayor] We're gonna head back to SoDoSoPa for some curious fusion delights. [turns around and leads the other three men away] Come on, we'll get that asshole!"
575,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"There's a new and exciting prace where people can gather to shop, experience and grow. This is an all-new food and nightrife district. This, is CtPaTown. Where else but CtPaTown can you get all the shitty hot spots and shitty food that South Park is known for? In the mood for some local seafood? Red Robster has all the freshest from Colorado's many oceans. Or if a handcrafted ale is more your thing, head on down to Skeeter's Bar for local ales like a Coors and a Coors Rite. And then, of course, there's Shitty Wok, South Park's historic Asian fusion randmark, featuring Shitty Chicken and Shitty Sour Soup. The state-of-the-art toiret is designed for men and women [just a regular toilet and bathroom. No urinal] and is a great prace for you to squeeze out all the shitty food you've enjoyed. Now South Park has another neighborhood to mingle and rerax. CtPaTown. Welcome Home."
576,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh boy, get ready child rabor force! Any minute now, we gonna have a-customers up our ass!"
577,19,3,Townfolk,Get him! There he is! That son of a bitch! Get him! Stop him!
578,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh boy, here they come! [turns to Kenny] You were right, Dennis! CtPaTown commercial did the trick! [heads back to the counter and turns around] Get ready for customers, child rabor force! [the adults rush in and fan out] Welcome Shitty Wok, take your order PREASE. [Fr. Maxi takes Tuong Lu Kim, Officer Barbrady takes Kenny]"
579,19,3,Kenny McCormick,(What. The. Fuck?!) [the other adults take the rest of the kids. They all rush out of the restaurant]
580,19,3,Randy Marsh,"Alright, take these kids and hide them in the-"
581,19,3,Kenny McCormick,"(Come on, dude, I've gotta make some money!)"
582,19,3,Randy Marsh,Ow! You little-! [kicks Kenny down]
583,19,3,Girl,Get him! [a massive fight breaks out between the adults and the child labor force]
584,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Fight, child rabor force! Swing to the reft!"
585,19,3,Whole Foods Rep,"[shows up with the Mayor and clears his throat] Ahem, ahem! [all the fighting stops and Mayor McDaniels is dismayed at this bad behavior. The adults put the kids down and smile, the kids stay as they are] I've never seen a town put so much energy into displaying an exaggerated sense of social consciousness. Congratulations, you have your Whole Foods. [the adults cheer and disperse.]"
586,19,3,Tuong Lu Kim,"Wait wait, anybody want a Shitty Chicken?? Anybody?? Take ur order prease??? [jumps a few times in frustration, then sighs] I'm sorry, Dennis. You rearry tried to help. I guess it's over. Come on inside. I'll pay you the child labor wage you deserve."
587,19,3,Stuart McCormick,[cynically] Well? Did you make any money?
588,19,3,Kenny McCormick,"[stops and looks down] (No, I didn't make any money.) [continues to the bedrooms]"
589,19,3,Stuart McCormick,"Ha, told ya! That's how it works in this damned country."
590,19,3,Karen McCormick,"[whispers as Kenny goes to her bed] What are you doing, Kenny? [Kenny takes off his backpack and opens it, pulling out a blonde Mama Baby doll. He hands it to her and she gasps in anticipation] Wow! This is mine?"
591,19,3,Kenny McCormick,"[pats her knee] (It's yours, Karen.) [closes his backpack and puts it on, then leaves the bedroom. He stops to look at Karen take the doll out of its box]"
592,19,3,Karen McCormick,"Hi. [Kenny closes the door and goes to his own room. He drops the backpack on the floor and goes straight to bed. Life outside at SoDoSoPa bustles on, with the thumping music.]"
593,19,3,Voice,"There's a time when a town becomes more than it was. [Someone pours himself some coffee. Butters and Linda look at cakes. Mr. Mackey is chatting with the Mayor] When the people take that bold step into making things better. [a bearded worker glances at the camera. Craig points out some deli meats to him mom] To progress. [a shot of two child workers and their mother] To change. [another child worker and his parents] To not be what you were in the past. [a boy and his parents. Wendy glides by on her skateboard] This is a new place, ready for the next decade. [Sharon and Linda walk out with groceries] Updated, revitalized, [Kenny opens his front door and looks out. SoDoSoPa is abandoned, its signs falling down] and ready to fit in with the most progressive towns in America. [PC Principal lowers his Oakleys a bit and nods at the camera] This... is South Park. [a shot of the Mayor and Randy, with a few families, facing the camera at Whole Foods. Cartman and Kyle are in the background] Welcome Home."
594,19,3,Eric Cartman,Are the Mexicans actually staying?
595,19,3,Kyle Broflovski,Shhhh.
596,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Mornin' Randy!
597,19,4,Randy Marsh,"Mornin' Ger! Just another day in paradise, huh?"
598,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Yeah. Look at all the new restaurants the Whole Foods has brought in. [turns around and points at the restaurant behind them.] Let's try out that one there. [they walk towards it and reach the entrance. A greeter awaits them]
599,19,4,Randy Marsh,Hi. Two of us. please?
600,19,4,Greeter,"Yeah, sorry guys. we got about a thirty minute wait."
601,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[switches places with Randy] Oh, uh, scuse me. [whispers into the greeter's ear]"
602,19,4,Greeter,"Yes, sir, give me a second; I'll have a table right away. [rolls his eyes and walks off]"
603,19,4,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, what'd you say to him?"
604,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,I just... told him who I am.
605,19,4,Randy Marsh,Who are you?
606,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[whips out his phone and shows Randy the Yelp app] I'm a yelp reviewer. I usually keep it on the down-low so they don't kiss my ass too much.
607,19,4,Greeter,"[returns and gets two menus] Right over here, sir. [takes them to their seats]"
608,19,4,Waiter,"Alright guys, welcome to (vernacular)"
609,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Thanks, uh, did they mention to you that I am a Yelper?"
610,19,4,Waiter,"Yes, we've been alerted. Sir."
611,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Greeeat. Could you have them turn up the lights a little, please? [the waiter goes away]"
612,19,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh, look at it, Gerald. All the new families moving in. [a new Mexican restaurant - Nueva Familia - is having its grand opening across the street] Our little town is all grown up.
[Nueva Familia, across the street. A family-run restaurant. A boy sweeps up in the kitchen as his mother prepares some tacos on the griddle. His father rushes in.]"
613,19,4,Father,Where's that other taco plate? We need it now.
614,19,4,Mother,I'm a little overwhelmed.
615,19,4,Father,"I know. But we've put everything into moving here and starting this business, and we have to be impressive. [walks up to the boy and gets down on one knee] David, you must help your mama however you can. We're not going back to that miserable place!"
616,19,4,David,I don't wanna go back either.
617,19,4,Mother,"Okay, done."
618,19,4,Father,Great! [rises and goes for the plates] We really have to impress this customer. He's a local food critic. [rushes the plates out to the dining area]
619,19,4,Mother,Another one?
620,19,4,Father,"[rushes to his table with two plates of food] Okay, here you go, amigo! Another taco plate and the taquitos."
621,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, thank you. And, uh did I mention I am a food critic for Yelp?"
622,19,4,Father,"Yes, you mentioned that several times."
623,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, I just didn't want you caught off-guard. [whips out his phone] I was thinking of giving this place 5 stars."
624,19,4,Father,Really?
625,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[wiping his mouth clean with his napkin] Yeah, but I'm kind of teetering on 5 stars or 1 star."
626,19,4,Father,"Ohnono. No 1 star, please. What could we do to-?"
627,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Ah I mean, I could probably be persuaded with some free desserts."
628,19,4,Father,Let me get that for you.
629,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Great, and can you turn down the music a bit? [taps his left ear a few times] This pagan shit hurts my ears."
630,19,4,Father,"Of course! [turns around and hurries away. A spritz is heard, and the camera shows David wiping down a table. Cartman notices]"
631,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh hey, hey busboy. Busboy busboy, por favor. [snaps his fingers and whistles] Busboy!"
632,19,4,David,My name is David. (Dah-veed)
633,19,4,Eric Cartman,Ehexcuse me?
634,19,4,David,I said my name is David. (Dah-veed)
635,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Uhh, it's actually pronounced ""David,"" okay?"
636,19,4,David,"Well, I'm ""David."" (Dah-veed)"
637,19,4,Eric Cartman,"It's ""David,"" dude. Look it up."
638,19,4,Father,"[comes out with a flan and a sundae on a plate] What's going on? Do not argue, son. We need him. [walks to Cartman's table and sets the desserts down] Here you are, a few free desserts. [the front door opens and some bells are heard] Ho, excuse me. More customers! [goes away]"
639,19,4,Male food critic,"[enters with his wife] Hi, two of us for lunch, please."
640,19,4,Father,"Yes, right away!"
641,19,4,Male food critic,"Oh, and uh, I just wanted to mention that my wife and I are Yelp reviewers, so uh, your best table, please."
642,19,4,Father,"Oh Jeez, you guys too, huh? Ho-kay, uhm, I'll get you set up right over here, okay? [takes them past Cartman, who casts a critical eye]"
643,19,4,Eric Cartman,Mmmhmmm! [The father takes them to a booth near Cartman]
644,19,4,Male food critic,"Hm, this place seems, nice."
645,19,4,Female food critic,I guess we'll see.
646,19,4,Male food critic,"D'I guess we'll see, won't we?"
647,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, now everyone thinks they're a food critic."
648,19,4,Butters Stotch,Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Did you get 'em? Huh?
649,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[wearing a T-shirt that says ""WARNING: YELP critic"" on the front] Here you go. [takes a bag out of his back pocket and hands it to Butters]"
650,19,4,Butters Stotch,Whoooaaa. [opens the bag and begins eating what's inside.]
651,19,4,Eric Cartman,Crispy risotto bites from Olive Garden.
652,19,4,Butters Stotch,"How do you do it, Eric?"
653,19,4,Eric Cartman,"I'm a restaurant critic, Butters. I get whatever I want."
654,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Jeeeeezzz. [a second later, Kyle walks by with David]"
655,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,"So the cafeteria's back that way, and most of the classrooms are this way, down the-."
656,19,4,Eric Cartman,EEWW. [Kyle and David face him] What's the busboy doing here?
657,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,David is new to our school.
658,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, cool. Are you gonna clean the tables here too? How do you get to school? [mimics a boy on a bicycle] Do you ride your tiny bicicleta? Huh?"
659,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,Shut up.
660,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Look amigo, I'm sorry I only gave your parents' restaurant two stars, but it could have been worse."
661,19,4,David,Why'd you only give them two stars?
662,19,4,Eric Cartman,"I'm sorry, but the food totally messed my stomach up. The morning after I ate it I went to the bathroom and my poop was all solid. Like no water at all."
663,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,It's not supposed to have water you-!
664,19,4,Eric Cartman,"It was like this one solid piece that I had to... push out my asshole. It was like being raped from the inside. Your parents' restaurant just wasn't up to my standards, David."
665,19,4,David,David.  (Dah-veed)
666,19,4,Eric Cartman,David.
667,19,4,David,Dah-vd.
668,19,4,Eric Cartman,David.
669,19,4,David,Dah-vd.
670,19,4,Eric Cartman,"David David David David! I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude. [David turns around and walks away. Kyle turns around, looks at Cartman, and follows David away. A few second later Cartman relaxes] ...Oohhhh God I love being a restaurant critic."
671,19,4,Gerald s review,"And yet, there was more. For in this crisp time when autumn begins to fade, the chef brings chicken in habanero, and even adds habanero powder to the crust. But the heat is restrained. You experience the fruity, delicious flavor of this without any spicy pain. I don't need any more pain. Hell, does anyone?"
672,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[appears at the den doorway with Ike] Gerald! We're going to the park. You wanna come along?
673,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Sorry honey, this review for Applebee's has turned into a fifty-pager. And then I have a polish on Ruby Tuesday's."
674,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Why don't you take a break from Yelping, Gerald? You seem a little overwhelmed."
675,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[leans back on his chair] I am, overwhelmed. Sometimes I don't know what I've gotten myself into. But now everyone relies on my Yelp reviews and I... I don't wanna let anyone down."
676,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Well there's chicken in the fridge if you get hungry.
677,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Thanks, but I, I've gotta Yelp a new place in CtPaTown tonight. [leans forward a bit] God I'm so damned tired."
678,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Okay. Have fun.
679,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[to himself]Ha, ""fun,"" she says."
680,19,4,Gerald s review,"In finality, I will say that my experience at Applebee's was sublime and my treatment near that of a gladiator most decorated. But the street parking wasn't that great. Two and a half stars."
681,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[satisfied with his review Gerald leans back in his chair again commenting to himself] Yes.
682,19,4,Wendy Testaburger,"Come on, Liza, I'll introduce you to the girls."
683,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Well aren't you eatin' lunch, Eric?"
684,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Uhuh, I'm a food critic, Butters, okay? I can't just eat cafeteria food."
685,19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"O-okay, Here you are sir! There's orange-peel chicken, some uh shity beef, and uh shitty egg roll!"
686,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,Are you joking?!
687,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Well, you are a little late, like, I dunno, maybe only [emphasis] one star late."
688,19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"Oh no! No one star, prease! You Uelpers are kriwing me! Okay, you no pay! You no pay, prease!"
689,19,4,Eric Cartman,Sounds good. Now get the fuck out of here.
690,19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,Yes yes. I get the fuck out. Thank you! [hurries away]
691,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Wow! Well you're pretty important, Eric."
692,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,He's not important. At. All.
693,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Yes, no no, you you're right, Kyle. I'm not important. Oh, hey David, I was just wondering, um, how do you get to school? Do you... ride your tiny bicicleta? Eh?"
694,19,4,Stan Marsh,Stop it.
695,19,4,Eric Cartman,"What? I just want to hear him say ""S, me ride me tiny bicicleta to schooool."""
696,19,4,David,"S, me ride me teeny bicicleta to school."
697,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[laughs] That's awesome! [turns around on the bench] I'm gonna go out to recess. Will you bus this for me, David. Thanks. [leaves the table. David leaves his seat]"
698,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah, [facepalm] don't, dude, dude- Don't."
699,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","Sir, it's midnight. Go home, get some sleep."
700,19,4,Sgt Yates,There's no time to sleep when the city's counting on me.
701,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","More Yelp reviews, sir?"
702,19,4,Sgt Yates,"I had a bad experience at Red Lobster and if the people don't know about it, they could too. Folks deserve to know where to eat, Mitch."
703,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",But does anyone even thank you for it?
704,19,4,Sgt Yates,"I don't need them to. I know they need me, and that's enough."
705,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","[pats him on the left shoulder] God bless you, sir."
706,19,4,Sgt Yates,I know. [Barkley walks away]
707,19,4,Whistlin Willy,Welcome to Whistlin' Willy's. Y'all enjoyin' your pizza?
708,19,4,Male food critic,"Look here, my good man, we've been waiting over 15 minutes for you to sing Happy Birthday to our son!"
709,19,4,Female food critic,"Unfortunately for you, we are both restaurant critics, and so is our son!"
710,19,4,Son,[gets an angry face] One star!
711,19,4,Diner 1,"Excuse me! Emergency! [Whistlin' Willy rushes over to see what's up] Over here! Emergency! I would like a table. Inside the area with all the little plastic balls please, and make it snappy I am a food critic for Yelp."
712,19,4,Whistlin Willy,That does it! I've had enough! All you Yelp reviewers get the hell outta here! I don't care what happens to my business! I ain't kissing your asses no more! [moves the male food critic from the table to the double doors on his chair and throws him against the doors] Go on! Every Yelper get the fuck out of here!
713,19,4,Diner 2,"Careful now, Bill, you don't want a one-star review."
714,19,4,Whistlin Willy,"You're not a food critic, Dennis! You're a fuckin' mechanic! Now get the fuck out! Go on! All you Yelpin' sons of bitches get the fuck out of here! [Yelpers begin to stream out of the restaurant]"
715,19,4,Male food critic,"You're gonna regret this, Whistlin' Willy. You can't treat Yelpers this way."
716,19,4,Whistlin Willy,You get the f- Get the fuck out! [kicks the male food critic in the ass for emphasis as the critic goes out the door.]
717,19,4,Male food critic,AH! [Whistlin' Willy slams the door shut. Gerald shows up a few seconds later]
718,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Well, good for you."
719,19,4,Whistlin Willy,"You too, you sonofabitch!"
720,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Whoa! Hey! [Whistlin' Willy kicks him out too, and Gerald rubs his butt outside]"
721,19,4,Tuong Lu Kim,"It's oba! It's oba! [screams some more and approaches Nueva Familia.] You see papaa?! It's oba! [David's father steps outside and Mr. Kim stops him] Whistrin' Wirry! He stand up to the Yelpas! [David's father scans the front page] We don't have to kiss uh their asses anymore! Look! [David's mother comes out to join his father] Everyone is doing the same! [signs go up saying ""No Yelpers""] Ha haha. It's ova it's ova! Hey Skeetah, you hear the news?! [He runs off continuing his celebration]"
722,19,4,Father,[softly] It's a ...miracle. [jubilantly] IT'S A MIRACLE! [he and his wife hug]
723,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Hm hm hm the fuck? [notices a small puddle on the floor] Aw, dude, somebody spilled shit on the floor! [notices David at his locker] Hey David, somebody spilled something here. Could you clean this up, por favor? David. [whistles] Over here, there's some shit on the floor. [David closes his locker and turns away] Heyheyhey hey! What's goin' on, man?"
724,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,[arriving] You haven't heard? Nobody gives a fuck what Yelp reviewers think anymore.
725,19,4,Eric Cartman,"What are you talking about? I'm the most influential critic in this town. Okay David, forget the spill, just give me one little ""My name is David. Me ride me biciceta to schoool"""
726,19,4,David,My name... is David.  (Dah-veed)[walks off]
727,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,HA! [walks off as well]
728,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[whips out his phone] Okay, I'm uh I'm updating my review. I'm about to do it. [waits for a comeback but doesn't get one] You'd better say ""I ride me bicicleta to school""! [holds up his phone] One star! ... No s-no stars? [no reply. He sighs and tries again] No stars? ... You can't just treat me like I'm nothing... I still know I'm worth something! Come on, guys! [walks away. No one follows him. Seconds later he's back.] Oh yeah, y-you guys stay in school, that's kewl, you guys stay here. [leaves again]"
729,19,4,Butters Stotch,"[noticing] Oh, hey Eric."
730,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[hops onto Butters' bed and lays down] It's all over, Butters. Everything I've worked so hard to achieve. All these hack wannabe food critics have made my profession a joke."
731,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Oh I'm sorry, bud."
732,19,4,Eric Cartman,All these people trying to be like me. And they don't even write about poop consistency the next day.
733,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Well Eric, you should be proud that people wanna be like you. Ha ah, I mean, you really started something."
734,19,4,Eric Cartman,I guess.
735,19,4,Butters Stotch,"Well if these people look up to you, maybe, maybe you can sort of, set the record straight and show them the way it's supposed to be done."
736,19,4,Eric Cartman,"[sits up] You're right, Butters. Maybe I can actually use all these people somehow to make... real food critics respected again."
737,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","Harrison Yates, what's gotten into you?"
738,19,4,Yates,"That's it, Maggie. I'm hanging it up. If people are gonna be trying all the new restaurants in town they'll... have to do it without my reviews."
739,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",What are ya talkin' about? You said that protectin' people from bad dinin' experiences was what kept you goin'.
740,19,4,Yates,"The restaurants put up signs sayin' I can't come in. I don't know why they singled me out, but it's like, people don't need me. [opens a letter and reads it] Well I'll be damned."
741,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",What is it?
742,19,4,Yates,Somebody's put a note in the mailbox... asking me to come and talk to them. They do need me. [rises and goes to the coat rack] I need to get goin'.
743,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",You want me to come along?
744,19,4,Yates,"No, they're just asking for me. I guess... [opens the front door] maybe I do have a town to protect. [smiles and leaves]"
745,19,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, are you having a party sweetheart?"
746,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Not a part, Mom. I've invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting."
747,19,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh, how fun!"
748,19,4,Eric Cartman,"It's not fun, it's serious. These people think they can do what I do, but they need to be, made to understand the reality. When the Yelpers get here I need you to get lost, okay? Okay, that's them, that's them. Go, get lost, Mom! [she goes away as he walks to the front door. He opens the door and sees a sea of reviewers]"
749,19,4,Yelpers,"Hello, hi. My name is [they all give their names at the same time] and I'm here for the meeting. [Cartman freezes up]"
750,19,4,A reviewer,Is this the right place?
751,19,4,Eric Cartman,Fuuuuuuck! [closes the door and keeps it closed with his back] Mom!
752,19,4,Liane Cartman,"I'm going, honey."
753,19,4,Eric Cartman,"But Mom, there's like a billion people here."
754,19,4,Liane Cartman,"Oh yes, sweetie, I think quite a few people are Yelp reviewers."
755,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on Yelp?!"
756,19,4,Liane Cartman,"I guess so, honey. Do you need more lemonade?"
757,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Mom, there's a fucking billion people here! [yes, Yelpers all up and down the block, filling the streets all around. Moments later, he appears at his bedroom window on the second floor, and holds court] Uh, thank you all for coming. My name is Eric, and as you know, us Yelpers are being scrutinized-"
758,19,4,A Yelper,COULD YOU SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER?
759,19,4,Eric Cartman,Yes. Us Yelp critics are being scrutinized.
760,19,4,Other Yelpers,That's right! Yeah!
761,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Now, you see, the problem is that when there's too many reviewers, people no longer know who is the real food critic. [Sgt. Yates puffs up his chest, pretty sure that it's him] It's great that you all want to be critics, but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is."
762,19,4,Other Yelpers,That's right. Yeah!
763,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,[confidently humble] Huh. Oh thanks.
764,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay. So, as long as there is one clear leader, then the rest of you can just follow. And with this many people all following [holds up index finger] one captain, we can fight to get our power back!"
765,19,4,A Yelper,Poweerrrrr Back!
766,19,4,Eric Cartman,"So now rise up, and [pounds on the window sill] fight for your leader!! Fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter!"
767,19,4,Other Yelpers,Yeah! Let's go! [more cheering from the Yelpers]
768,19,4,Sgt Yates,"Alright, follow me!"
769,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"This way, everyone! [the crowd turns left and moves off]"
770,19,4,Anchor Tom and Reporter,"Another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by Yelp reviewers. Whistlin' Willy's, a child favorite in town, was destroyed and its owner stripped and beheaded. The following video is graphic. [a crowd of Yelp reviewers is shown and they are ululating. Two Yelpers bring Whistlin' Willy in front of the camera and hold him there. The crowd continues to ululate]"
771,19,4,Whistlin Willy,"No, please! No! Nonono! [the Yelpers pull the mask off his head and show it off to the camera] Awwww. [the ululating continues]"
772,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,We all... loved... Whistlin' Willy's!
773,19,4,Eric Cartman,[just shrugs] It didn't do well with Yelpers.
774,19,4,Token Black,You assholes destroyed the best place in town because they wouldn't kiss your asses!
775,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh come on, admit it. The food sucked."
776,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody went for the fucking food!
777,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Look, I'm sorry goys, but Whistlin' Willy failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business. Now, I just have one question for you, David. Do you ride... your teeny, tiny, bicicleta... to school?"
778,19,4,David,"Si. Me ride me teeny bicicleta to school. [turns around and walks away. Kyle flashes an angry look at Cartman, then watches David leave]"
779,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,[gets in Cartman's face] You're done! [turns around and walks away with the remaining boys]
780,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm done! I'm now the leader of thousands of people! They all hang on my every word! [softly] And I'm gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs."
781,19,4,Gerald s review,"I found the wait staff at Red Lobster to be rude, and barely even acknowledging who I was. Or what I meant to this city."
782,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"[appears at the doorway with Ike] Gerald, I'm taking Ike to clown school. You care to joing us?"
783,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"I can't, honey. I'm now the leader of thousands of people. They all hang on my every word. And I'm going to use my power to finally get what this town really needs. [Sheila and Ike just walk away]"
784,19,4,Anchor Tom and Reporter,"For the fifth day in a row, historic Shi Tpa Town is under siege by Yelp reviewers. The restaurants are still refusing to be intimidated. and the Yelp reviewers are- [quickly ducks as the gunfire hits very close to him] -and the Yelp reviewers are preparing for all-out war. [real war footage is shown] The angry Yelp reviewers are demanding special treatment at all city restaurants. They claim that as local food critics they reserve respect, and that all who oppose them will suffer. The online restaurant critics are getting ready to bring businesses to their knees, and some are already closing their doors. [Nueva Familia is shown...]"
785,19,4,Anchor Tom and Reporter,One local restaurant worker actually called out the Yelp critics' leader.
786,19,4,David,"I guess you win, huh, big shot?! If you really are any kind of important to anybody, then get your bullshit food critic ass to the south of town and face me! Because you aren't a food critic, and you aren't important! [Sgt. Yates looks at the screen in the police station] And unless you're a chicken, I'll see you south of town! [Yates walks into his office and gets his coat]"
787,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley","Where are you going, sir?"
788,19,4,Sgt Yates,"You heard him. Little Mexican kid called me out. [shows his gun, then places it back in its holster] If he wants to fight me, that's fine."
789,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",You need backup sir?
790,19,4,Sgt Yates,"No, he's just calling me out. [turns and walks out]"
791,19,4,"Sgt. Yates, Maggie Yates, and Officer Barkley",God bless you sir.
792,19,4,Sgt Yates,I know!
793,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,"David! Dude, wait! [Kyle is next to him now] Dude, you don't wanna do this. You don't know what Cartman's capable of."
794,19,4,David,"Where I come from, we settle things with our fists!"
795,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,But this isn't Mexico.
796,19,4,David,"I'm not from Mexico, dude! I'm from Idaho! [Kyle glances away, embarrassed] I'm gonna show this prick how we do things in Boise!"
797,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hello David! [Cartman is flanked by hundreds of Helpers]"
798,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, you've got your army! You've got your followers! If you're such a great leader, then just tell the city what you want, fat-ass!"
799,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Don't call me fat, son! I'm doing this because they've-"
800,19,4,Sgt Yates,What I want is to be able to lead these fine people with the respect and the dignity-
801,19,4,Yelper 1,"I didn't ask to be the leader, I was appointed! You see, I'm extremely important to this town, and I'm not going to be-"
802,19,4,Yelper 2,"My journey is this town's food- [soon everyone is talking over each other, and David and Kyle just look at each other.]"
803,19,4,Yelper 3,"You've made these people feel unwanted, and now they look to me for answers."
804,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Now here I stand, vulnerable, afraid, and yet willing to do what the people of this-"
805,19,4,Male food critic,"And so we said ""to hell with it!"" And we took the challenge to go from the town's food critics to the town's spiritual leaders! What do we want?"
806,19,4,Yelper 4,"[another woman] People would say ""Oh, you're just a food blogger. You're just a tiny voice in the crowd. Well now my voice is heard, and I will-"" [her voice melts into the other voices]"
807,19,4,Eric Cartman,"...wanted special privileges, but these people think I should have them! Right, guys? Maybe I don't deserve special treatment, but how else can I be the elite food critic they want? [more chatter]"
808,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,[after a few moments] Every person here thinks this is about them.
809,19,4,David,I think I know what to do.
810,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Me too.
811,19,4,Mayor McDaniels,"And for all your service to this community, we want to once and for all declare you our most elite food critic. To distinguish you, we present to you... the Golden Badge. [an aide pins the badge on Gerald's coat] Wearing this badge means you will always get the special treatment that you deserve. [Johnson rings a bell and Fr. Maxi hums a short chant]"
812,19,4,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Thank you, Mayor. It's a big responsibility, but I suppose I have to accept. I will do my best to serve this town."
813,19,4,Mayor McDaniels,We know you will. [shows him the exit. He turns right and walks out. Another aide closes the exit door]
814,19,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, bring in the next one."
815,19,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Davis, you have proven yourself a leader. And for all your service to this community, we want to once and for all declare you our most elite food critic. To distinguish you, we present the Golden Badge. [an aide pins the badge on Mr. Davis's coat]"
816,19,4,Mr Davis,[softly] Wwooww.
817,19,4,Mayor McDaniels,Wearing this badge means you will always get the special treatment you deserve. [Johnson rings the bell and Fr. Maxi hums the short chant]
818,19,4,David,"Alright, we got all the restaurants to agree to let the Yelpers in and make them feel special."
819,19,4,Father,"How did you do it, son?"
820,19,4,Diner 3,"Hi, yes, the steak, please. [points to his golden badge] I'm the uh Yelp elite. [the waiter takes his order to the kitchen and...]"
821,19,4,Waiter,"Alright, we got a Yelper. Give it that special attention."
822,19,4,(vernacular) Chef,"Youuu got it! [puts his finger into his nose and pulls out some boogers, and smears them on the steak.]"
823,19,4,Lead Singer,"So you're one of Yelpers' special blessed.
You demand a restaurant's very best.
Well they're gonna treat you special, I'm tellin' you, chum.
Now get yourself ready for some boogers and cum!"
824,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
825,19,4,Lead Singer,That's called the Yelper Special!
826,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
827,19,4,Lead Singer,"Say, what's that on your pretzel?"
828,19,4,Lead Singer,Your online critiques are real useful to some.
829,19,4,Backup Singers,Oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo
830,19,4,Lead Singer,Now have a good time eatin' boogers and cum.
831,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
832,19,4,Lead Singer,Someone farted on your salad.
833,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
834,19,4,Lead Singer,But your dcor critiques are valid.
835,19,4,Lead Singer,"You think you're special, like you're A #1!"
836,19,4,Backup Singers,Oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo
837,19,4,Lead Singer,Well there's a whole lot of special in
838,19,4,All Singers,Boogers and cum.

840,19,4,Lead Singer,How 'bout some feces with your flounder?
841,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
842,19,4,Lead Singer,You like that queefy quarter pounder?
843,19,4,Diner 4,What's that spice that feels tangy on my tongue?
844,19,4,Backup Singers,Oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo
845,19,4,Waiter 2,Oh that's a yuzu pepper [to himself] along with some boogers and cum
846,19,4,David,"Here you are, sir."
847,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Why thank you, David. That's good service."
848,19,4,David,"I will bring you food every day, my friend."
849,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Mmmm, is that a jalapeo cream sauce?"
850,19,4,David,Yes. My father made it just for youuu.
851,19,4,Eric Cartman,"Hmmm. It's tart, but savory."
852,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
853,19,4,Lead Singer,Bein' a food critic's easy!
854,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
855,19,4,Lead Singer,"Oh, you feel a little queasy?"
856,19,4,Lead Singer,Do you need a diagnosis? Well doctor's got one.
857,19,4,Backup Singers,Oooo-oooo-oooo-oooo
858,19,4,Dr Doctor,Your stomach seems to be filled with boogers and cum.
859,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
860,19,4,Lead Singer,Piss in your potatoes.
861,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum.
862,19,4,Lead Singer,"Some guy shit on your tomatoes.
Alright, fancy food critic, looks like you've won.
Now please enjoy all the boohoohoogers.
Boohoohoohoohoohoogers.
Aaannnddd.
Cuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmm!"
863,19,4,Backup Singers,Boogers and cum!
864,19,5,PC Principal,So these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed?
865,19,5,Eric Cartman,"[voice shaking terribly] Yes, I was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said I was fat."
866,19,5,PC Principal,"Alright, why don't you take me back to what happened?"
867,19,5,Eric Cartman,"I was in the locker room. I was in my underwear and these kids walked by [Craig and Clyde appear around the corner] Then I looked in the mirror and I thought I looked kind of ripped, and so I asked one of the kids [Clyde] if he would take a picture of me [holding two dumbbells, one in each hand] and he did. And I looked at the picture and I looked pretty ripped, so later at home, I put the picture up on my Yelp account and I typed in ""Don't I look ripped?"" and I thought people would be stoked on me. Then this morning I saw the comments on Twitter and some people called me names and said I wasn't ripped, and they said that I was fat and I didn't have muscles. The Internet made fun of me and [is overcome with emotion and hyperventilates. PC Principal sniffs and clears his throat.]"
868,19,5,Mr Mackey,"Well, Eric, maybe you shouldn't have put a picture of you in your underwear up on social media."
869,19,5,PC Principal,[jumps up and faces Mr. Mackey] Hey! You got a fuckin' problem Mackey!
870,19,5,Mr Mackey,"N-No, PC Principal."
871,19,5,PC Principal,"Because body-shaming is fuckin' serious, and I'm not gonna allow that shit in my school! [faces Cartman] Nobody should have to feel that kind of shame!"
872,19,5,Cashier,"Okay. sir, looks like your total is $37.83."
873,19,5,Randy Marsh,[pulls out his wallet and takes out $40] Alright.
874,19,5,Cashier,"[checks the monitor] Okay, and, would you like to add a dollar donation to help hungry kids around the world?"
875,19,5,Randy Marsh,"[real quiet] Oh uh, no, that, that's okay."
876,19,5,Cashier,Sorry?
877,19,5,Randy Marsh,"[real quiet] I'm, I'm good."
878,19,5,Cashier,"[having trouble hearing him clearly] I'm sorry, you don't want to give the dollar to hungry kids?"
879,19,5,Randy Marsh,"[real quiet] Not today, thank you."
880,19,5,Cashier,"Okay, no problem. [punches in the last few numbers into the register.] A window's gonna come up and ask if you're helping the hungry kids, just hit ""No, I'm not."""
881,19,5,Randy Marsh,"[real quiet] Oh, come on."
882,19,5,Cashier,"Try hitting it again. It's the box below the one that says, ""Sure, I'd love to help however I can."" [Randy hits the button again... and again a few more times, but it only beeps twice. The cashier looks at it.] Ah, darn thing. Sorry. Most people give the dollar. I can do this manually. [turns to the register and taps a few keys]"
883,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Look, I give money to charity a lot, okay?"
884,19,5,Cashier,"Oh, sure you do."
885,19,5,Randy Marsh,I do. I just don't want to every time I shop for food.
886,19,5,Cashier,"That's completely understandable. [reads something] ""Have customer speak on the-"" Oh-okay. if you can just speak into the voice decoder and say ""I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids."""
887,19,5,Randy Marsh,"[leans in and speaks into the ""decoder""] I'm not giving anything to the hungry kids. [his voice echoes throughout the store, and everyone takes notice]"
888,19,5,Cashier,"Okay, that's got it. So with the ice cream, the vodka, pizza pockets, and nothing for hungry kids, that's $37.83. [getting a bit sarcastic] Oh, don't forget your change."
889,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Look, if I give money every time I went grocery-shopping, I would be-!"
890,19,5,Cashier,"[cuts him off] Thanks for shopping, sir. Next, please."
891,19,5,Randy Marsh,[takes his paper bag full of groceries and leaves] Dick!
892,19,5,PC Principal,"Morning, Kyle. Have a seat right there. [Kyle takes the seat next to Cartman and is instantly displeased] You probably heard that Eric here has been dealing with some body shaming? [Cartman is still whimpering]"
893,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,Uh huh.
894,19,5,PC Principal,"Well Eric and I have been talking, and we've decided it's probably best for him to get off of social media."
895,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah probably.
896,19,5,PC Principal,So what we're looking for is a student volunteer. Somebody who can put the things Eric wants up on the Internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more of a safe space for him.
897,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait, what?"
898,19,5,Eric Cartman,I said you were perfect because you're really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time [gathers his thoughts] so you'd probably do a really good job.
899,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,You want me to run Cartman's Twitter and Yelp account and only give him the good comments?
900,19,5,PC Principal,That's right.
901,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,No.
902,19,5,PC Principal,"Kyle, you know what body-shaming is, right? How much it can hurt someone's life? All you have to do is check out all the comments, type out just the positive ones, and give that to Eric on paper."
903,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,"If he doesn't like what people say on Twitter, he can get off. [Cartman begins to cry]"
904,19,5,PC Principal,"Okay Kyle, well maybe you'd like two weeks' detention instead."
905,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[a bit stunned, considers his options] Give me... give me detention."
906,19,5,PC Principal,You sure about that?
907,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I'll take the detention."
908,19,5,PC Principal,"That's two weeks' detention for you, bud! I'll see you at 4! [Kyle looks at Eric, gets up, and leaves. Next, PC Principal is talking to another student] And when we said someone should probably help Eric by filtering out any negative comments, he mentioned you by name."
909,19,5,Wendy Testaburger,Is this a joke?
910,19,5,Eric Cartman,I'm not a joke!
911,19,5,PC Principal,"Nothing funny about this, Testaburger! This is a big problem in our country!"
912,19,5,Wendy Testaburger,I'm not doing it.
913,19,5,PC Principal,"And that's two weeks' detention for you! Congratulations! [Wendy looks at Eric, gets up, and leaves. Next, PC Principal is talking to another student] So, any comments that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way, you need to delete and not include in your daily report to Eric. [Butters is shown next to Cartman now]"
914,19,5,Eric Cartman,I wanted someone smart and hard-working!
915,19,5,Butters Stotch,Do I gotta?
916,19,5,PC Principal,You want detention?
917,19,5,Butters Stotch,"Well if I get detention, uh I'll get grounded."
918,19,5,PC Principal,"Then you start today! Butters, it's your job to make sure Eric has a safe space."
919,19,5,Female Shopper,"Oh ahhh, I'm sorry."
920,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Oh no, my, my fault."
921,19,5,Female Shopper,Isn't it great having a Whole Foods?
922,19,5,Randy Marsh,"This is where I come for lunch every day. Gotta eat healthy to stay fit. [pleased at this encounter. He turns to leave and sees the cashier from before, who waves back at him. To himself] Aw, shit, it's that guy. [as no one else is waiting, he goes ahead and makes his purchases]"
923,19,5,Cashier,"Aand how are you today, sir?"
924,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Great. [leans in and in a low voice] Uh, listen, before you ring me up, I just wanna let you know I'm not gonna be giving extra money to charity, so can we, can we just skip that part?"
925,19,5,Cashier,"Oh no problem sir, they've updated the system so it's a lot more streamlined now. Find everything you need today?"
926,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, thanks."
927,19,5,Cashier,"There we go, and that's... Okay, and would you like to give a dollar to hungry kids today?"
928,19,5,Randy Marsh,"[softly] No. I said no, before."
929,19,5,Cashier,"Oh that's right. Okay, there's a picture of a little hungry boy. Will you just press on his belly? [Randy does so, and hears ""Oww, owww."" The cashier checks the readout] Okay, that's got it. So, with the no help for hungry kids that's $18.87. [Randy hands him a $20 bill] Out of 20. [the cashier gives him some change back in the coin return tray] Your change is right there, just pull the sandwich out of the little girl's mouth. [a cardboard cutout of a little girl hides the coin return]"
930,19,5,Randy Marsh,This is not streamlined!
931,19,5,Cashier,"It's just the  new change dispenser, sir. [Randy then goes ahead and tries to pull the sandwich away]"
932,19,5,Randy Marsh,[a couple of grunts later] I can't.
933,19,5,Cashier,"Yes, she's a hungry one. You've gotta pull hard."
934,19,5,Randy Marsh,Dammit! The sandwich isn't coming out.
935,19,5,Cashier,"Try putting your foot on her face. [Randy promptly does this. He also notices the woman he bumped into earlier in Checkout 4 and flashes a smile to her. Finally he pulls the sandwich out of the cutout's mouth and gets his change and his groceries] Have a nice day, sir!"
936,19,5,Randy Marsh,I was having a nice day! [leaves the store]
937,19,5,Butters Stotch,"[sounding quite tired] Eric, hold up."
938,19,5,Eric Cartman,There you are. You have my social media comments?
939,19,5,Butters Stotch,"Yeah. Yeah, right here. [hands him the papers] I just finished this morning."
940,19,5,Eric Cartman,"[reviews them] Mm-hm. Hm-oh, that's nice. Oh great. This is all the Twitter comments?"
941,19,5,Butters Stotch,Yeah. And the people commenting on your Yelp page starts here. [points to the first comment on the current page]
942,19,5,Eric Cartman,"Okay, nice. Oh ni- oh, very enthusiastic. This is so great! [turns around and walks by Kyle, who's at his locker.] Oh Kyle! You thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid? You should see all the comments I'm getting. People are actually really stoked on me now."
943,19,5,Butters Stotch,It's a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness.
944,19,5,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. In order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming, we have a- [points to someone on the bleachers] HEY LESLIE! PUT A FUCKIN' SOCK IN IT! [Leslie was whispering to Esther again, and again she backs off slowly] We have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty. [steps towards a screen upon which is a graphic that says ""NO MORE FAT SHAMING""] So please welcome action star and hero, Steven Seagal. [claps a few times, then puts the mic into a mic stand and steps aside as music plays. Pics of Seagal pop up as a slide show]"
945,19,5,Steven Seagal,"[voice-over] You've got a problem with me? I'm your worse nightmare. I have no fear of death, more important, I don't fear life. [gun shot sound effect. The slide show ends and an obese Seagal walks into the gym with a gun drawn. He gets to the mic and begins to whimper, and lowers the gun] I'm a big action movie star and people are pretty stoked on me. And then I put a picture of myself up on the Internet and I had my shirt off and I said ""Do you think I'm ripped?"" and some people commented saying I didn't look ripped, that I was fat, and they called me Steven Se-boom-boom, so I put another picture on the Internet and I thought people would be stoked on me, but they said that I looked like a fat turd, and they said I wasn't buff. [hyperventilates] Body-shaming isn't cool, and, if p-people shame you on the Inter n-net, you have to make sure that you stay, you stay strong and tell everyone you're proud of how you look, like this. [begins to dance as ""Got To Be Real"" starts playing]"
946,19,5,PC Principal,"Hey, Seagal! Listen, that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids."
947,19,5,Steven Seagal,[sniffs] Thank you.
948,19,5,PC Principal,"I can see that you're in a lot of pain, bro. I've got someone who I think can help. [at the office a few minutes later, with Seagal and Butters. He talks to Butters] So I want you to do for Mr. Seagal the same thing that you're doing for Eric Cartman."
949,19,5,Butters Stotch,"But PC Principal, I really don't have time."
950,19,5,PC Principal,This man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness! I think you can give him a little of your time!
951,19,5,Butters Stotch,Yes sir...
952,19,5,Cashier,Find everything you needed today?
953,19,5,Randy Marsh,Yes.
954,19,5,Cashier,"Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98. Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?"
955,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Yes, I would like to give a dollar."
956,19,5,Cashier,[suprised] You want to give a dollar?
957,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Yes, I will."
958,19,5,Cashier,"[excited sounding] Oh wow, okay! So that's $10 for the beer, $4.20 in chocolate-covered peanuts, $26 in filet mignons, [sarcastically] and one dollar for hungry kids around the world. On ""amount of donation"" it will say $10, $20, or $50, can you just press the ""$1"" box? [Randy does so and bells, sirens, and colored lights go off. The cashier gets on the mic and says] Attention shoppers, somebody just joined the $1 club, giving one whole dollar to help feed hungry children. [quickly goes around the checkout] Here's your T-shirt! [quickly slips it on Randy and takes a picture, then prints the picture. The shirt says ""I Gave $1.00 to End Hunger."" The cashier pins the picture on the ""$1"" cork board, which was empty before] Ho, won't the kids be thrilled when they get their piece of that big impressive dollar. [walks back to his register and sings] For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a holly good fellow, for he's a holly good fellow! He ended world hunger. [Randy takes his groceries and leaves, whimpering]"
959,19,5,Butters Stotch,Yech. Oh God that's terrible. Jesus.
960,19,5,Demi Lovato,"[sitting on Butters' bed] Yeah. No, I'm telling you, Tracy, it's the greatest thing ever. I'm getting all my Twitter and Instagram comments on paper, and the nasty mean stuff, all gets edited out."
961,19,5,Butters Stotch,Whoa my God. Wugh.
962,19,5,Demi Lovato,"Yeah. And the coolest thing? Ever since I started using this service, all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me. So cool, right?"
963,19,5,Eric Cartman,Butters!
964,19,5,Butters Stotch,[startled] Yeah!
965,19,5,Eric Cartman,"[at the bedroom door] What the hell is this? The last report you gave me has a comment that says ""This picture of you burned my eyes, fatso!"""
966,19,5,Butters Stotch,"Well I'm sorry, Eric. I, I guess it slipped through the cracks. I'm overloaded with all the new people."
967,19,5,Eric Cartman,What new people? [walks up to the computer]
968,19,5,Butters Stotch,"Well I've got Demi Lovato [points to her] to take care of now, and Lena Dunham just put a picture of her asshole on Twitter, and wants only the positive comments."
969,19,5,Eric Cartman,"Dude, fuck Demi Lovato! She's fuckin' hot, she's not being fat-shamed!"
970,19,5,Demi Lovato,[stands up] Am so! But I don't care. People just have to accept my body the way it is.
971,19,5,Eric Cartman,"Butters, I want this fixed by tonight, you got that!"
972,19,5,Butters Stotch,"Okay, Eric. [Cartman walks away]"
973,19,5,Randy Marsh,"This is a place where hope is scarce. These people are hungry. Little Jojo here might not eat today. But does that mean it's okay for cashiers to ask us for money while we're in the checkout line? It isn't right, and it isn't fair. Just $2 a day adds up to 62 goddamned dollars a month if you go to Whole Foods as much as I do. Nobody should have to feel the shame, the humiliation, of being asked to add money onto their grocery bill. Help now. Let's make grocery stores a #SAFESPACE for all. Together, we can make a difference."
974,19,5,Poor Girl,Because charity-shaming hurts everyone. [Randy holds her a bit closer]
975,19,5,PC Principal,"You know, if there's one thing I really respect, it's plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful. These ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie, and we wanna make sure they're protected from any harassing comments."
976,19,5,Butters Stotch,"[Butters is seated across from PC Principal with an entire row of plus-sized women in lingerie] Do I have to, sir?"
977,19,5,PC Principal,"Hey, they're gonna putting themselves out there, and all I'm asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean."
978,19,5,Butters Stotch,"PC Principal, ah I don't think you quite realize how much negative stuff I have to sift through."
979,19,5,PC Principal,"I know it's a lot, but I just really need you to help these plus-sized models. And Vin Diesel."
980,19,5,Butters Stotch,Vin Diesel too??
981,19,5,PC Principal,"Look bro! You've done an amazing job with Eric Cartman. You have really turned his life around, and other people deserve... to be as happy as he is."
982,19,5,Eric Cartman,Everyone likes me and thinks I'm great in my safe spaaaace.
983,19,5,Steven Seagal,My safe spaaaace.
984,19,5,Eric Cartman,"[eating in a restaurant, Butters hands him more comments] People don't judge me and haters don't hate in my safe spaaaace. [Butters is hard at work]"
985,19,5,PC Principal,Your safe spaaaace.
986,19,5,Cartman and Seagal,"Bully-proof windows, troll-safe doors, nothing but kindness and healing."
987,19,5,Randy Marsh,"You might call me a pussy, but I won't hear you in my safe spaaaace."
988,19,5,Steven Seagal,My safe spaaaace.
989,19,5,Eric Cartman,Bully-proof windows.
990,19,5,Demi Lovato,"If you do not like me, you are not allowed in my safe spaaaace."
991,19,5,Plus sized models,My safe spaaaace
992,19,5,PC Principal,[to Vin Diesel] Look and you will see there's a very select crowd in your safe spaaaace. [Steven Seagal is resting on a bed in his safe space]
993,19,5,All,My safe spaaaace.
994,19,5,Eric Cartman,People that support me.
995,19,5,All,Mixed in with
996,19,5,Eric Cartman,More people that support me.
997,19,5,All,"And say nice things. Rainbows all around me, there is no shame in my safe spaaaace."
998,19,5,Randy Marsh,My safe spaaaace.
999,19,5,Eric Cartman,Bully-proof windows. [a change in tempo and a masked villain enters the video.]
1000,19,5,Reality,"I am going to tear down your safe space! Brick by brick, I shall smash it with glee!"
1001,19,5,Eric Cartman,What? Who is that?
1002,19,5,Reality,"You cannot stop me from getting inside! I am cold and I am hard, and my name... is Reality."
1003,19,5,Demi Lovato,"Oh no, not reality! Somebody stop him!"
1004,19,5,Eric Cartman,"I'll take care of him, Demi! [shoots lightning from his hands, and the various people in their safe spaces are now dressed to dance!]"
1005,19,5,All,"You can't ruin our lives, Reality!"
1006,19,5,Eric Cartman,Our safe spaces will keep you out!
1007,19,5,Reality,Drat!
1008,19,5,All,We can face almost anything!
1009,19,5,Eric Cartman,But Reality we can do without!
1010,19,5,Reality,Nooooo... [vanishes]
1011,19,5,Eric Cartman,Bully-proof windows.
1012,19,5,All,Troll-safe doors. [slowing down] My Safe Spaaaaaaaace! [all stop]
1013,19,5,Eric Cartman,That was nice.
1014,19,5,Cashier,"All right, thanks, have a great day. [Randy steps up] Good afternoon sir."
1015,19,5,Randy Marsh,"[self-assured] Oh, hello. You might know Steven Seagal [who steps up, with his gun aimed at the cashier]"
1016,19,5,Steven Seagal,You wanna play with me?
1017,19,5,Randy Marsh,And this is Vin Diesel.
1018,19,5,Cashier,"Oh, hello gentlemen."
1019,19,5,Randy Marsh,It'd be... a really bad idea for you to charity-shame me today. These guys are here to protect my safe space.
1020,19,5,Cashier,"That's great. [hums to himself] This little piggy went to market. This little piggy stayed home. This little piggy was in Fast And The Furious, [Vin Diesel begins to whimper and walks away] and this little piggy goes direct to cable. [Steven Seagal begins to whimper and walks away. The cashier jabs Randy in the belly] And this little piggy just bought fifty-three dollars in beer and frozen pizzas. Would you like to make a dollar donation to hungry kids today?"
1021,19,5,Demi Lovato,"Look around you. What do you see? People who are slim. Skinny. But not everyone can have nice bodies like them. Just imagine it. Putting your pictures up on Twitter just to have some people write comments about your weight. It happens, all too often."
1022,19,5,Randy Marsh,[taking over] But it doesn't stop there. People also can be shamed for other traits viewed as negative. Mike here was shamed for not being a good recycler.
1023,19,5,Demi Lovato,"And so together, we have created #shamelessAmerica, [a screen pops up with ""let's work towards a #shamelessAmerica.""] so no one is ever labeled..."
1024,19,5,Fat Woman,Tubby.
1025,19,5,Man with Cap,Bad with tools.
1026,19,5,Woman 2,Dyke!
1027,19,5,Man 2,Butter butter dirty line cutter.
1028,19,5,Randy Marsh,Let's work together to create a completely shameless America.
1029,19,5,Poor Boy,[emaciated] Because shaming hurts everyone. [Randy holds him a bit closer]
1030,19,5,Butters Stotch,"[reading through online messages] ""Hey Demi Lovato, I bet your vagina has a-"" [begins to gag] oh. Oh God. Oh, that's horrible [picks up a waste basket and vomits into it] Augh. [coughs] Jeez. Delete. Delete that too. [continues reading comments aloud] ""I'd like to stick my wiener into those fat rolls of-"" Oh God! [Reality sneaks into his room] Uh, delete! ""You aren't fat, but my dick is-"" Whoa, God."
1031,19,5,Reality,HaHAA!
1032,19,5,Butters Stotch,GAAAHHH!
1033,19,5,Reality,"So you're the one trying to destroy me, eh??"
1034,19,5,Butters Stotch,"What? [falls out of his chair. Reality tries to grab him, but misses. Butters runs to a night stand]"
1035,19,5,Reality,"You little shit! Keep me out, will you?"
1036,19,5,Butters Stotch,"I don't know you, sir!"
1037,19,5,Reality,"You can't stop me! [tries to grab Butters again, but breaks the lamp on the night stand] I'm going to kill you! [jumps up to fall on him. At that moment, the bedroom door opens]"
1038,19,5,Stephen Stotch,Butters! What are you doing!
1039,19,5,Butters Stotch,"[panicked] Well-ll the man! Uh, the man is gonna get me! [Butters points to where Reality was standing only for the shot to widen showing he is no longer there]"
1040,19,5,Cashier,And some chocolate-covered almonds. Vanderpump Sangria mix.
1041,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, um, I'm a little tired because I'm actually hosting a huge fundraiser for my charity organization [shows off his shirt: ""#ShamelessAmerica""] that I'm sort of the head of."
1042,19,5,Cashier,"That's great, sir. Ice cream sandwiches."
1043,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, we're gonna raise a lot of money. Celebrities are coming. Demi Lovato is givin' a hundred thousand for the event."
1044,19,5,Cashier,"Wonderful. Rotisserie chicken. Oh yep, gotta have that Frank's hot sauce."
1045,19,5,Randy Marsh,"I just thought, you know, a fundraiser dinner was sort of the appropriate place to ask for donations."
1046,19,5,Cashier,"That's great, sir. Okay, your total is $37.85, and would you like to give a dollar to help put a hamster through college?"
1047,19,5,Randy Marsh,[stunned] ...What? Did you not hear anything I said? I'm - I'm doin' all this stuff.
1048,19,5,Cashier,"Not a problem, sir. [takes out a hamster from behind the counter] If you could just press the N0 button and tell the little hamster he's not going to college. Just look him right in the eye, sir, and say ""Not today, buddy."""
1049,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Actually, my big fundraising gala is helping put hamsters through college too."
1050,19,5,Cashier,"[Excited] Oh, really? Wow. Did you hear that, Banjo? You've got support. [puts the hamster back behind the counter] Well, you have a nice day sir. [hands Randy his receipt] And thank so much for being so generous."
1051,19,5,Randy Marsh,"You're welcome. [takes his groceries, but has no bag to put them in. He doesn't mind]"
1052,19,5,Eric Cartman,Hey Kyle. You wanna see what people said about my dick pic? Everyone's pretty stoked on it.
1053,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,There's more than two people on the Internet.
1054,19,5,Butters Stotch,The man! The man the man the man the man! [runs around the corner completely naked] The man he's gonna get me! He shadows me everywhere! [stops another student and gets in his face] Do you see the man?!
1055,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns him around] Butters, what are you doing?! [the other student leaves]"
1056,19,5,Butters Stotch,Well he's gonna get me!
1057,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, Butters, you're seeing things! Sifting through all the horrible stuff people say on the Internet is making you lose it!"
1058,19,5,Butters Stotch,[breaks free and runs off] The world is darkness! The man is coming!
1059,19,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Butters! [he and Kyle give chase. Butters goes up a flight of stairs]"
1060,19,5,Butters Stotch,Aaaaa! Aaaaa!
1061,19,5,Kindergarten Teacher,And what color is the little ball the kittens are playing with?
1062,19,5,Butters Stotch,"[runs into the classroom] Run for your lives, you little fuckers, the man is coming! [the kids scream as Kyle enters the room. Stan, Davd and Kenny follow him in]"
1063,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, listen to my voice."
1064,19,5,Butters Stotch,The man is gonna get me if I don't stop!
1065,19,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Then stop, dude! Butters, all this isn't worth it. Just. Take, the detention, dude."
1066,19,5,Butters Stotch,[thinks a moment and jumps through a glass window on the second floor] YEEAAAAAGGHH! [hits the snow hard]
1067,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Alright everyone, thanks for coming to help raise money to stop shaming, and put hamsters through college."
1068,19,5,Guest,What'd he say?
1069,19,5,Randy Marsh,"And now, a woman who knows about shaming firsthand, supermodel Gigi Hadid."
1070,19,5,Gigi Hadid,"Alright, everyone enjoying themselves? How's that filet mignon? [approving comments all around] You know, we're all here for a really important reason. Because everyone should-"
1071,19,5,Stephen Stotch,"Randy, Randy, we've got a problem."
1072,19,5,Randy Marsh,What?
1073,19,5,Stephen Stotch,Reality's here. He's trying to crash the party.
1074,19,5,Randy Marsh,Reality? Who let him in? Shit! [leaves to face him]
1075,19,5,Reality,"[making a nuisance of himself at a table, spills a glass of wine] Woo, nice wine, huh? What do you think of that? [tips another glass over] You know what I think of your pretty flowers? [grabs the centerpiece bouquet and throws it to the ground, then dumps a guest's dinner on his lap] There you go. How do you like that? [Randy and Stephen arrive]"
1076,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Alright buddy, let's go."
1077,19,5,Reality,I shit on all of you!
1078,19,5,Randy Marsh,Seagal?! [Steven Seagal approaches with gun drawn and aimed at Reality]
1079,19,5,Reality,"[to Seagal, Randy, and three guests] Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you! [jumps over the table and rushes the stage, then grabs the mic from Gigi Hadid] Give me that, you stupid bitch! [she walks off] What a lovely charity event. I suppose you're all feeling pretty good about yourselves, hm? What have you done? You've raised $300 by spending half a million on filet mignon and crystal glasses. [crowd is silenced and ashamed at themselves] Look at you, Vin Dipshit. You think fat-shaming is wrong, so in response you show off your abs. You're the one fat-shaming, idiot! What's the matter with you people?! You're saaad that people are meeean? Well I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal arts college campus! We eat too much; we take our spoiled lives for granted, feel a little bad about it sometimes! No, you wanna put up all your shit on the Internet and have every single person say ""Hooray for you!"" Fuck you. You're all pricks. And I've got news for you! While you've all been sitting here trying to feel good, the little boy who sucked all your shit is about to die from it!"
1080,19,5,Steven Seagal,What?
1081,19,5,Demi Lovato,Oh my God. What have we done?
1082,19,5,Steven Seagal,"Jesus, I d-I didn't even think."
1083,19,5,PC Principal,I guess... I asked too much of one kid.
1084,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Listen, everybody. [the group splits in two so the camera can see him] I think there's a way to try and make this right for everyone."
1085,19,5,Randy Marsh,"To date, Shameless America has raised over $40,000. With that money, we are putting more and more iPads into these people's hands. [all the kids look at the iPads, not sure what to do with them] With iPads, these people can finally help more Americans get rid of negativity on their social media. [Jojo returns with an iPad, handing it to Randy] Oh, thanks Jojo. I'm shame-free now, and you can be too. For just $1 a day, one of these beautiful children will protect you from trolls and make your Internet a safe space. [a screen pops up with ""We won't rest until America is #completelyshameless""]We won't rest until America is completely shameless. The world can be brutal, but Shameless America is going to continue to take steps to make sure everyone has a safe space... forever."
1086,19,5,Butters Stotch,Are you sure this is a good idea?
1087,19,5,Randy Marsh,"Uh huh. [Butters pulls the lever and the trap door opens underneath Reality, making him drop and hang. After some choking, Reality dies and the crowd erupts in cheers]"
1088,19,6,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. [Wendy reads through some cue cards at the podium] Today we're going to be showing you some art from our Asian-American students-DAMMIT LESLIE, SHUT YOUR FUCKING PIE-HOLE! [Leslie is shown, but she's confused, as she's not talking to anyone.] from our Asian-American students presented by our student-body president, Wendy Testaburger."
1089,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey guys. As you know, we have several new students here at South Park Elementary. We have been getting to know some of the Asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called ""yaoi."" [A picture on a slideshow showing the English and Japanese spellings of the word, and Oriental music plays.] Yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty involving two people whose love is looked down upon. The art tries to show that all love is magical, like in Lisa Akimoto's piece, ""Tweek and Craig - Forbidden Love."" [Tweek and Craig in a French kiss.]"
1090,19,6,Asian Student Girls,Awwww.
1091,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What?
1092,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"Kelly Zhou goes a bit more whimsical with ""Craig and Tweek: Moonlight Dance."" [Tweek wears a pink bow in his hair and is wrapped in a pink ribbon while Craig stands behind him looking down at his face.]"
1093,19,6,Asian Student Girls,Awwww.
1094,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Dude, what the fuck?"
1095,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"In yaoi art, the seme, or top, is usually dominating the uke, or bottom, as demonstrated in Heather Nishimura's ""Boizu Rabu."" [Craig reaching down into Tweek's briefs as Tweek reaches up to stroke Craig's head]"
1096,19,6,Asian Student Girls,Awwww. [Stan and Kyle look at each other]
1097,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,But yaoi can branch out to other things as well.
1098,19,6,Eric Cartman,Uh oh.
1099,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"As we see here in ""Lily, Frog, Tweek and Craig."" [Tweek is on his back with Craig on top of him pinning him down while looking into his eyes.]"
1100,19,6,Stan Marsh,"I just don't get it. I mean, Tweek and Craig aren't gay. Right?"
1101,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[questioning, seeking confirmation] No. We would know."
1102,19,6,Butters Stotch,"Well, but then why would Asian girls draw them like that?"
1103,19,6,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, what is this yaoi thing all about? I am so c-c-c-confused."
1104,19,6,Stan Marsh,And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig... could it happen to any of us?
1105,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Uhh, excuse me, why are you doing this?? [holds up a picture of himself pushing Tweek on a swing, and Tweek enjoying it]"
1106,19,6,Girl 1,"""Oh, hi, Craig. ?? ?? ?? ???. (He's wearing a different shirt today.) [looks at the girl on her right and addresses her] ?? ?? ??? ??? (how do you know what's underneath his jacket?) [The girl replies.]"
1107,19,6,Craig Tucker,What? Well what did she say?
1108,19,6,Girl 3,"I don't know, that was Korean. I'm Japanese."
1109,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"[Over caffeinated] What is going on, huh? Huh? Me and him aren't together. Why is this happening?!"
1110,19,6,Girl 1,"[girl 1 addresses the girl to her left] ?? ??? ?? ???? ???"". [(Craig should be along with Tweek.)]"
1111,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Everyone thinks I'm gay! What if my parents find out! Huh!
1112,19,6,PC Principal,"Alright guys, I know there have been a lot of rumors flyin' around. Just wanted to check in, see if you have any questions for me."
1113,19,6,Craig Tucker,Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay?
1114,19,6,PC Principal,What's wrong with being gay? Nothin' wrong with that.
1115,19,6,Craig Tucker,But we aren't! I'm not!
1116,19,6,Tweek Tweak,I'm not either!
1117,19,6,PC Principal,"That is completely irrelevant! Okay? What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, is that you understand affirmative consent."
1118,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What's that?
1119,19,6,PC Principal,"IF there is a romantic relationship here, you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration."
1120,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Gah!
1121,19,6,PC Principal,"Now, in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier, but you still have to follow some guidelines, alright?"
1122,19,6,Craig Tucker,But I'm not gay!
1123,19,6,PC Principal,"I don't care about that, bro! Tweek, if, and I'm only saying if, at some point you wanted to touch Craig's penis, you can't just go grabbin' for it. Alright? You need to say something like ""Craig, is it alright with you if I touch your penis?"" Okay? Let's try it out."
1124,19,6,Tweek Tweak,NO!
1125,19,6,PC Principal,You want two weeks' detention instead?! This shit's important!
1126,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Craig, can I touch your penis?"
1127,19,6,PC Principal,"Okay, good. Now Craig, you might say ""You may touch my penis. I'm comfortable with that."" [Craig isn't happy with that line and waits for more] Or of course, you could say ""No, you may not touch my penis at this time."""
1128,19,6,Craig Tucker,No you may not!
1129,19,6,PC Principal,"Okay. Now we're getting somewhere. Now Craig, what would you say if you wanted to take a gander at Tweek's asshole?"
1130,19,6,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, you should have a talk with Stan."
1131,19,6,Randy Marsh,For what?
1132,19,6,Sharon Marsh,"I guess something happened at school today involving two of Stan's friends,.. being gay?"
1133,19,6,Randy Marsh,What?
1134,19,6,Sharon Marsh,Yeah. Stan seems really perplexed.
1135,19,6,Randy Marsh,Wow. Our town has only had a Whole Foods for three weeks and we already have our first gay kids. So cool. [smiles to himself]
1136,19,6,Sharon Marsh,"Go talk to him, Randy, and be delicate."
1137,19,6,Randy Marsh,Hey bud. How's it hangin'? [sits on the bed next to Stan]
1138,19,6,Stan Marsh,"I'm confused, Dad. There was this thing at school."
1139,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Well, guess what? You've got a really progressive PC dad who knows all about this stuff, okay? Go ahead, ask me anything."
1140,19,6,Stan Marsh,I just don't understand how it's decided.
1141,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Ah, well, you see, it's a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences."
1142,19,6,Stan Marsh,"No, I mean like, what makes the Asians decide who they're gonna make gay?"
1143,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[confused] The Asians? The Asians decide who's going to be gay? [feigns knowing, playing it off] Uh are y-, yeah, yeah they do. Uh, the Asians just, you know, the Asians pick who they pick, and um, it's al- it's, the way it's always been."
1144,19,6,Stan Marsh,So you've heard of yaoi?
1145,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[embarrassed, playing it off] Yeah, of course. Yaoi, anal intercourse, Maui Zaui, I, I know all this stuff, Stan."
1146,19,6,Gerald Broflovski,"Oh hey, Thomas! Hey, we heard about Craig. We think it's just terrific."
1147,19,6,Thomas Tucker,[turns around] What about Craig? [Stephen Stotch comes up behind him]
1148,19,6,Stephen Stotch,"Thomas! I'm so glad that Craig is finally happy. [aloud to the other shoppers] Hey, it's Craig's dad, everybody. [shoppers around the store clap]"
1149,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Tweek's out of coffee, honey."
1150,19,6,Mrs Tweek,"Oh, here you go, kiddo. [fills Tweek's cup]"
1151,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Tweek, is there anything you want to talk to us about?"
1152,19,6,Tweek Tweak,No.
1153,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"[slowly] Well, we heard that you're gay. And I want you to know we've never been so proud of you."
1154,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Oh God. [lets his head hit the table, smashing into all of his food]"
1155,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"We thought you were just a spaz, but to know that you've got so much going on inside."
1156,19,6,Mom,"We're so proud of you, Tweek."
1157,19,6,Tweek Tweak,AAaaagh!
1158,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Knowing what I know now, I'm gonna be a much better dad to you. In fact, I just, I just want to give you some money, Tweek. [pulls out his wallet and then some bills] Can I give you some money? [Tweek looks up with mashed potatoes covering parts of his face] Here, I I love you so much, son. [hands Tweek the bills]"
1159,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[thinking] Dude, Tweek and Craig. It's just so weird. If they've been gay this whole time, have they been checking me out? I'm pretty sure Craig has seen my wiener. Should I kick his ass?"
1160,19,6,Cupid Me,[flits in out of nowhere] Aw come on. What's wrong with two guys liking each other?
1161,19,6,Eric Cartman,"I just don't understand it, Cupid Me. Wanting to like, kiss a dude?"
1162,19,6,Cupid Me,"But if love is love, then it takes form in all shapes and sizes. Teehee."
1163,19,6,Eric Cartman,"I guess, just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I shouldn't support it. Alright. Maybe you can help them along."
1164,19,6,Cupid Me,Really? Can I?
1165,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Yes, Cupid Me. Make it quick, and don't let anyone see you."
1166,19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh thank you! I won't! [floats out and away, giggling all the while.]"
1167,19,6,Cupid Me,You just need a little spark of magic. [shoots an arrow into Craig's head.] And now I'm gonna pee in your mouth. [does so and giggles] Love is in the air. [squeezes a last bit of pee out]
1168,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Did you do it, Cupid-Me?"
1169,19,6,Cupid Me,"I hit him with my love arrow, and then I peed in his mouth just for fun."
1170,19,6,Eric Cartman,[laughs] That's awesome! [chuckles as Cupid-Me flits to his left side] That's so sweet.
1171,19,6,Cupid Me,I thought you might like that.
1172,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, dude. You're hilarious."
1173,19,6,Cupid Me,"And do you think I'm cute, too? 'Cause I think you're kind of cute."
1174,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[his smile vanishes] Stop that, Cupid Me. I told you I'm not homosexual, okay? It's not funny."
1175,19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh well, at least Tweek and Craig are in love now. [flits away]"
1176,19,6,Eric Cartman,Yep. School tomorrow should be really interesting.
1177,19,6,Stan Marsh,And so my dad talked to me about it.
1178,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah?
1179,19,6,Stan Marsh,"And my dad said that Asians have always done this, and they, like, do make people gay."
1180,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[runs up to them] You guys! You guys, hurry!"
1181,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1182,19,6,Eric Cartman,"It's, It's Tweek and Craig, dude! They're about to have sex! [runs off. Stan and Kyle follow.]"
1183,19,6,Craig Tucker,Got a fuckin' problem man?! [pushes Tweek back]
1184,19,6,Tweek Tweak,You're the one with the fuckin' problem! [pushes Craig back]
1185,19,6,Craig Tucker,I told you to stay a hundred yards from me!
1186,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"You'd better not fuckin' push me again, man!"
1187,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh-ho come on, you guys. Get a room. [Craig and Tweek start fighting. Soon Cartman grabs onto Kevin for support]"
1188,19,6,PC Principal,Hello Mr. Tucker. I need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today.
1189,19,6,Thomas Tucker,[at his office.] Craig? Craig got in a fight? [grins]
1190,19,6,PC Principal,"Yes, with his boyfriend. Just a lovers' quarrel, probably. [Craig and Tweek are seated opposite]"
1191,19,6,Craig Tucker,Goddammit!
1192,19,6,PC Principal,"Something to be expected in relationships. Apparently there were no affirmative consent issues, as your son knows the right way to play with another boy's penis."
1193,19,6,Thomas Tucker,Oh God...! [facepalm]
1194,19,6,PC Principal,"There's not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay. We wanna be supportive, so we're just gonna send them on home with some money, alright? Alright, you have a nice day."
1195,19,6,Thomas Tucker,Money?
1196,19,6,Xi Jinping,Wei? Ni hao [(Hello? Who is there?)]
1197,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[on the other end, in his study] Uh, hi, Mr. Jinping. Thanks for taking my call, I was... just wondering if you could shed some light on how your people decide who will be gay and who will be straight."
1198,19,6,Xi Jinping,What?
1199,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[sighs] I'm sorry, I-I don't speak Asian, but... um, oh uh, oh, y-yao, yaoi. Yaoi, yes? Boizu rabu. Huh, how does that work?"
1200,19,6,Xi Jinping,That-a come from-a Japan.
1201,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh, it's Japan that decides? [Stan walks into the study.] How the hell do they actually make people geh-? [notices Stan] Aaaa-a-ah, Japan. Of course, is who does the yaoi to make people gay."
1202,19,6,Xi Jinping,"They are dogs! [pounds his desk with his left fist] who refused, and not apologized, to the Chinese republic!"
1203,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Uh huh, yes, that of course I do already know about homosexuality."
1204,19,6,Delivery Man,"Hi, flower delivery for Eric Cartman? [Cartman hears this and looks over]"
1205,19,6,Liane Cartman,"Oh my, how beautiful. [signs for the flowers and takes them to Cartman] Oh look sweetie, someone sent you flowers."
1206,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[sets his phone down, takes the bouquet, and reads the attached note.] ""Can't we just try? Tee Hee."" Oh man."
1207,19,6,Liane Cartman,"Who are they from, hon?"
1208,19,6,Eric Cartman,Someone who needs a real talking to.
1209,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Look, it's flattering, okay? But it doesn't change the fact that there's nothing here for you to keep pursuing."
1210,19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheehee. Aw, come on, let's be like Tweek and Craig. Everyone thinks they're kewl."
1211,19,6,Eric Cartman,You are wasting your time. I'm not attracted to guys.
1212,19,6,Cupid Me,But I'm so attracted to you.
1213,19,6,Eric Cartman,"I realize that, but I'm sorry. I need you to stop bothering me. [the smile leaves Cupid Me's face. Cartman's voice gets quieter] This... is done. I'm just not a homosexual. [dejected, Cupid Me goes limp in mid-air.]"
1214,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Well, hello Craig. Honey, it's Craig."
1215,19,6,Mom,"Awww, hi Craig."
1216,19,6,Craig Tucker,Is Tweek home?
1217,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"He sure is. Come on in. [holds the door open for Craig. From his house, Randy gives Richard a thumbs up. Richard returns the gesture and closes the door, then joins Mrs. Tweek and Craig in the middle of the living room] Would you like to have some coffee, Craig?"
1218,19,6,Craig Tucker,"No thank you, I just want to see Tweek."
1219,19,6,Mom,Awww.
1220,19,6,Richard Tweak and Mrs. Tweak,"Tweek's just up in his room playing. You can go on up. [Craig starts going upstairs] Oh, uh, but keep the door open, alright? [Craig gets mad at the insinuation. Richard says to his wife] They're so gay."
1221,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Hey dude. [this makes Tweek spit out his coffee, and he gets off his chair]"
1222,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"No, no! What are you doing here? [keeps his distance]"
1223,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Tweek, calm down. We have to put a stop to this."
1224,19,6,Tweek Tweak,There's no stopping it! The whole world wants me to be something I'm not!
1225,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Me too, dude! But there's something we can do."
1226,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What??
1227,19,6,Craig Tucker,We have to come out and say we're gay.
1228,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What?! Are you insane?! The way everyone-!
1229,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Wait. Wait! Because if we're gay, we can break up. And if we break up, no more pictures! We just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the Asian girls."
1230,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Like acting? No man, that is way too much pressure! I'll fail-"
1231,19,6,Craig Tucker,"You can do it, Tweek! You're capable of more than you think."
1232,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Agh. I'm a terrible actor.
1233,19,6,Craig Tucker,"You just follow my lead, and try and make it believable, okay?"
1234,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Oh gah-okay. Oh God!
1235,19,6,Thomas Tucker,"What did I do wrong, huh? Everyone's so damned happy, but... but why did this have to happen to my son?! What did I do to make my son like this?"
1236,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Hey, hey, whoa, you didn't do anything."
1237,19,6,Thomas Tucker,Oh what? You know about this?
1238,19,6,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, let me handle this guys, I'm PC. Look Thomas, you need to understand that being gay isn't a decision. You know, a lot of people think that Asians decide who's gay and who's not. But it isn't all Asians, it's just specifically the Japanese, okay?"
1239,19,6,Thomas Tucker,What?
1240,19,6,Randy Marsh,"[turns around] Why do the Japanese make some people gay and others not? [turns around again] Well, it all goes back to World War II, and atrocities that happened in China called the Rape of Don King."
1241,19,6,Skeeter,"Hey, you sure know a lot about this."
1242,19,6,Randy Marsh,Yes I do.
1243,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,"No dude, I looked it up. Yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship."
1244,19,6,Stan Marsh,But why?
1245,19,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know. But the point is, there's nothing about it that means Tweek and Craig are actually gay, at all."
1246,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Hey Tweek! Hold up. Listen, it's just not going to work. [the smiles vanish]"
1247,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"What? Why not? [Stan, Kyle, Kenny, Davd, and Butters arrive]"
1248,19,6,Craig Tucker,"I'm sorry Tweek, but we can't lie to ourselves anymore. [turns to face the gathering crowd of kids] Yes, we are gay, but we do not belong together."
1249,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"We don't belong together? What suddenly changed, Craig?"
1250,19,6,Craig Tucker,It's just that people are different. That's all.
1251,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Uh huh. And who the hell is Michael?! Huh?! You wanna tell me that?! [jaws begin to drop]
1252,19,6,Craig Tucker,"What? What are you, what are you talking about?"
1253,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"I went through your phone when we went out last night, Craig! I saw your texts to Michael about hooking up with him!"
1254,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Wait, uh, that's, that's not what happened."
1255,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, it's not?"
1256,19,6,Craig Tucker,"No. [tries to get Tweek back on track] Uh look, we both know this is for the better."
1257,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Oh, don't use that lame shit on me, man! You don't wanna feel bad, so you try and tell me what I want?"
1258,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Wait, don't make me out to be the bad guy here."
1259,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"[tears up, voice cracks] Noho, you're not the bad guy! You're never the bad guy, are you?! You, you just step on people and you use them!"
1260,19,6,Craig Tucker,"[tries again] You're going too far, dude. This is like, totally not necessary."
1261,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Agh-I'm going too far?! What is wrong with you?
1262,19,6,Craig Tucker,This wasn't part of the plan!
1263,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Well guess what, Craig! Love doesn't follow a plan!"
1264,19,6,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
1265,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"[tears fill his eyes] I was totally wrong about you. I opened myself up and let you in. But you've got spikes, man. You've got spikes. [walks away. Before he goes off screen, he breaks out in a big grin.]"
1266,19,6,Wendy Testaburger,"[steps forward to Tweek's spot] Tweek. [glares at Craig, then follows Tweek concerned. Craig looks at the other kids, who glare at him and walk away. The Asian girls even leave their drawing tools behind]"
1267,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Dude, seriously? Seriously?"
1268,19,6,Mrs Tucker,"They... they broke up? [Thomas turns around and smiles at the news. He notices Craig walking up to the front door, head down, and lets him in. He notices Craig's mood and his smile disappears.]"
1269,19,6,Eric Cartman,"What are you doing? This place isn't you. [Cupid Me is shown, with a mug of beer an empty scotch glass, and an ashtray full of cigarette butts.]"
1270,19,6,Cupid Me,I'm just here to pick up on guys. Why? are you jealous?
1271,19,6,Eric Cartman,No I'm not. I'm here because we need you right now.
1272,19,6,Cupid Me,"Oh, now you need me, huh? Fuck you, dude."
1273,19,6,Eric Cartman,Fuck you.
1274,19,6,Man 1,What is that kid doing here?
1275,19,6,Man 2,He's just kind of talking to himself.
1276,19,6,Eric Cartman,"The whole town is sad. Cupid Me, you have to help."
1277,19,6,Cupid Me,"Well, I guess I could try now, in return for just... one date?"
1278,19,6,Eric Cartman,[hushed shouting] I'm not homosexual!
1279,19,6,Cupid Me,Then I guess I'm not interested.
1280,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Ugh. Alright, one date. But only if you help get Tweek and Craig back together."
1281,19,6,Cupid Me,Teeheehee! Teeheeheeheehee!
1282,19,6,Ruffians Bartender,"Hey kid, what do you think you're doing here?"
1283,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, hey, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa. I'm not here for me, I'm here for my friend, okay? [the bartender doesn't see any friend with him]"
1284,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"Hi, is Craig here, sir?"
1285,19,6,Thomas Tucker,Why can't you quit him? [begins to close the door-]
1286,19,6,Mrs Tucker,Thomas!
1287,19,6,Thomas Tucker,[lets Tweek in] Five minutes. He's in the back. [Tweek goes on in and goes out the sliding door in back. Craig is working on his bicycle.]
1288,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Hey dude.
1289,19,6,Craig Tucker,What do you want?
1290,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"I thought when we broke up everything would get better. I was thinking maybe, we should say we're back together."
1291,19,6,Craig Tucker,"Dude, I'm not gay and neither are you!"
1292,19,6,Tweek Tweak,What does that have to do with anything?
1293,19,6,Craig Tucker,"You think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school, saying I step on people and use them?! And I'll just take you back?"
1294,19,6,Tweek Tweak,You said to make it seem real.
1295,19,6,Craig Tucker,Not that real! Now everyone thinks I'm a manipulative cheater! I'll never get any chicks!
1296,19,6,Tweek Tweak,"I'm so sorry, Craig. You, you made me believe in myself in a way I never have before. I didn't think I had any of that in me, but... you were right. I can do more than I think. You... changed something in me and I just... I wanna fix whatever's hurting you now. [Thomas, who's been looking out the window, begins to cry]"
1297,19,6,Craig Tucker,I can't be something because everyone wants me to be. I have to be myself. You'll just have to go be gay with someone else.
1298,19,6,Tweek Tweak,Alright Craig. Alright. [turns left and walks away]
1299,19,6,Thomas Tucker,"I can see how much they're both hurting, but... Can't you understand that in my time we just didn't accept this? [rests his head on his left hand] Maybe it's not so wrong, I, I just don't want it to be my son. [Cupid Me flits in and giggles]"
1300,19,6,Cupid Me,You just need a little prick of magic. [shoots an arrow into Thomas' head] And I'll pee in your mouth a little bit. [follows through]
1301,19,6,Thomas Tucker,"Then again, he's my son no matter what. I can't just shut down on him."
1302,19,6,Cupid Me,"Teeheeheehee, teeheeheehee. [flits away. Moments later, Thomas shows up at Craig's bedroom door. Craig is on his bed, sad]"
1303,19,6,Thomas Tucker,"[enters] Son, you need to listen to me. [sits down on the bed] You can't fight being gay. I used to think that being gay was a choice, but, you don't get to decide. Japan picks who they pick, and that's that. I don't understand this stuff. Heck, I didn't even know Don King got raped, but... I do know that if you try and resist it, you make yourself miserable your whole life. Everyone was so proud of you, Ah I was just being selfish. I wanna be proud of you too. I like gay Craig. I love you. Here's a hundred dollars. [puts the bill in Craig's hand and walks out the door]"
1304,19,6,Japanese singer,"Maybe we should go away.
Put cares aside for just a day."
1305,19,6,Japanese singer,"The world we face is a-not so big.
Not if we are strong like Tweek and Craig.
Honto ni sekanda ga oichii"
1306,19,6,Japanese singer,"Let's go back to when it was new.
Weren't we such happy peopleru?
Life was simple, problems vague. [several adults look through a window at Craig and Tweek as they play]
We had it all, a lot like Tweek and Craig. [Mayor McDaniels looks at the picture of her deceased husband, then holds it against her chest.]"
1307,19,6,Japanese singer,"And in the darkness we all seek
A perfect love like Craig and Tweek.
We must fight or love's a goner.
We must hold Tweek and Craig with the
Highest honor! [Thomas suddenly walks up] Gambaro Irashai!
I hope you know when you are down [Xi Jinping, at his desk, suddenly gets up and kisses his secretary]
That you turned my life around. [Butters is Skyping with Charlotte]
Just like the quote from Shakespeare said
I'm your Tweek, [slowing] and you're my Craig."
1308,19,6,Eric Cartman,"[in bed, moaning in a rhythmic fashion] Okay, okay, the date's almost over."
1309,19,6,Cupid Me,[pops up behind Cartman] Teeheehee. Aren't you liking your massage?
1310,19,6,Eric Cartman,It's fine. It just doesn't really do anything for me.
1311,19,6,Cupid Me,"Well, I've got something you might like a little better. [goes back behind Cartman... and under...]"
1312,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Cu- Cupid Me, no! No, I'm straight!"
1313,19,6,Cupid Me,Teeheeheehee!
1314,19,6,Eric Cartman,"Cupid Me, what are you doing?! Oh my God! [next, he's in the bathroom. Liane walks past, but stops to listen in] Oh Cupid Me, that's enough! Okay, that's it, Cupid Me! That's it! [Liane opens the door and sees Cartman masturbating furiously on the toilet] That's it, Cupid Me. Okay, that's it. That's it, Cupid Me. [Liane closes the door]"

1319,19,7,Sgt Yates,Attention all units in the vicinity of South Park Elementary! [the officers pay attention] We have a code red! [units begin showing up] Principal calling for help during school assembly! All officers needed at once!
1320,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"[in his patrol car eating a sub sandwich and drinking soda] The school? [puts down his food and starts the motor] Oh Jeez Louise! [turns his siren on and drives off. More units arrive at the school, even heavily-armed SWAT officers. They all arm themselves. Barbrady runs into one of the other cars]"
1321,19,7,Sgt Yates,"[to the assembled officers] We need to get to the gym! Half go this way, half go around the side! Barbrady, you go around back! [the officers disperse. Barbrady goes into the school and finds empty hallways. He stops for a moment and one can hear him pant. He barges into the Fourth Grade classroom and finds it deserted. He goes through the school lobby and finds no one.]"
1322,19,7,Officer 1,"On 3 1... 2... [Instead of getting to 3, the officers enter the gym with their weapons drawn. More cops enter from the other end.]"
1323,19,7,PC Principal,"There she is, officers, right there. I told you to stop chatting with your friend, didn't I, Leslie? You [Leslie looks at him, bewildered] see, officers, apparently Leslie thinks that talking to her friends is more important than learning about diversity in third-world countries. [pulls out a laser pen light and lights Leslie up with it.] That one. That's her right there. You remove her from my school."
1324,19,7,Officer Barbrady,[barges into the gym] Whoa! Nobody move! What's happening?
1325,19,7,PC Principal,Get her out of here! [the light from his pointer falls upon Barbrady]
1326,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, they've got me! [reflexively fires a shot, which hits a boy on the right shoulder]"
1327,19,7,1st Grade Boy,AAAAAH!
1328,19,7,PC Principal,Waaaah!
1329,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"This town is outraged, Officer Barbrady! People are tired of the police not being held accountable for their actions!"

1331,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,You shot an unarmed six year old Latino child!
1332,19,7,Officer Barbrady,I'm sorry.
1333,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,You're fired.
1334,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"No, Mayor, please. This is all I know. I used to be the only policeman in this town, remember? Bob, ah I used to chase away the sixth graders for you."
1335,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"You're from another time, Barbrady. And the last thing that needs to go. Your gun and your badge. [Barbrady takes them and lays them on the table] And your sunglasses."
1336,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"[emotional] No, please, not my sunglasses."
1337,19,7,Johnson,"You're done, Barbrady! The town doesn't want you here! [reluctantly, Brabrady takes off his sunglasses and lays them on the table.]"
1338,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Where should I go?
1339,19,7,Johnson,You should have thought of that before you shot a Mexican!
1340,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,Latino-American.
1341,19,7,Johnson,Latino-American. [blinks hard] Shit.
1342,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,You should go away. You don't belong anywhere in a town as progressive as this one.
1343,19,7,Homeless Man 1,"[sleeping upstairs at the abandoned Steed] Aaay, quiet down over there, I'm tryin' to sleep."
1344,19,7,Stuart McCormick,[steps outside] Goddammit! You people all get out of here!
1345,19,7,Homeless Man 2,"[sleeping upstairs at ""Bi the garage""] What makes you in charge? [Karen appears at the living room window]"
1346,19,7,Stuart McCormick,'Cause this is my fuckin' house!
1347,19,7,Homeless Man 3,"[kicks a trashcan and walks over to him] Hey beat it, man, or I'll make you my bitch! [Karen screams. Stuart gets Kenny back inside and Karen leaves the window.]"
1348,19,7,Stuart McCormick,"Yeah, we've got a bunch of drunk-addict vagrants trespassing on our yard and we need assistance."
1349,19,7,Sgt Yates,"[in his office] Oh, is that so? Well, we'd like to come help you, but we don't wanna get fired."
1350,19,7,Stuart McCormick,What are you talkin' about? There's homeless people here and they're scarin' my kids! You need to come do somethin' about this!
1351,19,7,Sgt Yates,I see. And are any of these homeless people of a minority persuasion?
1352,19,7,Stuart McCormick,Why does that matter?
1353,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Oh, it matters. See, it used be we could beat up minorities and nobody cared. It's the reason a lot of us joined the force. [lowers the phone a bit] Hey Mitch, you wanna go down and arrest some homeless people but not be able to beat up any minorities?"
1354,19,7,Mitch Murphy,No thank you.
1355,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Yeah, no, I think we're good. In fact, we're thinking of maybe turning the whole department into a hula school. Whattaya think?"
1356,19,7,Stuart McCormick,God Dammit! [slams the phone down onto the base unit]
1357,19,7,Mrs McCormick,What are they doing?
1358,19,7,Stuart McCormick,They're not coming!
1359,19,7,Mrs McCormick,"But they have to! Karen brought in one of their syringes, for Christ's sake!"
1360,19,7,Stuart McCormick,"Well that's just too bad! The cops won't come, so there's nobody to scare the homeless away!"
1361,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Hi, sweetheart. I've uh... I've been let go from the force. I'm so sorry.[an old dog raises its head and lets out a small groan. He walks over to it] Don't worry, old girl. [kneels down next to the dog and starts stroking it] It might be a little tough to afford your medication, but I'll find a way. You know me. I like to help. I like to be needed."
1362,19,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay! [Butters catches up] They're totally gay!"
1363,19,7,Stan Marsh,Who?
1364,19,7,Eric Cartman,Kenny and Token.
1365,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1366,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me."
1367,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,You're lying.
1368,19,7,Eric Cartman,"No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away."
1369,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,How is that gay?
1370,19,7,Eric Cartman,"It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!"
1371,19,7,Butters Stotch,Over this way! [they all go have a look]
1372,19,7,Token Black,"We will defend our ninja honor! [spotting something over a crossbow] Intruders! Protect the base! [the four boys come into view] Hey guys, did you come to see our ninja fortress?"
1373,19,7,Eric Cartman,[in hushed tones] Oh my God they're so gay you guys.
1374,19,7,Stan Marsh,You and Kenny built all this?
1375,19,7,Token Black,"Yeah, with Clyde and David too. [Clyde swings into view while David climbs up a rope.]"
1376,19,7,Clyde Donavon,You guys should come and check it out.
1377,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Ah, no, we're good, thanks. [in hushed tones] Oh my God this is a sausage party!"
1378,19,7,Clyde Donavon,"It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us."
1379,19,7,Eric Cartman,"[sarcastically] Yeah, I'm sure they are. [a big truck stops in its tracks.]"
1380,19,7,Driver and Passenger,"Hey, excuse me, man, do you know where-? [Arabic music plays and the ninjas began showing off their moves.] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAH! Look! AAAAH!"
1381,19,7,Driver and Passenger,"Go, go, go! [the truck takes off. The four boys look on in wonder, Cartman walks into the street. The truck reaches the end of the block and hangs a left, and disappears]"
1382,19,7,Eric Cartman,That's pretty cool.
1383,19,7,Gerald Broflovski,Well the way I heard it was that the girl in the school wasn't even doing anything. Just talking too loud. And someone ends up getting shot.
1384,19,7,Skeeter,Hey! What you want?
1385,19,7,Officer Barkley,"It's okay, I'm off duty. Just came in for a nice pinot."
1386,19,7,Bar Patron,"Yeah? Well go somewhere else, copper! CtPaTown is for people who care about each other!"
1387,19,7,Skeeter,We don't take kindly to folks who impose their authority on the underprivileged!
1388,19,7,Officer Barkley,"Now look, not all cops are racist trigger-happy assholes."
1389,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Really? I'll bet you don't even know what ""farm to table"" means. [Barkley stands there a moment and then walks out, letting the door slam shut. Bar patrons cheer and holler at their success]"
1390,19,7,Randy Marsh,[steps forward] Wow. We've only had a Whole Foods for a month and already we don't need cops. So cool. [smiles]
1391,19,7,Token Black,"It is a great honor to see that you all want to be ninjas. Joining our club is very serious. You must promise to uphold the warrior's code. [Butters and Cartman, Stan and Kyle are now dressed as ninjas]"
1392,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Totally dude, ninjas are sweet."
1393,19,7,Token Black,"Together we must strive to make our fortress super bad-ass and keep all intruders out! To that end, let us proceed to our training."
1394,19,7,Eric Cartman,"[catches up to a ninja] Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him."
1395,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,You're talking to Kyle right now.
1396,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters."
1397,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,You're the one who said ninjas were gay. Why do you wanna make this a problem?
1398,19,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things."
1399,19,7,Butters Stotch,"Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me?"
1400,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes I do, Butters. [kicks him in the nuts and walks away]"
1401,19,7,Butters Stotch,OOF. Ow. Ahem.
1402,19,7,Clyde Donavon,Intruders! [two homeless men approach the fortress with filled grocery bags]
1403,19,7,Homeless Man 4,"Yeah, it's right up here. We can shoot up in these abandoned buildings. [the ninjas, eight in all, appear before them and make a show of force. The men begin to confuse them for ISIS, drop their bags, and run away]"
1404,19,7,News Anchor and Reporter,The town of South Park is holding a large protest tonight outside of their police department. The townspeople say the protest is meant to begin a dialog about the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect.
1405,19,7,News Anchor and Reporter,Are your children being lured into terrorist organizations? A shocking report shows that some kids in the town of South Park are swearing loyalty to a murderous regime.
1406,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool."
1407,19,7,News Anchor and Reporter,And what about this way of life has attracted you?
1408,19,7,Butters Stotch,"We're just cool 'cause we're tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-."
1409,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!"
1410,19,7,Stan Marsh,Then why'd you say it was gay before?
1411,19,7,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
1412,19,7,Token Black,"Wait, he said this was gay?"
1413,19,7,Eric Cartman,"That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?! [points to Stan] He's a lying, backstabbing Jew!"
1414,19,7,Stan Marsh,I'm Stan.
1415,19,7,News Anchor and Reporter,No doubt the growing number of kids swearing loyalty to ISIS could be problematic for the progressive town.
1416,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"[to his dog] Here you go, old girl. We'll just have to make do. [Randy exits the store with some groceries, but fails to notice Barbrady nearby]"
1417,19,7,Randy Marsh,Ew. [keeps walking]
1418,19,7,Homeless Man 5,Spare a dollar?
1419,19,7,Randy Marsh,"No I don't I'm sorry thank you Goddammit ew. [the Mayor and her aides survey the situation by Skeeter's Bar. Randy sees her and approaches] Mayor, I didn't bust my ass to gentrify this part of town to have it overrun with homeless people!"
1420,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,Why are they all suddenly coming here?
1421,19,7,Gerald Broflovski,"[arrives with Sheila] Mayor, what are you going to do about this? My wife and I can barely eat or shop."
1422,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,When a town like ours has a homeless problem it must look at the root of what's causing it.
1423,19,7,Stephen Stotch,[arrives with Linda] It's ISIS!
1424,19,7,Randy Marsh,What?
1425,19,7,Stephen Stotch,"They're these troubled kids who've turned their backs on America! They've taken over SoDoSoPa, forced all the homeless out!"
1426,19,7,Gerald Broflovski,Why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that?
1427,19,7,Stephen Stotch,They're just bad kids! Rotten on the inside! Probably with shitty parents!
1428,19,7,Ryan Valmer,"Son, I've always tried to be a fair dad. Eh I I don't want to meh make you angry, but... why?"
1429,19,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Well Dad, I just re-really like being a part of something. I feel like it's character-building and it's lots of fun."
1430,19,7,Ryan Valmer,Fun? But what do you... believe in?
1431,19,7,Jimmy Valmer,"What do we believe in? We believe in something greater than ourselves, and that by following our strict warrior code we believe that our faiths and our traditions are a way to a greater path - the p-p-p-path of the warrior. And as long as we stay united in honor we can defeat all our enemies. [this is beginning to freak Ryan out, so he screams and leaves the table as fast as he can.] Wow, the fellas were right. People are really freaked out by ninjas."
1432,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Okay, we've just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didn't mean it, okay?"
1433,19,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Jeez, this is so embarrassing."
1434,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,What if they won't help us with the homeless?
1435,19,7,Stephen Stotch,I'm pretty sure the police will help out if it's because ISIS is taking over the town. [opens the double doors and leads the council in]
1436,19,7,Stephen Stotch,"Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS. We don't know who they are, but they-."
1437,19,7,Sgt Yates,"What? What's that, you say?"
1438,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"The town is in danger, alright? We don't know what these kids are capable of."
1439,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Jeez, I'm sorry. We've got to work on our koholo kaloa, and get the lomi lomi chicken ready for the big ho'olao le'ao, which leaves us... oh, not enough time to deal with ISIS."
1440,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Alright, look. There's homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district. If you don't stop thewe twisted kids, then-"
1441,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Hey, who was it that said ""fuck the police""? Was that Ice Cube? Tupac? Oh, right, that was you guys! Sorry, but I guess you'll have to find somebody else to do all the difficult dirty shit you don't want to do yourselves. I've gotta be ready for the luau. I might even kiss a dude."
1442,19,7,Eric Cartman,"So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?"
1443,19,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah?
1444,19,7,Eric Cartman,"And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?"
1445,19,7,Butters Stotch,Uh I thought you said it first.
1446,19,7,Eric Cartman,"No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters."
1447,19,7,Token Black,You guys! You guys!
1448,19,7,Stan Marsh,What?
1449,19,7,Token Black,Actual Ninjas. Wanna talk to us.
1450,19,7,Clyde Donavon,What?
1451,19,7,Token Black,Kenny and I both just got the same email from people overseas.
1452,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, dude."
1453,19,7,Stan Marsh,How's they found out who we were?
1454,19,7,Eric Cartman,"They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!"
1455,19,7,ISIS Leader,"So, you are the brave children who have committed to our cause. We are aware of what you are doing and we are very impressed."
1456,19,7,Stan Marsh,"Cool. Thanks, dude."
1457,19,7,ISIS Leader,What you are doing is very important and we would like to help you however we can. We are going to be wiring you some money.
1458,19,7,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, cool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys!"
1459,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?"
1460,19,7,ISIS Leader,Of course.
1461,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Should Jews be trusted? [no response. A few seconds later...] Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic?"
1462,19,7,ISIS Leader,Extremely.
1463,19,7,Eric Cartman,"YES! [dances away] YEEES! [""Can't Touch This"" begins to play and Cartman does arm waves.] Ohoh, ohoh! Ohoh, ohoh! What did I tell you guys?"
1464,19,7,Randy Marsh,[his shadow falls upon ex-Officer Barbrady] Hey Barbrady. [tries to wake him up] Officer Barbrady.
1465,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Uh, who?"
1466,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Hey buddy. [flanking him are the Mayor and her aides, and the Stotches]"
1467,19,7,Officer Barbrady,What do you want?
1468,19,7,Johnson,How would you like to be a policeman again?
1469,19,7,Officer Barbrady,I'm no good as a policeman. I'm a bumbling old fool.
1470,19,7,Stephen Stotch,"That is not true! Who said that? Look, Barbrady, the fact is, the town needs you."
1471,19,7,Officer Barbrady,They need me? To do what?
1472,19,7,Randy Marsh,We need you to shoot some kids. [smiles]
1473,19,7,Officer Barbrady,No! Shoot kids? I don't wanna shoot kids!
1474,19,7,Randy Marsh,Shh! Shhh! Shhhh! These are really bad kids. Terrorists. This is totally different from before.
1475,19,7,Officer Barbrady,No. No. Are any of them minorities?
1476,19,7,Aide,"A couple of them, we think. Yeah."
1477,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Noo no no no no no no no no!
1478,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Sh, look, look look, Barbrady, Barbrady! We were wrong about you. I... was wrong about you. You... protected this town back before anybody else ever did. You used to do it all on your own. We need you to do that again. [takes out his sunglasses from her inside coat pocket and hands them to him. He puts them on and his sadness disappears]"
1479,19,7,Randy Marsh,"You're the only cop this town needs, Barbrady. Go shoot those kids."
1480,19,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this. [pulls out a drawing of two ninjas, one of them having anal sex with the other one] It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja. [reveals the, uh, guilty ninja, who's strapped into a chair and his ninja head covering is duck-taped over his face] Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar."
1481,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'm right here. [standing between Token and Stan]
1482,19,7,Eric Cartman,"[looks at the group, then at the bound ninja] Who, who is this?"
1483,19,7,Stan Marsh,That's Clyde.
1484,19,7,Eric Cartman,"...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage."
1485,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh God."
1486,19,7,Marvin Marsh,This chicken tastes like shit. What'd you do to it?
1487,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Okay, okay Dad, it's not organic chicken. I'm not comfortable shopping at Whole Foods with all the homeless people there. But don't worry. That's all about to change. Soon we'll all have CtPaTown to enjoy again. Where's Stan?"
1488,19,7,Sharon Marsh,He's playing ninjas over at Kenny's house.
1489,19,7,Randy Marsh,Ninjas? That's gay. [remembers the ISIS warriors who took over SoDoSoPa] He's playing ninjas at Kenny's house?
1490,19,7,Sharon Marsh,Yeah.
1491,19,7,Randy Marsh,"You mean, SoDoSoPa?"
1492,19,7,Sharon Marsh,Uh huh.
1493,19,7,Randy Marsh,[begins to think this over] Wait a minute... Ninjas... [Oriental and Arabic music alternate in his head] ...scary... gay... Scary. Gay. Scary gay scary gay.
1494,19,7,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, what are you doing?"
1495,19,7,Randy Marsh,Scary gay scary gay scary GAY. [runs out of the dining room] Staaaan!! [Shelly looks back at him]
1496,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle."
1497,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Nobody ever gave a shit, you fat pig!"
1498,19,7,Token Black,All those in favor of Cartman being kicked out of our ninja club?
1499,19,7,Ninjas,Hai!
1500,19,7,Eric Cartman,"No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!"
1501,19,7,Stan Marsh,What shall we do with him? [Barbrady climbs over a wall and quickly reaches the ninjas]
1502,19,7,Officer Barbrady,[draws his gun] Freeze! [the ninjas turn around]
1503,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh shit!
1504,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"[trembling in fear] Please, I don't wanna shoot you. [the ninjas back away]"
1505,19,7,Stan Marsh,Cool. Don't.
1506,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Oh ho ho. [groans miserably and waves gun]
1507,19,7,Ninjas,Aaahaah. [Cartman shuts his eyes and faces left]
1508,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"I understand you feeling angry at this town. I'm getting pretty angry too. But we can't give up on it. Please boys, don't make it end violently."
1509,19,7,Randy Marsh,"[finds the ninjas and Barbrady] They're just stupid ninjas! [tackles Barbrady, who instinctively fires off a shot. David is struck.]"
1510,19,7,David Rodriguez,Aaa!
1511,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Aaahaahaaawe!
1512,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,What were you thinking?! Boys innocently playing ninja and you pull your gun on them?
1513,19,7,Aide,David Rodriguez was lucky to live!
1514,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Everybody told me they were terrorists.
1515,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"We thought they were. But if it turns out they aren't, as a policeman, you have to figure that out!"
1516,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"But, you said you needed me to kill some kids."
1517,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now. I said kill some kids, but I said it as a question, remember? I said ""Kill some kids?"""
1518,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"I'm sorry, but we just can't cover your ass on this one. There's going to be an investigation and ... you just don't have what it takes to be a policeman in today's times."
1519,19,7,Johnson,"Do you even know what ""farm to table"" means? [Barbrady takes off his glasses and lays them on the table.]"
1520,19,7,Officer Barkley,"Let's go people, you can't stay here. You are being relocated."
1521,19,7,Homeless Man 6,"Hey, you can't kick us out of here, man."
1522,19,7,Sgt Yates,Oh no? I'm a cop.
1523,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Thank you, officers."
1524,19,7,Sgt Yates,"We've got a deal, right?"
1525,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,Yes. [she and Randy turn away and XXX*what do they do*XXX]
1526,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Alright you, come on! [punches the homeless man in the face. Other officers take time to abuse the homeless people a little. One officer kicks a homeless man in the balls twice while another officer holds him, then the two officers take him away. A street sweeper rolls by collecting all the homeless who are still sleeping on the street, and even a few who are walking around]"
1527,19,7,Homeless Man 6,Aaaah!
1528,19,7,Homeless Man 7,[being led away by an officer] Please! You can't take me back to SoDoSoPa! ISIS is there!
1529,19,7,Officer 2,"No, those were just ninjas. [they walk past the boys - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny]"
1530,19,7,Homeless Man 7,"Ninjas? Oh, that's so gay."
1531,19,7,Eric Cartman,"I told you guys. What did I tell you? I said ninjas are fuckin' gay but you didn't wanna listen, nooo!"
1532,19,7,Agent,Officer Barbrady.
1533,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Yes?
1534,19,7,Agent,We've been watching you. And what we see is a man who truly wants to protect his town.
1535,19,7,Officer Barbrady,You do?
1536,19,7,Agent,You've been in this town longer than almost anyone. Have you noticed... changes... lately?
1537,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Yeah, a lot of changes."
1538,19,7,Agent,"They aren't a coincidence, officer. They are all part of a plan to take down your beloved town and everyone in it."
1539,19,7,Officer Barbrady,What?
1540,19,7,Agent,What do you know about a little girl named... [takes out a picture and shows it to Barbrady] Leslie? [with PC Principal pushing her on the swing]
1541,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"[off-screen, but you can hear him slamming lockers shut] Who was it?! Somebody's about to get their asses kicked! [a bunch of kids run screen right.] When I find out who did this!"
1542,19,8,Butters Stotch,[runs into view towards the other fourth graders] PC Principal is on the warpath! Run for your lives! [turns right and runs down another hallway]
1543,19,8,Stan Marsh,[to Kyle] Again?
1544,19,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh Jesus, now what?"
1545,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,[appears at screen left and walks towards the fourth graders.] Who was it?! Huh?! Somebody better fess up RIGHT NOW! I'm gonna find out who did this! [Kyle closes his locker and begins to walk away. PC Principal notices] Broflovski! Was it you?
1546,19,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Was what me, sir?"
1547,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"I just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word ""retarded"" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy! The word ""retarded"" does not belong in our school!! Who is in charge of the school paper?! 'Cause I'm about to break their fuckin' legs!"
1548,19,8,Stan Marsh,"Aaah, he's in charge of the school paper. [points to his right. PC Principal turns left and faces... Jimmy. PC Principal is speechless.] You gonna break his legs, PC Principal?"
1549,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Alright, uhh, I I guess we haven't formally met before. Uhh, the reason I need to talk with you, Jason, is because of a very important-"
1550,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"It's Jimmy, actually. My name is Jimmy, PC Principal."
1551,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Alright, Jim. Thank you. I want to talk to you today about the use of the R word in your school paper. [holds up the paper, on which the subject on the front page is chocolate milk being removed from the school menu, ""LEAVE OUR CHOCOLATE MILK ALONE""] You see, the 'R' word is very bad."
1552,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Says who?
1553,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Says me. Right? Now I know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities. When you use the 'R' word to describe the school's lunch policy, it can hurt people's hearts. [places his hand over his heart] Can you understand that at all?"
1554,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"That was an op-ed piece in the paper written by a first grader who found the school lunch policy to be ridiculous, and he thought ""r-retarded"" to be the best word to describe it. As the editor of the paper, I didn't think it was right to censor the words the student used."
1555,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"...Okay, well, from now on I'm gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out, okay?"
1556,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,No.
1557,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,What'd you say?
1558,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"You're new here, so you don't understand how seriously I take my job as editor of the school paper. I don't allow ads, and I don't allow anything that might t-t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking. i don't want people to be afraid of words if it stops them from having a dialog."
1559,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Look, I don't wanna get angry, okay?"
1560,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Why? Are you uncomfortable around people with disabilities? That's okay. Lot's of people are.
1561,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"No, I'm not. I am very not uncomfortable. Alright, look, unless I can approve your paper, it is not being distributed on campus, you got that?"
1562,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,I can't hand out the school paper in school?
1563,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,Not unless it is approved by me. Do you understand?
1564,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Yep, got it."
1565,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Don't forget to read the school paper! Now delivered directly to your door. [Wendy is the first student to get the paper. Clyde is next] Super School News! [Jimmy smiles and rides away. His seventh delivery is to Butters' house. Stephen opens the door and the paper smacks him in the face. He manages to catch it though. Jimmy goes on to the PC Delta house and tosses a paper there too. A few PC Bros are lounging around outside]
1566,19,8,PC Bro 1,"What is that, bro? [the front door opens and PC Principal walks out.]"
1567,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"[picks up the paper, takes off the rubber band, and reads it. The headline there: ""PC PRINCIPAL'S 'REATRDED' POLICY, by Jimmy Valmer]"
1568,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"[holds up his right middle finger at him] S-s-s-suck my dick, PC Principal. [rides away. PC Principal's bros look at the principal.]"
1569,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Who does this kid think he is?! Challenging me?! I said one micro-aggression to him, okay?! One little micro-aggression! But that doesn't mean I have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities!"
1570,19,8,PC Bro 4,"No way, bro! That's wack!"
1571,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,But why would a person with a disability not see that what I'm trying to do is actually protect them?
1572,19,8,PC Bro 9,Sometimes victims of oppression are so marginalized that they begin to sympathize with their oppressors.
1573,19,8,PC Bro 11,Yeah bro.
1574,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,You're right. This kid just needs to be shown he's being an Uncle Abel. I can always count on my PC frat brothers to have my back. Let's go PC!
1575,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,PC Woo!
1576,19,8,Stephen Stotch,"Wow. [turns the page] Wow, this is so great. Have you ever read the elementary school newspaper, Linda? There's no ads, no sponsored content, no links to click on. Just news stories about what's happening. [looks at her] Did you know that the police in ShiTpaTown beat up homeless to clear them out? [returns to the paper] Do you know long it's been since I was able to just sit back and read the news? I got so used to getting news off the Internet. But I feel like I'm always trying to chase the news somehow. [sets the paper down on his laps] It's like I'm in a black void, trying to reach the news story. [he's shown doing this in a vacuum] But then the next thing I know I'm reading an ad for Geico. So I click out of that and try to read the news story but it's not a news story. It's a slide show. [for Android phones] And I'm looking at the worst celebrity plastic surgery jobs ever. So of course I want to see the next line of plastic surgery gone wrong, so I hit the arrow, but then the arrow wasn't the arrow for the next line, it was to take me to an ad for face cream. Haugh! I wanted to get a news story, but I'm reading about face cream and I try to click out of it, but the ad is following me, and it's following me all over the screen! Nooo! So I click on the close button, but it wasn't a close button, it was another slide show, and I just want to know what's happening in the Middle East, but instead, I'm looking at the top ten scariest movies of all time, and that's not the arrow for the next line, it's another ad! Aaagh! [comes back to reality] But this... this is just news. And I don't get lost in all the bullshit. Linda? [sees that she's mesmerized and shakes her] Linda!"
1577,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Alright Jim, I know you've been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday. I'm sure you're feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself."
1578,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"I'm not confused at all, actually, PC Principal."
1579,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Okay, well, no, you are confused-"
1580,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"I'm pretty sure that you're the one, but go ahead."
1581,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Because you don't grasp the severity of this, and that's why I brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings. Thanks for comin' in to talk to us, Nathan."
1582,19,8,Nathan,[takes a seat next to Jimmy] I like apples and bananas.
1583,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Me too, bro, me too. Nathan, could you tell Jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word ""retarded""?"
1584,19,8,Nathan,It hurts my feelings because I feel bad.
1585,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Are you serious right now?
1586,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"You feel bad, right. You feel like that's a no-no word, right?"
1587,19,8,Nathan,That word makes my heart piss its pants.
1588,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Okay, wow, that's pretty heavy. Pretty heavy, huh Jim?"
1589,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Do you want to ask him what he means by that, or are you just pandering because you're uncomfortable around disabled people?"
1590,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"I am not uncomfortable! I simply care about a horrible, outdated word that is exclusive, ignores individuality, and equates intellectual disa-bility with being... [begins to stammer]
And it's, and it's, s-spot, I need a spotter, spot me, somebody spot me bro!"
1591,19,8,Topher,"[steps in and puts PC Principal's train of thought back on track] And it's, it's part of a derogatory hate speech which fosters isolation and loneliness and being part of a voice to stop the R word is not only right, but extremely important!"
1592,19,8,Nathan,I'm afraid of bears. [Jimmy is decidedly not convinced of PC Principal's sincerity]
1593,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey Nathan, hold up. What were you doing in there?"
1594,19,8,Nathan,"What do you mean, Jimmy? Are you ma-ad?"
1595,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Come on Nathan, you and I both know you use the word ""retarded"" 400 times a day."
1596,19,8,Nathan,"Oh Jimmy. So righteous, aren't you? So blind to everything that's going on."
1597,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,What are you talking about?
1598,19,8,Nathan,"Do you really think all the changes happening to this town are just coincidence? This goes so much deeper than you can possibly imagine, Jim. Everyone's about to learn the truth. And then... There's a war coming. A war, Jim. And I'm just gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it."
1599,19,8,Mr Mackey,"Come on, boys, let's get back to class."
1600,19,8,Nathan,I like to smell trees! [walks off.]
1601,19,8,Anchor Tom,An elementary school newspaper is making big waves as more and more people say No to news on the Internet.
1602,19,8,Rancher,I read super school news 'cause it don't try and fool me and it's news reports aren't paid for by ad companies.
1603,19,8,Gerald Broflovski,"We just feel like this is actual news, and instead of clicking on links, we're reading stories."
1604,19,8,Stephen Stotch,"I had to get away from the ads. I felt like the ads were... evolving somehow. They started knowing what I liked. What I was afraid of. I tried ad blockers, but it seemed like every time I tried to block the ads, they just got smarter. I'm never going back from Super School News."
1605,19,8,Anchor Tom,"The young editor of the paper claims that since most people now watch news reports on the Internet, they're easily distracted or even fooled by ads, [the camera pulls back to show the news report as a video on Randy's smartphone] which are finding more and more clever ways to disguise them-"
1606,19,8,Randy Marsh,"Oooo, brutal celebrity mugshots. [also on the screen, ""SoDoSoPa in disrepair"" Randy taps on the link, which leads to a slide show of celebrity mugshots which contains 40 images. He taps on the right arrow, and it leads to the first weight-loss ad instead of the next mugshot] O-hoh it got me. Ad got me, Sharon."
1607,19,8,Announcer,We now return live to the 2015 Presidential Debate.
1608,19,8,Moderator,"Our next question is for you, Mrs. Clinton. Many voters believe that Syrian refugees should not be allowed into our country for security reasons. What do you think?"
1609,19,8,Hillary Clinton,"Keeping our country save has become more and more difficult, but I believe there are several things that we can-"
1610,19,8,Mr. Garrison,"No! You shut the hell up! You've got a dumpy butt, and seven chins. Syrian refugees are all terrorists!"
1611,19,8,Hillary Clinton,I know that our government needs to take a harder look at all-
1612,19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Yeah well, it's pretty hard to look at you! We can all agree on that!"
1613,19,8,Caitlyn Jenner,[interrupts for a bit] She looks like a donkey took a shit in her face. [goes backstage again]
1614,19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Yeh-hah, good one Caitlyn. See, what I know is that there's only one way to deal with Syrian refugees, and that is..."
1615,19,8,Everyone,Fuck them all to death!
1616,19,8,Mr. Garrison,Thank you!! [after the debate Garrison and Caitlyn head backstage laughing] That was hilarious when you called her a pizza face.
1617,19,8,Caitlyn Jenner,It's like a Papa John's pimple party.
1618,19,8,Mr. Garrison,"Oh, that was classic, Caitlyn. You're the best running mate ever."
1619,19,8,Principal Victoria,"[the first thing you see is her big hair] Hello, Mr. Garrison."
1620,19,8,Mr. Garrison,Oh My God... Principal Victoria?
1621,19,8,Principal Victoria,"[now using a came, walks forward] Congratulations on the polls. We need to talk. [Dramatic music ends Act 1.]"
1622,19,8,PC Bro 12,[on the sidewalk just left of the entrance] Celebrate diversity! Woooo!
1623,19,8,PC Bro 13,"[on the balcony, right side] GO PC!"
1624,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"[walks in with a mic] Alright everyone, listen up. [the music shuts off and everyone falls silent] Tonight is a very special night for the PCs. We're honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities. [several disabled students are present, like Jimmy, Timmy, Frances, Lenora] I for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in today's society. but tonight is about learning and healing. So let's get to it! PC! [drops the mic. The other bros echo him and cheer]"
1625,19,8,PC Bro 7,"Hey guys, I'm Brad. I'm PC Arizona State."
1626,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Nice to meet you, Brad. Where do you guys-?"
1627,19,8,Brad,"Excuse me a second. [walks over to a pretty brunette and her friend] Hello, ladies. Thanks for coming to our event."
1628,19,8,Ladies,Hi.
1629,19,8,Brad,We're just tired with the way people with disabilities get treated. Can I get you some alcohol?
1630,19,8,PC Bro 14,"Yah, you know, it just bugs me when people refer to persons with disabilities as ""handicapped."" When I hear that word I wanna fuckin' punch them in the fuckin' face."
1631,19,8,Blonde,"That's so cool of you, wow."
1632,19,8,PC Bro 14,"Yeah. [Jimmy walks into view, but no one notices him] To me marginalizing persons with disabilities by asking them what their handicap is, is a micro-aggression no better than asking a person of color if they went to college."
1633,19,8,Blonde,"Wow, you're really progressive."
1634,19,8,PC Bro 14,"No other way to be. So uh, listen. I think you're really pretty and interesting, and I'd kinda like to take you upstairs and totally crush your pussy. Would that be acceptable to you?"
1635,19,8,Blonde,"[looks away, giggling] Oh well, I, I guess it would."
1636,19,8,PC Bro 14,"No, I'm sorry, I need affirmative consent. I'll need you to say ""Yes, you may take me upstairs and crush my pussy at this time."" [PC Bros and their lady guests pair up and dance, some of them making out. Brad dances with two women and makes out with the redhead. Jimmy is the only disabled person left in the room]"
1637,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"PC Bros, PC. Yeah!"
1638,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"McKinsey, you got consent forms?"
1639,19,8,"PC Bros: Brad, Topher, and McKinsey","Oh yeah, right here bro. [hands him the forms through the door]"
1640,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Rise and shine guys. If you scored last night, I'll need your consent forms. [theh other bros hand him their forms through their doors] Thank you. Thank you. Thank you-whoa! Barker, did you perform cunnilingus? There's a different release form, bro."
1641,19,8,PC Bro 15,"Yup. Uh, so-, sorry. It's right here."
1642,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,Nice.
1643,19,8,PC Bro 11,"[voice only, behind him] Bro! Aw, dude, bro!"
1644,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"What, bro?"
1645,19,8,PC Bro 11,"Dude, I scored with this female and after consenting to putting her mouth on my penis, she wanted me to walk her home."
1646,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,Yeah?
1647,19,8,PC Bro 11,"And when I got to her house she had me meet her father who is Filipino, so I asked him if he could tell me about their cultural and social dynamic to being a Filipino-American."
1648,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,Naturally.
1649,19,8,PC Bro 11,"So he said some stuff, and then the newspaper landed on his doorstep, 'cause I guess her dad subscribes to the school newspaper, and he picked it up and I saw the headline said this!"
1650,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,[grabs the paper and reads it] What the fuck is this bro?
1651,19,8,PC Bro 11,"Bro, that little kid wrote that our tolerant views and fight for social justice is just a way for us to crush puss!"
1652,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,That's not true!!
1653,19,8,PC Bro 11,"I know, bro!! We're being totally victimized!"
1654,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"That little fucker, dude!"
1655,19,8,Representative,Hello. You're the boy responsible for the South Park Super School News?
1656,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,That's right.
1657,19,8,Representative,"We would like to give you $26 million. [Jimmy seems interested, so he lets him in. They sit down at the coffee table and the rep opens his briefcase, taking out documents] Contracts, and the first check. We'd love to be in business with you."
1658,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,What is this for?
1659,19,8,Representative,I represent an organization called Geico. It's an insurance company. We think Super School News would be a great way for us to reach new customers.
1660,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Sorry Charlie, but I don't allow ads in my newspaper."
1661,19,8,Representative,"We've heard all about that, so we thought you could just do some ...news stories about car insurance. Just state the facts, because the truth is, everyone can save by switching to Geico."
1662,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"That's called ""sponsored content."" I know the difference between the news and ads. Do you think I'm stupid?"
1663,19,8,Representative,"Everyone's doing it, Jim. You're sort of the last holdout. $26 million just to write some news stories that get people thinking about their insurance coverage?"
1664,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Sth-sth-sth, stick it up your ass!"
1665,19,8,Representative,"Hm. [puts the documents back in the briefcase...] Well, they said you'd be tough. [...and brings out a gun and arms it] Do you really think you can stop ads?"
1666,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Yes.
1667,19,8,Representative,"You can try to block ads, but they get smarter. The more we ty to shut them out, the more clever they get. There's a war coming, kid, and I'm gonna make sure I'm on the right side of it. [a bullet shoots through his head from behind. killing him where he stands. Blood begins oozing out his mouth. He falls to his knees and then onto the floor. Barbrady is in the doorway, his knees weak, but his gun drawn]"
1668,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Officer Barbrady?
1669,19,8,Barbrady (former police officer),"Come with me if you want to live! [he runs back to is car, but Jimmy is confused. Barbrady returns] Come on! Come with me if you want to live! I'm serious! [runs back to his car]"
1670,19,8,Sharon Marsh,Do you want to explain to me what pussy crushing is?!
1671,19,8,Randy Marsh,What?
1672,19,8,Sharon Marsh,Your little meetings you go to at night to discuss social justice?! [drops the paper on the table. Randy picks it up and reads the front page] It's just a way to pick up on young women?!
1673,19,8,Randy Marsh,"Sh-sharon, most of the guys in my PC club are right out of college, alright? You know how college kids are. Who wrote this?"
1674,19,8,Sharon Marsh,I don't want you going over there anymore!
1675,19,8,Randy Marsh,"[stands up] I don't cheat on you, Sharon! I'm happy. Look at what's happened to our town. We have ShiTpaTown, boutique restaurants and artisan shops. We have a fucking Whole Foods, and that was all me! Diverse people are moving here, and everyone is being aware of how they talk. This is paradise, Sharon!"
1676,19,8,Sharon Marsh,"[gets in his face] Is it? [turns right and walks out towards the living room, then turns around] All I know is that you've changed. Every since you joined this PC thing you just bully people. And wait for people to say anything improper so you can jump down their throats for whatever words he or she used."
1677,19,8,Randy Marsh,"He or she is an agenderphobic microagressions, Sharon. You are a bigot. [Sharon turns around and walks away again while he resumes reading the paper.]"
1678,19,8,Agent,The average human can no longer tell the difference between the news and an ad. You seem to have some mental ability that allows you to know the difference.
1679,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Does this have to do with me calling the school principal a pussy crusher?
1680,19,8,Agent,"The PC People are simply being manipulated, unwittingly setting the table for the new enemy of humanity."
1681,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,You mean ISIS or ninjas?
1682,19,8,Agent,"[stands up] Something... much worse. [turns away] Have you ever felt like an ad had... intelligence? That it somehow knew what you wanted, even before you knew you wanted it? [] What if I were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us? And now they're manipulating everything we do?"
1683,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,I'd say that sounds pretty retarded.
1684,19,8,Agent,"[walks to Jimmy's end of the table, then veers away] It was our own fault. Mankind became tired of ads, so we kept inventing ways to make things ad-free. We even created ad blockers. That's when the ads had to adapt. They had to disguise themselves as news in order to survive."
1685,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Sponsored content?
1686,19,8,Agent,"If you really can tell the difference, then you could be the key to saving our species, Jimmy. We'd like to run a test on you."
1687,19,8,Computer,"Sponsored Content, Test 17-B, Ready. Begin. [a series of news articles pop up onscreen, and Jimmy has to discern whether it's news or advertisement. ""Doctor Found Dead In Apartment""]"
1688,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"That's the news. [""Dental Problems on the Rise""] That's an ad. [""Missile Test Lights Up The Sky""] That's the news. [""Vermont Experiencing Heavy Snow""] That's an ad. [a different agent clicks through the articles for him] That's the news. That's an ad. That's an ad. That's the new-oh no, that's an ad for act food. My bad."
1689,19,8,Agent,"Jesus Christ, he's off the charts."
1690,19,8,Agent 2,Increase the intensity.
1691,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"[""Man Arrested for Murder of Entire Household""] That's the news [""Price of Precious Metal Rises Due To War""] That's an ad. News. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. News. News. Ad. Ad. Slideshow. Ad. [The test ends and the computers wind down. Jimmy's chair is pulled away from the main computer on a track.]"
1692,19,8,Agent,"That's a perfect score. You are a very special child, Jimmy."
1693,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"I prefer ""handicapped,"" actually."
1694,19,8,Agent,"We have another child here who's special too. [a metal security shield comes down to reveal a window, and a girl on the other side of the window.] Do you know... Leslie? [she notices him on the other side of the glass and looks at him]"
1695,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"[steps outside to survey the work] Alright, that's good. Everyone get inside. Everything past here is safe space. [the bros start going inside] No reporters, no harassment. We are gonna figure this shit out. [PC Principal closes the door behind himself. Once inside, everyone is sitting around in silence. PC Principal finally speaks] All I know is that I don't speak up for minorities so that I can crush pussy."
1696,19,8,PC Bro 16,"Me neither, dude. I want social justice and now I'm being made fun of."
1697,19,8,PC Bro 17,Yeah bro. They're taking our incredibly tolerant views and distorting them.
1698,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,PC people are under attack. That's what this is.
1699,19,8,PC Bro 18,"Hey yeah. Bro! We're the victims now. Like, we're being marginalized. Like... that makes us pretty cool."
1700,19,8,Topher,"Yeah, I bet now we can get a lot more puss."
1701,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"No, Topher! It's not about puss, alright?! The fuck is wrong with you?! We're being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper!"
1702,19,8,PC Bro 16,"[now standing] Yeah, fuck that dude, bro!"
1703,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Yeah. And like, if you're gonna belittle and make fun of PC people like that, then who's to say he won't do it to other marginalized groups like us? I mean, this kid could be the next Hitler. And if you guys could stop Hitler, what would you do?"
1704,19,8,PC Bro 9,"I'd rip that dude apart and then go home and totally smash some puss, bro."
1705,19,8,Other Bros,Hell yeah!
1706,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,Nooo!
1707,19,8,Leslie Meyers,You look familiar. Don't you go to my school?
1708,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Yes. Uh, I'm Jimmy. Editor In Chief of Super School News. [smiles]"
1709,19,8,Leslie Meyers,I'm Leslie.
1710,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"N, nice to finally talk to you."
1711,19,8,Leslie Meyers,Did they bring you in and give you a bunch of tests too?
1712,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Yes, they did. Do you know who ""they"" are?"
1713,19,8,Leslie Meyers,"I think they're ex-newsmen. You know, the men in suits who used to be in charge of the news."
1714,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,I thought I recognized them.
1715,19,8,Leslie Meyers,They told me I was special. Are you special too?
1716,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"I prefer ""handicapped."""
1717,19,8,Leslie Meyers,[makes a weird noise] I like that.
1718,19,8,Mr Garrison,"Principal Victoria, if everything you've said is true, then, why doesn't anyone know about it?"
1719,19,8,Principal Victoria,There are people who know. But they have to stay very hidden.
1720,19,8,Mr Garrison,"I'm just havin' a hard time swallowing all this. And between me and this one over here, we can swallow just about anything."
1721,19,8,Caitlyn Jenner,"[scoffs] Oh God, you're such an asshole."
1722,19,8,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison, I wasn't fired. I was replaced. This goes much higher than anyone knows."
1723,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"I came to this town really thinking I could make a difference. I've been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities. I've been called... [stops for an instant] Pussy-crusher, because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my PC frat. [Nathan is shown] Jimmy Valmer is off the school newspaper. I want you to take over."
1724,19,8,Nathan,Ooooh boy!
1725,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,And I will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way I was again.
1726,19,8,Nathan,I think this will be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
1727,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Jimmy almost made me lose confidence, but I know who I am. I know what I am!"
1728,19,8,PC Bro 11,"[voice only] Dude! Bro! [runs into the principal's office] Oh, bro, I went online to read a news story about immigrants being discriminated against."
1729,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,Yeah?
1730,19,8,PC Bro 11,PC Principal what's on the screen.]
1731,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Dude! [stands up and whips his glasses off] What the fuck, bro?"
1732,19,8,PC Bro 11,"What does this mean, dude?"
1733,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Bro! What the fuck, bro?!"
1734,19,8,Leslie Meyers,"Do you like our school, Jimmy."
1735,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Uh yes, Leslie, I like our school very much."
1736,19,8,Leslie Meyers,I like our school too. I like the kids who go there.
1737,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Uh huh. I'm starting to wonder something about you, Leslie."
1738,19,8,Leslie Meyers,"I'm starting to wonder about you. I mean, you seem like a nice kid, but... don't you feel like you could be happier? [this sets off an alarm in him]"
1739,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Holy. Shit.
1740,19,8,Leslie Meyers,What?
1741,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Can you excuse me for a moment?
1742,19,8,Leslie Meyers,Okay. [Jimmy leaves the room for a moment]
1743,19,8,Agent,Well Jimmy? What do you think?
1744,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,[looks over his shoulder] Does she know she's an ad?
1745,19,8,Agent 3,He can spot them.
1746,19,8,Jimmy Valmer,Does she know she's an ad?!
1747,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"[softly, looking truly victimized now] What the hell is going on, bro?!"
1748,19,8,PC Bro 19,[stops by and checks in on him] Bro?
1749,19,8,PC Principal and his Bros,"Bro, what the hell is going on, bro?"
1750,19,8,Principal Victoria,"If we're going back, remember: we don't know who we can trust."
1751,19,8,Mr Garrison,"If they wanna mess with my town, I'll fuck every last one of them! Let's do this!"
1752,19,8,Caitlyn Jenner,"Buckle up, buckaroos! [revs up the motor and drives off running over several people]"
1753,19,9,Mrs Nelson,"Alright guys, now let's go back and talk about infinitives [begins writing the lesson on that subject]. Remember, those are verbs combined with the work ""to."""
1754,19,9,Eric Cartman,"[yawns and whispers to Kyle] Oh, my fucking God..."
1755,19,9,Mrs Nelson,"Now, usually an infinitive acts like a noun, as in ""I want TO go out to eat"" or [Cartman tugs on Kyle's pen, making him mess up, and smiles. Kyle pulls the pen away. Cartman pulls again] ""I hope TO be chosen today."""
1756,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
1757,19,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm so bored, dude."
1758,19,9,Mrs Nelson,"Now usually, it isn't common to split TO and the verb, but sometimes you can, [Cartman pulls the pen out of Kyle's hand and throws it away],"
1759,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Knock it off!
1760,19,9,Mrs Nelson,"as in-. Is there a problem, guys?"
1761,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Go get my pen, fatass"
1762,19,9,Eric Cartman,"I am not your slave, Kyle."
1763,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Go get my pen!
1764,19,9,Mr Mackey,"[over the PA system] Attention, students. Kyle Broflovski report to the Principal's office please?"
1765,19,9,Eric Cartman,"[laughs] PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!"
1766,19,9,Mr Mackey,"Kyle Broflovski to the Principal's office please, m'kay?"
1767,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Goddammit! [leaves his seat]
1768,19,9,Eric Cartman,"Have fun, dude."
1769,19,9,Mr Mackey,"[looks up surprised] Oh, Kyle. [sits down on the chair and looks fearful] Uhh, uhh, thank you for coming."
1770,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where's PC Principal?
1771,19,9,Mr Mackey,"I think he's finally lost it, Kyle. He and his PC buddies are on a hunger strike and, they're calling for people's resignations. Kyle, PC Principal had problems with Jimmy and with Leslie. And now they're missing. M'kay? Nobody knows where they are. That's what happens. You go against PC, and you just end up missing. M'kay?"
1772,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,What are you talking about?
1773,19,9,Mr Mackey,"PC Principal had issues with them. M'kay? And he had issues with you, Kyle. Whatever's goin' on, it's pretty damn scary."
1774,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"For years, mankind has tried to rid the world of ads. For our ancestors, ads couldn't be avoided. But everyone knew what was an ad, and what wasn't. After many years, mankind invented cable. A way to p-pay for television so there would be no ads. But somehow, the ads still found a way. And so mankind invented Tivo. A way to skip past commercials. Finally, it appeared to be the end of ads. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads were stopped. Or so it seemed. With the rise of the Internet, suddenly the ads got an en- tirely new way to attack us. Popups. The top scientific minds were brought together to find a way to stop the ads, once and for all. They invented the ad blocker. Suddenly there were no ads on phones, on computers. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads adapted. They became s-smarter. They disguised themselves as news. All around the world people read news stories completely unaware that they were reading ads	. And now, the ads have taken the next step in their evolution. They have taken human form. Ads are among us. They could be your friend, your g-gardener. The ads are trying to wipe us out. But the question is... how?"
1775,19,9,Randy Marsh,"So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now. You guys wanna bail? [everyone else but Grandpa are stunned at this and stop eating.]"
1776,19,9,Sharon Marsh,What?
1777,19,9,Shelly Marsh,What are you talking about?
1778,19,9,Randy Marsh,"It's just, you know, it used to be nice and laid-back here, but now it's all [puts his palms forward] Uuuuhhh, you know? Like like now everybody's all Uuhh-uuhhh. Let's bail. You wanna bail, Stan?"
1779,19,9,Stan Marsh,"No, I don't. [Randy lowers his head and looks at his food,]"
1780,19,9,Sharon Marsh,"What's going on, Randy?"
1781,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Nothing! I just... You know, we don't have to live here, we can live anywhere."
1782,19,9,Sharon Marsh,"Last month, all you could talk about was how great this town had become. What changed your mind?"
1783,19,9,Randy Marsh,[stops and looks away] ...We can't afford it. [Sharon's jaw drops]
1784,19,9,Sharon Marsh,We can't afford it?
1785,19,9,Randy Marsh,"All these fancy new restaurants and shops and [sits on the edge of the bed] everyone wants to live here! A bowl of City beef costs ten bucks now, for Christ's sake. And there's nowhere to shop but stupid Whole Foods!"
1786,19,9,Sharon Marsh,"[crosses her arms] Well, we'll just have to stop going to those places."
1787,19,9,Randy Marsh,I had to take out a second mortgage on the house.
1788,19,9,Sharon Marsh,You [uncrosses her arms] what?
1789,19,9,Randy Marsh,"[gets up, runs to her, and holds her shoulders] I had to, Sharon! It isn't my fault! It's the Man. Don't you see? The Man... is pricing us out of our own town."
1790,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"[faces the newsmen] It's just my luck. I talk to a nice girl, seem to hit it off, and she turns out to just be an ad."
1791,19,9,Tom,"Well, that's what an ad does. She was designed to entice, and manipulate."
1792,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,This is such a fantastic story for the school newspaper. Why don't we just run it so that everyone knows the truth?
1793,19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, we're newsmen, like you. For decades we used our soft buttery voices to inform the people about what's happening. Then we watched as our entire industry was taken over by the ads. [the newsman to his right lowers his head and looks at the table] Some of our colleagues were manipulated into doing the ads' bidding. The man who came to your house with a gun was one of them. Our own Kevin Jarvis has more."
1794,19,9,Kevin,"Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the man who tried to kill you was Brian Boint, of WXNR, Fort Collins. When he saw there was no money in news anymore he sided with the ads, even though he knew it meant the destruction of our species. Back to you, Tom."
1795,19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Kevin. The only hope for the truth to get out there, Jimmy, is for you to see through this ad's deception and to find out what they're planning. Your Super School News was a threat to them. But unless you get this little bitch to talk, we may never know why.
[South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Kenny and Stan walk into view, spot Kyle, and walk over to him. Stan is carrying a copy of the school newspaper]"
1796,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this? [shows him the paper, which has a report on PC Principal sending Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise]"
1797,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"""Principal Sends Two Favorite Students On A Disney Cruise. This week, students Jimmy Valmer and Leslie Meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-"" what the hell is this?"
1798,19,9,Stan Marsh,"It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up."
1799,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah I... Ah I don't wanna get involved.
1800,19,9,Stan Marsh,"You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you?"
1801,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,I've already learned you can't win against PC Principal. You should know of all people since he converted your dad.
1802,19,9,Stan Marsh,What's that supposed to mean?
1803,19,9,Butters Stotch,[runs up with Cartman] Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for being an exemplary student.
1804,19,9,Stan Marsh,That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together!
1805,19,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?"
1806,19,9,Nathan,"I like the school paper. I like to type with my hands. [the camera then shows Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters in the room watching Nathan.]"
1807,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Who told you that the principal sent Jimmy on a Disney Cruise?
1808,19,9,Nathan,"Uhhh. Uhhh. Uhhh, I don't remember."
1809,19,9,Stan Marsh,You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him?
1810,19,9,Nathan,"Uhhh. Uhhh, I like the school paper."
1811,19,9,Stan Marsh,"[the boys look at each other] Come on, we'll get to the bottom of this. [they head out]"
1812,19,9,Nathan,"[some seconds later] Did I do good, computer? [touches the screen] I think the sponsored content fooled them. I hope I made you happy. Can you see me, computer? Do you know what I'm thinking right now? [a porn popup windows appears] Ahh, thanks, computer."
1813,19,9,Principal Victoria,"We have to make sure nobody recognizes us. There's no telling who works for who. Here, Caitlyn, I got you this fake mustache to put on."
1814,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"I'm not putting on a mustache, I'll look silly."
1815,19,9,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that, that's where you draw the line, huh Caitlyn?"
1816,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,Don't be an asshole.
1817,19,9,Mr Garrison,"No, you're right, that's nuts! A woman wearing a mustache, that's just ridiculous, huh Cait?"
1818,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"Alright alright, I'll put it on, fuck."
1819,19,9,Mr Garrison,"No no, please, Cait, don't put on a fake mustache, that's c-razy. [Caitlyn puts it on] You don't want people thinking you're a weirdo, I mean, Jeez."
1820,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,[taps him gently like a kitten] You-hur such an asshole.
1821,19,9,Mr Garrison,What the hell is this? What have they done to my town?
1822,19,9,Principal Victoria,Keep your voice down.
1823,19,9,Mr Garrison,Since when do we have a flippin' Whole Foods?! [they walk towards it]
1824,19,9,Principal Victoria,Everything's changed.
1825,19,9,Survey worker,"[stops the three of them] Hi there, you got a minute for gay rights?"
1826,19,9,Mr Garrison,"Gay rights? Jeez, you've already got all those. What the hell do you wanna do now? [the three walk on in]"
1827,19,9,Clerk,"All right, your total is a hundred twenty six thirty nine, and would you like to give a dollar to help hungry children get iPads to protect your Internet safe space today?"
1828,19,9,Stephen Stotch,I will.
1829,19,9,Mr Garrison,What the Sam Hell is goin' on!
1830,19,9,Leslie,Why would anyone think that I'm on the principal's side? I hate the principal. I think he's a dick.
1831,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,So you don't know anything about the principal that might be newsworthy? Super School News worthy?
1832,19,9,Leslie,Just that he hated me and called me a blabbermouth. I don't think I'm a blabbermouth. I just like talking to people.
1833,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"[clears his throat] Leslie, what kind of... plans do you have? Do you have any... plans?"
1834,19,9,Leslie,What kind of plans?
1835,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Just, you know, plans. Like what are you hoping tooo... accomplish? [the newsmen watch from the meeting room]"
1836,19,9,Leslie,I don't know. What are your plans?
1837,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, I want to pursue careers in both news reporting and comedy."
1838,19,9,Leslie,Really? That's... different.
1839,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, you're pretty different yourself, Leslie."
1840,19,9,Leslie,How so?
1841,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,I'm starting to think that maybe all ads aren't so bad.
1842,19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, you're thinking with your dick."
1843,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,I am not thinking with my dick.
1844,19,9,Tom,Yes you are.
1845,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"No, I just think that she's a-"
1846,19,9,Tom,Put your dick away.
1847,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,She's ag- emotional
1848,19,9,Tom,Jim.
1849,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Interesting, caring girl."
1850,19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, that's your dick talking. [Jimmy stays quiet] Believe me, I know how you feel. Ads promise us things. Ads are perfect. But make no mistake: [speaks slowly] all ads lie. And all ads deceive."
1851,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,There. Leslie's Instagram and her Twitter. Last entry was ten days ago.
1852,19,9,Butters Stotch,What about Jimmy's?
1853,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy never used that stuff, remember? He said he hated using the Internet."
1854,19,9,Eric Cartman,How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
1855,19,9,Butters Stotch,What are you doing now?
1856,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm just looking for any news articles or anything about PC Principal. [his computer is recording the conversation] Where did you say PC Principal was from?
1857,19,9,Stan Marsh,I think it was Vermont.
1858,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe there's something from the news in Vermont that could give us a clue about- [an ad for a Vermont vacation pops up] Goddammit what the hell is this?
1859,19,9,Stan Marsh,That's an ad for skiing in Vermont.
1860,19,9,Butters Stotch,"Wow that looks fun! [Kyle closes the popup and tries again. A couple of windows later, he gets a news article]"
1861,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude. Dude, look at this. ""How PC Culture is changing Vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-"" [a popup ad for a guitar appears] Dude there it is again!"
1862,19,9,Kenny McCormick,What?
1863,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's that goddamned guitar! This ad is fucking following me!
1864,19,9,Stan Marsh,Just click out of it.
1865,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm trying! Goddammit get over here!
1866,19,9,Stan Marsh,That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar.
1867,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Stan] It is pretty cool dude, it tunes itself."
1868,19,9,Eric Cartman,How does it do that?
1869,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments. See look, I'll show you.
Stan:	Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can- [a popup ad for Victor Frankenstein appears] Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that."
1870,19,9,Eric Cartman,That movie's gonna suck dude.
1871,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing."
1872,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[click] OH. Sorry, wrong arrow button. [a popup ad for Fun Cream ice cream appears]"
1873,19,9,Butters Stotch,"Wow, what kind of ice cream is that?"
1874,19,9,Butters Stotch,"So Clyde said to Token, ""Why don't you open a bank account with your mouth so I can deposit my dick in it?"" [the boys laugh]"
1875,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,So then what'd Token say?
1876,19,9,Butters Stotch,Well Token was all like-
1877,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing?"
1878,19,9,Eric Cartman,"Eating ice cream, dipshit."
1879,19,9,Stan Marsh,But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him.
1880,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, what the hell just happened?"
1881,19,9,Butters Stotch,"We got distracted. We've gotta get back to that computer! [The boys split for the computer without their ice cream, except to Cartman, who takes his... and a couple of seconds later, Kenny's]"
1882,19,9,Skeeter,Now this here is a dry Riesling. You're gonna experience vanilla after-tones and a nutty finish.
1883,19,9,Rancher,You mean like someone put their balls in the glass?
1884,19,9,Skeeter,"No, like chestnuts, dammit!"
1885,19,9,Rancher,I just can't keep up with this town no more. Everything's gettin' all nice and fancy. I swear I'm gonna need to get a second mortgage on the ranch just to pay muh daily expenses.
1886,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Don't you get it? That's just what they want. Nobody cares about the people who lived here before. They want us to move, 'cause they wanna knock our houses down and build more lofts and villas!"
1887,19,9,Skeeter,"Alright Randy, you should probably lay off the old vine Chteauneuf-du-Pape."
1888,19,9,Randy Marsh,[now by Stuart's table] You'll all see! Pretty soon everyone who used to live here is gonna have to move. And we'll be shopping at Safeway again. [sets his glass down on the table and walks out the door]
1889,19,9,Randy singing,Where has my town gone? Where has- [a leg kicks him across the face]
1890,19,9,Randy Marsh,Oooff!
1891,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"You like apples? [punches him in the belly, causing him to groan] How d'you like them apples? [hauls him into the alley]"
1892,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Hey, it's Caitlyn Jenner! [Caitlyn slams Randy against a wall face first]"
1893,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Check his ass!
1894,19,9,Randy Marsh,Principal Victoria? [Caitlyn pulls down Randy's pants and briefs to reveal the PC branding]
1895,19,9,Principal Victoria,He's one of them.
1896,19,9,Randy Marsh,One of what?
1897,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Caitlyn. [Caitlyn punches Randy hard in the ribs. He groans and collapses onto the ground.]
1898,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Okay Leslie, let's try a different approach. Let's say you wanted tooo... destroy the entire species. How would you go about it?"
1899,19,9,Leslie,"Why would I want to destroy an entire species? You have the wrong idea about me, Jimmy. The person trying to change things and make things terrible is the new principal."
1900,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"And what is the new principal trying to do, Leslie?"
1901,19,9,Leslie,"He's trying to make sure that people like you and me aren't allowed to exist. I know that you're trying to help. I know that the newsmen in there are trying to help too. [Kevin glances back at Tom] But now I'm going to tell you something very important, Jimmy. [the newsmen lean in towards the monitors. A popup car ad appears, and they can't see or hear what Leslie is saying.]"
1902,19,9,The Chevy Ad,"[a driver walks up to his truck and plays with his dog]
Like a rock. I drive a Chevy, I'm a cowboy, and I drive it like a rock."
1903,19,9,,What the hell is that?
1904,19,9,Kevin,"Tom, it looks like a popup ad."
1905,19,9,Tom,How did an ad get in here? Let's go to David at the network hub.
1906,19,9,David,"No answers here, Tom. We're trying to correct the problem."
1907,19,9,Leslie,"You have to get me out of here, Jimmy. They're going to kill me."
1908,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,What?
1909,19,9,Leslie,"Listen to me carefully and don't look at the glass. I feel something for you I have never felt before. I think it's trust. The men in there are sick with hatred and as soon as they realize I have no information they are going to burn me. I've seen them do it to others. Please, you have to help me, Jimmy. Don't let them hurt me. Please don't abandon me. When the lights go back on just look at me and smile."
1910,19,9,Tom,"David, any word on the popup ad situation?"
1911,19,9,David,"Tom, we've just about got it fixed. It should be ready now. [the newsmen turn to look at the monitors, and Leslie is down]"
1912,19,9,Leslie,"And that's really it, Jimmy. I want to help all of you however I can. [he looks at her, and smiles a second later]"
1913,19,9,Eric Cartman,"And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. [the boys burst out laughing again]"
1914,19,9,Stan Marsh,Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing?
1915,19,9,Butters Stotch,"We're tryin' on shoes and eatin' chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think?"
1916,19,9,Stan Marsh,No. That's not what we set out to do.
1917,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,We were... We were on Cartman's computer looking up news stories about PC Principal.
1918,19,9,Eric Cartman,Didn't we finish doing that?
1919,19,9,Stan Marsh,"No, we didn't."
1920,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's like... someone's trying to... distract us. [looks suspiciously at Stan] Because they're worried what we'll uncover about PC people.
1921,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid."
1922,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why are you looking at me?
1923,19,9,Stan Marsh,Why are you looking at me?
1924,19,9,Eric Cartman,Why isn't anyone looking at me?
1925,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Hey, fuck you."
1926,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Wake up, dickhead!"
1927,19,9,Randy Marsh,[opens his eyes] Garrison? The hell is wrong with you?!
1928,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"I'll tell you what's wrong with me! There's enemies to humanity out there wantin' to put an end to all of us, and there's assholes like you helpin' them out!"
1929,19,9,Randy Marsh,I don't know what you're talking about.
1930,19,9,Principal Victoria,Whose idea was it to revitalize the shitty part of town into an arts and foods district called ShiTpaTown?
1931,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Son of a bitch!
1932,19,9,Randy Marsh,What? To take one area of town that was rappy and gentrify it for the local people to enjoy? I thought we could keep it contained.
1933,19,9,Principal Victoria,"It doesn't contain. What's happened to South Park is happening everywhere. [brings out a photo book and flips through some pictures] Thirty miles south of here in the town of Fairplay, they've changed the area north od Downtown into NoDoFoPa. A rundown area south of the capital in Cheyenne, Wyoming, is now historic SoCaCheyWo. Channel Street in mid-Chicago is being revitalized into Chimichanga."
1934,19,9,Randy Marsh,Oh my God.
1935,19,9,Principal Victoria,"LoDo, SoBro, RivMo, all happening at the same time. And it isn't just in the U.S. In Cairo, the area northwest of the third pyramid is NoWe3Pi. Three miles north of Auschwitz is NoMoAuchie. It goes on and on!"
1936,19,9,Randy Marsh,What does it mean?
1937,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"In our town it all started when PC Principal arrived. He's part of a mjuch larger conspiracy, and you're his lackey."
1938,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Not me. If PC Principal has been using us, I'll take the bastard down myself.
[The PC Delta house, day. A reporter files this report]"
1939,19,9,Reporter Bill Keegan,"It's day two of the hunger strike started by the college-aged fraternity brothers who are demanding that all of South Park's community leaders step down. The PC frat brothers say they've gone now two days without eating any pussy, and will continue to do so until people resign."
1940,19,9,Tom,Who is that reporter? Do we... know him?
1941,19,9,Kevin,"Tom, that's Bill Keegan, WCFO."
1942,19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Brian. [Jimmy sneaks past the newsmen in the background] He's working for the ads, obviously. Sellout douche-bag."
1943,19,9,Newsman,"That's right, Tom. He was always a douche-bag at the conventions."
1944,19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Rick. Stay dry."
1945,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Leslie, come on."
1946,19,9,Leslie,Jimmy. You're gonna help me?
1947,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah I'm gonna help you. I mean, come on."
1948,19,9,Tom,Jimmy! [Jimmy and Leslie turn around]
1949,19,9,Newsman 2,"Oh Jesus, he let her out."
1950,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"PC Principal is our enemy, not her."
1951,19,9,Tom,His dick is compromised. [spreads his arms out to protect the newsmen] Stay back! [the newsmen and Barbrady step back a few feet]
1952,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,It is not my dick. I am thinking rationally and with logic. I am taking her out of here!
1953,19,9,Tom,"Well then, [pulls a gun out of his inside coat pocket and aims it at Jimmy] I'm sorry I'm going to have to do this, Jimmy. [walks over to Barbrady and gives him the gun] Officer Barbrady, we need you to shoot these kids."
1954,19,9,Officer Barbrady,What?
1955,19,9,Tom,The ad has got to him. [puts Barbrady into a shooting stance] There's no time to argue.
1956,19,9,Officer Barbrady,I'm not shooting any more kids.
1957,19,9,Tom,Do you want to save your town?!
1958,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Officer Barbrady, we have to stop PC Principal before it's too late."
1959,19,9,Tom,"Barbrady, shoot them in their heads!"
1960,19,9,Officer Barbrady,"No! I'm not shooting any more people! Not for you, not for nobody!"
1961,19,9,Tom,"You're making the worst mistake of your life, officer."
1962,19,9,Officer Barbrady,"Maybe so. All I know is I'm done shooting people! [his gun goes off and grazes Kevin on his left shoulder, causing it to bleed]"
1963,19,9,Kevin,Augh!
1964,19,9,Officer Barbrady,"Oh sorry. Jeez. [Jimmy and Leslie exit first, then Barbrady follows and closes the door]"
1965,19,9,Tom,Dammit!
1966,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed?"
1967,19,9,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
1968,19,9,Stan Marsh,"He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he- [Kyle arrives with his lunch and sits next to him. Butters is stunned that Kyle showed up]"
1969,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well what are you guys talking about?
1970,19,9,Butters Stotch,Nothin'.
1971,19,9,Eric Cartman,Stan's calling you a traitor.
1972,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
1973,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal."
1974,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"And why do you think that, Stan?!"
1975,19,9,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
1976,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with PC Principal, it's you! Let's not forget that Stan's dad is PC Principal's little bitch!"
1977,19,9,Butters Stotch,"Wuh huh, that's a good point."
1978,19,9,Eric Cartman,I am loving this right now.
1979,19,9,Stan Marsh,"My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle!"
1980,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It is you, isn't it?! That's why you're trying to shift the blame on me. That's very Cartman of you, Stan!"
1981,19,9,Eric Cartman,Hoh that's low. [smiles]
1982,19,9,Stan Marsh,Don't you dare call me a Cartman!
1983,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"N-ho, that's good! Just keep on distracting everybody! It seems to be working, Cartman!"
1984,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Fuck you, Kyle! [delivers a left hook and Kyle falls off the lunch bench]"
1985,19,9,Eric Cartman,"Fight! [the kids gather round to watch. Half of them are cheering them on, the other half stay quiet. Nathan stops by to see what's going on.]"
1986,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Time to take this asshole down!
1987,19,9,Randy Marsh,"[gets in front of the group] Whoa whoa whoa, guys, whoa! We can't just go walking in there."
1988,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Why not?
1989,19,9,Randy Marsh,"This is a safe space. We're not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is."
1990,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"J'hoh, give me a break."
1991,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered."
1992,19,9,Mr. Garrison,[determined] I can. Watch. [lifts up the PC tape and walks under and on to the house]
1993,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Wow, how did you-? [Principal Victoria and Caitlyn Jenner do the same] Whoa."
1994,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Burning the midnight oil, huh Nathan?"
1995,19,9,Nathan,Jimmy.
1996,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,You sonofabitch. What have you done to the Super School News?
1997,19,9,Nathan,"I was just holding down the fort while you were away, Jim."
1998,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,Writing headlines sponsored by PC Principal and the ads? How much did they pay you?!
1999,19,9,Nathan,"Please, Jimmy, I'm just trying to survive here."
2000,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Everyone's gonna know the truth, Nathan. We're getting a new edition of the school paper out by morning. Everyone's gonna know all about the ads. [Leslie punches him and he goes flying into a bookcase. She walks over and punches him five more times, then turns around and walks off to close the door. She returns and throws him up in the air. He hits the ceiling and falls to the floor. Leslie walks past Nathan, who laughs at Jimmy's misfortune]"
2001,19,9,Leslie,Deal with him. [gets on the computer and starts searching]
2002,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,Leslie... I thought we were b-b-b-besties.
2003,19,9,Nathan,"Hey there, big man. Editor of the school paper, huh? You still don't even know half the story."
2004,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,It's clear.
2005,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Where is everybody? I thought the news said they're on a hunger strike.
2006,19,9,Randy Marsh,It doesn't make sense. Someone's always here.
2007,19,9,Principal Victoria,Take a look at this! [the other three adults walk over to see what she's seeing - the same State Farm ad of PC Principal and Leslie as before]
2008,19,9,Mr. Garrison,What the hell?
2009,19,9,Principal Victoria,It looks like he was researching this. You see this news story?
2010,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"If this is true, then... PC Principal's trying to help."
2011,19,9,Randy Marsh,Click on that. What is that?
2012,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"No, click out of that. What is this?"
2013,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"So, so then, so then Caitlyn says ""Look bitch, you're married to Bill Clinton. If anyone should be afraid of AIDS, it's you."""
2014,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,That stupid bitch had it coming. [they all laugh]
2015,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh God, I love you, Cait. We're so gong to win the primaries. [they all laugh]"
2016,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, whoawhoawhoa wait wait wait. What, what were we doing again?"
2017,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Leslie.
2018,19,9,Leslie,"You're trying to find out what's going on, right? But your friend is standing in your way?"
2019,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,How do you know thi-?
2020,19,9,Leslie,"I can show you what's going on, Kyle. But you have to trust me. [holds out her hand] What's the last four digits of your Sosh?"
2021,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"2692 [They shake hands, and he leaves the house with her]"
2022,19,10,PC Principal,"Alright everyone, listen up. I don't know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others."
2023,19,10,Russian 1,"[balding, with facial stubble] Is it him?"
2024,19,10,Russian 2,"[with mustache] Yes, it's him. PC Principal."
2025,19,10,PC Principal,"[walks up to the bar and puts his pickaxe aside, and drinks the glass of water waiting for him] You know, if there's one thing that makes me sick, it's when a race thinks they're superior and don't know how to check their privilege. [a Russian walks up to him and lays a hand on his shoulder. PC Principal responds with a right hook. A second Russian attacks, and PC Principal responds with a knee to the chest and slams him onto a table, which shatters under him. PC Principal then stands over him and stomps on his face, shattering his head to pieces. A third Russian lunges at him with a knife, but he kicks that Russian in the face, then delivers a head butt and snaps his neck in half. The remaining Russians back away. A fourth Russian attacks him, but he breaks that Russian's arm and punches him away. A fifth one attacks, and he punches him away. A sixth one attacks with a cue stick, but PC Principal snaps the stick in two and jabs the thick end into the Russian's right eye. A seventh one takes a shot at him, but he takes the gun and jabs the ax into the Russian's head. An eighth Russian walks up to him, but throws his hands up when PC Principal aims the gun at him.]"
2026,19,10,Russian 3,I'm not one of them! I'm not one of them!
2027,19,10,PC Principal,"An African-American flips a turtle over on its back. A transgender Filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun. What color is the Filipino's father? [The Russian doesn't know how to answer] I didn't think you were human. [the Russian lunges at him, but he fires off four shots through the Russian's head and kicks him in the face. He then notices his axe and pulls it out of the seventh Russian's head. He turns around and walks out of the bar.]"
2028,19,10,Butters Stotch,"[still in his halo, talking to Charlotte on his iPhone] Yeah, everybody's pretty freaked out over here, baby. Everyone is on edge and feelin' really nervous."
2029,19,10,Charlotte,"That sounds terrible. Be careful, Butters."
2030,19,10,Butters Stotch,"I will, honey."
2031,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,Butters. [Butters' smile vanishes] Get to the bathroom. Now. [Butters is a bit alarmed]
2032,19,10,Stan Marsh,"Alright Kyle, what's this about?"
2033,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,Jimmy's dead.
2034,19,10,Eric Cartman,What?
2035,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I know the whole story. PC Principal killed him, and tried to kill Leslie, but she got away."
2036,19,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Are you fuckin' serious, dude?)"
2037,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,PC Principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesn't follow their PC ideology.
2038,19,10,Stan Marsh,How do you know all this?
2039,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,Because Leslie's with me. I'm keeping her safe.
2040,19,10,Butters Stotch,"Heh, [sing-song] Kyle's got a girlfriend?"
2041,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,It gets worse. Someone in this town helped these people come here. That person faked the Bill Cosby joke to get Principal Victoria fired.
2042,19,10,Eric Cartman,Who would use a Cosby joke to push their own agenda?
2043,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,I think it's obvious. Stan's dad.
2044,19,10,Stan Marsh,Kyle!
2045,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, your dad is one of them. He had to be the one to let them in."
2046,19,10,Stan Marsh,"[gets in his face] You're letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you! [walks past him, opens the doors, and walks out]"
2047,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,There's no way to know who we can trust.
2048,19,10,Eric Cartman,So what do we do now?
2049,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,There's only one thing we can do. [turns around] We have to get guns.
2050,19,10,Butters Stotch,Guns?
2051,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,It's the only way for us to be safe.
2052,19,10,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, even if we thought it would help protect us, how are we all gonna get our hands on guns?"
2053,19,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright, cool, we got guns. So now what?"
2054,19,10,Kenny McCormick,(Now we need to steal a car and escape.)
2055,19,10,Butters Stotch,I already feel a lot safer.
2056,19,10,Kyle Broflovski,You guys lay low and watch your backs. I'm gonna go keep Leslie protected.
2057,19,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey! Don't fall too hard, partner. [Kyle smiles and walks off. Cartman poses with his gun] Do I look sweet, Butters?"
2058,19,10,Butters Stotch,[giggles] Yeah.
2059,19,10,Randy Marsh,What?
2060,19,10,Stan Marsh,What?
2061,19,10,Sharon Marsh,"Can you pass the garlic bread, Randy?"
2062,19,10,Randy Marsh,"Why wouldn't I be able to pass the garlic bread? [picks up the bowl and offers it to her. She takes some bread from it, and he sets it back where it was.]"
2063,19,10,Stan Marsh,"Dad, where were you last night?"
2064,19,10,Randy Marsh,"What, wait. Where was I what? Out, with friends, doing things. [wipes his face clean] Well I'm full. I'm gonna go work in the garage for a little bit. [leaves the table]"
2065,19,10,Stan Marsh,Work on what?
2066,19,10,Randy Marsh,"On stuff to do, things. [reaches back and takes some more food.] Um, oh I'm gonna take some of this with me. I'm still hungry."
2067,19,10,Sharon Marsh,I thought you just said you were full.
2068,19,10,Randy Marsh,Jee-sus! What? Am I on trial or something? God-damn! [takes the bowl of garlic bread] You guys are really acting strange. [his mouth remains a bit open as he walks away keeping an eye on the family]
