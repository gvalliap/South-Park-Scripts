0,10,1,Stan Marsh,"You guys, you guys! Chef is going away. [the others look up at him]"
1,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Going away? For how long?
2,10,1,Stan Marsh,Forever.
3,10,1,Chef,I'm sorry boys.
4,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef said he's been bored, so he joining a group called the Super Adventure Club. [Chef opens a pamphlet about the club]"
5,10,1,Chef,Wow!
6,10,1,Mrs Garrison,Chef?? What kind of questions do you think adventuring around the world is gonna answer?!
7,10,1,Chef,What's the meaning of life? Why are we here?
8,10,1,Mrs Garrison,I hope you're making the right choice.
9,10,1,Eric Cartman,I'm gonna miss him. [Butters walks forward a few steps and puts his hand on the sofa] I'm gonna miss Chef and I...and I don't know how to tell him! [turns his head left and cries into his left arm]
10,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, how are we gonna go on? Chef was our fuh...f-ffriend. [Kyle draws close and hugs him]"
11,10,1,Mayor McDaniels,"And we will all miss you, Chef, [Chef watches from a nearby table] but we know you must do what your heart tells you.."
12,10,1,Jimbo Kern,Bye-bye!
13,10,1,Gerald Broflovski,Good-bye!
14,10,1,Mr Mackey,So long!
15,10,1,A Man,"So long, Chef!"
16,10,1,A Sign Holder,"Good-bye, Chef!"
17,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Good-bye, Chef! Have a great time with the Super Adventure Club!"
18,10,1,Chef,[waves] Good-bye! [goes into the plane and disappears from the door. The door closes and the plane taxis away. The town waves good-bye to Chef again and Cartman bawls uncontrollably in a high-pitched voice. The plane climbs into the sky]..
19,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Draw two card, fatass."
20,10,1,Eric Cartman,"[draws two and puts one down] Reverse to you, Jew. [the doorbell rings]"
21,10,1,Stan Marsh,[irritable] I'll get it. [rises and walks over. He opens the door...]
22,10,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
23,10,1,Stan Marsh,He's back!
24,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
25,10,1,Eric Cartman,All right! [applause comes out of nowhere. Chef gives them a group hug]
26,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Chef! I can't believe you're back!
27,10,1,Chef,"Well, it's true."
28,10,1,Stan Marsh,But are you back for good?
29,10,1,Chef,That's right.
30,10,1,Mrs Garrison,Hey everybody! Chef's back!
31,10,1,Townsfolk and Bar Patrons,What? All right! Yeah! [they clear the bar to meet Chef]
32,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Oh, finally! [prances away gleefully after the others]"
33,10,1,Gerald Broflovski,"Wow! It seems like you had a great time with the Super Adventure Club, Chef. They sound like really interesting people."
34,10,1,Chef,Yeah!
35,10,1,Mrs Garrison,"But now that you're back here, does that mean that you're not in the Super Adventure Club anymore?"
36,10,1,Chef,N-no! No.
37,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Ohhh, so have you decided you can still belong to the Super Adventure Club but live here in South Park again?"
38,10,1,Chef,That's right.
39,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Well, it seems like the Super Adventure Club was just what you needed, Chef. You must be feeling very happy that you found a club to belong to with new friends, but that you can also live here in South Park with all your old friends whom you care for deeply. [catches his breath] Right?"
40,10,1,Chef,"That's right, Randy! [everyone laughs approvingly]"
41,10,1,Jimbo Kern,"Well Chef, you're welcome to stay with me until you buy another house."
42,10,1,Chef,"Thank you, Jimbo."
43,10,1,Randy Marsh,"Well, come on everybody. I'm sure Chef would like a little time to get moved back in."
44,10,1,Chef,That's right! Thank you. Good-bye everybody.
45,10,1,Townsfolk and Bar Patrons,Later. Great to have you back. Bye-bye. See ya Chef. See you later. Bye-bye
46,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I- guess we'll see you in school tomorrow, Chef."
47,10,1,Chef,"You bet! Good-bye, children! [the boys are puzzled at the way he's replying to them. It sounds choppy.]"
48,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Right. Uh, see ya."
49,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Uh, guys? Did Chef seem a little, uh, trippy to you?"
50,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[stops. The others stop too. Stan looks up] Well, look. he said he's happier now. Maybe he just needs to rest up a little."
51,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I'm sure whatever that Super Adventure Club does is pretty tiring.
52,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[turns left and cross the street. The others follow] Yeah, but whatever, I'm just glad he's back for good."
53,10,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, me too.)"
54,10,1,A Boy,"[at one of the tables] It's really weird what he said. I don't know, it kind of confused me."
55,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh boy oh boy, I can't wait to have Chef's lunch food again."
56,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. I hope he makes his Salisbury steak with buttered noodles! [a distraught Clyde walks by and stops.]
57,10,1,Clyde Donovan,"You guys, you guys."
58,10,1,Stan Marsh,What?
59,10,1,Clyde Donovan,Something's wrong with Chef. He's saying some really weird stuff.
60,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Like what?
61,10,1,Clyde Donovan,I think... [glances at his food] I think he wants to have sex with me.
62,10,1,Stan Marsh,What??
63,10,1,Clyde Donovan,I gotta- I gotta go. [turns right and walks off]
64,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Weirdo. [Fosse moves up and gets his lunch; the boys follow him in]
65,10,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
66,10,1,The Boys,Hey Chef.
67,10,1,Chef,How's it goin'?
68,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Good.
69,10,1,Chef,"Well, how about I meet you boys after work and we make love?"
70,10,1,Eric Cartman,[The boys are stunned] Excuse me?
71,10,1,Chef,"Come on, children! You're my sexual fantasy. Let's all make sweet love."
72,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,...Chef?? A-are you okay?
73,10,1,Chef,"I want to stick my balls inside your rectum, Kyle."
74,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are you saying??"
75,10,1,Chef,"I'm gonna make love to your asshole, children."
76,10,1,Stan Marsh,...WHAT??
77,10,1,Det Jarvis,"Hi kids, I'm Detective Jarvis. I need to ask you all some difficult questions about your school cafeteria chef."
78,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,This doesn't make any sense!
79,10,1,Det Jarvis,We have some information that all this time Chef has been and still is a pedophile.
80,10,1,Stan Marsh,"No, he's not."
81,10,1,Det Jarvis,[childish voice] Uh huh.
82,10,1,Stan Marsh,"No, he's not."
83,10,1,Det Jarvis,"[childish voice] Yeah, yeah he is so."
84,10,1,Butters,What's a pedophile?
85,10,1,Det Jarvis,"Now, we need some testimony in order to arrest Chef, [whips out generic plush doll with no features on it] so I'm gonna use this doll to ask you kids a few questions. Did Chef ever touch any of you... here? [points to the genital area]"
86,10,1,Stan Marsh,NO!
87,10,1,Det Jarvis,"Okay, did he touch you here? [moves two fingers over the groin]"
88,10,1,The Class,NO!
89,10,1,Det Jarvis,[sits the doll on his right lap and starts rubbing the doll's nipples] Did he ever do this? How about this? [lifts the doll to his face and wags his tongue over the doll's genital area]
90,10,1,Butters,My Uncle Bud did that to me once! [smiles unwittingly]
91,10,1,Det Jarvis,[gets off the desk and walks around] Did Chef ever try one of these on for size? [places the doll face down on the desk and starts humping it]
92,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddammit, Chef isn't like that! Something funny is going on around here!"
93,10,1,Det Jarvis,"[continues humping] Young man, will you PLEASE pay attention! This is very important stuff! Ohhh. Ohhhhhh."
94,10,1,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
95,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[the boys look at each other] Chef, the police are asking questions about you!"
96,10,1,Chef,"Oh really? Well, let's all go home and make love."
97,10,1,Stan Marsh,"No, Chef, we don't wanna make love to you!"
98,10,1,Chef,"Kenny, how would you like to sodomize my black ass?"
99,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, CHEF! You need to get out of here before you get arrested, all right?!"
100,10,1,Chef,"I specialize in your asshole, Kyle. [turns and walks away]"
101,10,1,Eric Cartman,"...Man, I can't believe all this time, Chef just wanted us for sex."
102,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"He didn't want us for sex, fatass! Something is making him say those things."
103,10,1,Kenny McCormick,(Like what?)
104,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Something must have happened to Chef while he was gone. Maybe he hit his head or, or got stuck in some quantum time vortex."
105,10,1,Stan Marsh,Well look: he spent the last three months with that adventurers' club. Maybe they know what happened to him.
106,10,1,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah! I think...)
107,10,1,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
108,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, come on guys!"
109,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, you know what they call a Jewish woman's boobs? Jewbs. [they step off on the other side and approach the front door. Stan reaches over and pulls the rope that rings the house's bell. A black butler opens up]"
110,10,1,Butler,May I help you.
111,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Ahh, hi, can we speak to the head guy or something?"
112,10,1,Butler,Right this way. [the boys enter and the butler leads them to the ]
113,10,1,"Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire","Now, the upper rim of Kilimanjaro should be quite a trek, and so we'll need to have a-"
114,10,1,Butler,"Excuse me, sir. These boys wanted to speak with you."
115,10,1,"Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire","Ahh yes, splendid! Good afternoon, lads! I'm Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire! Welcome, to the Super Adventure Club!"
116,10,1,Club Members,Tally ho!
117,10,1,Mr Connolly,Indeed!
118,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, hi. Our friend joined your club a while back, and now he wants to molest kids. [the members just look around]"
119,10,1,Mr Connolly,"What? Well... well yes, of course! That's what the Super Adventure Club does!"
120,10,1,Eric Cartman,...Huh?
121,10,1,Marksman,We travel the world and have sex with children!
122,10,1,Marine,"Yes, what else would we do?"
123,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, we thought you went exploring and like, hunting and stuff!"
124,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Noo, no, that's the Adventure Club. We're the Super Adventure Club! [turns and approaches a world map from maybe two centuries ago] Next week, we'll be heading to the outer banks of the Amazon, where we will make camp and have sex with children of the Ugani tribe, then it's off to the mighty Himalayas, where we will climb K-2, and molest several Tibetan children on the east summit."
125,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,...Dude!
126,10,1,Mr Connolly,"I know, but it gets even better! From there we will kayak to the fruitful banks of the Mele River in Africa, where the secret and mysterious Hanimi people have children who have never seen a white man's erect penis. Of course, we're always looking for kids to have sex with on the plane rides over to these places, so how would you ALL like to join the Super Adventure Club!"
127,10,1,Stan Marsh,NO!!
128,10,1,Mr Connolly,No? Oh really? Perhaps I should ask you again? [whips out a portable hypnotizer and makes some whistling sound effects] How would you like to join the Super Adventure Club? [more sound effects]
129,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[unaffected] No! [Mr. Connolly tries harder, even stepping forward...]"
130,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what are you doing?!"
131,10,1,Mr Connolly,"[looks at his machine] Oh well, it doesn't work on everybody. [hides it behind his back] Well, so long then."
132,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Just what the hell is that thing?!
133,10,1,Mr Connolly,What? What thing? I don't see anything.
134,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,HA! I knew it!
135,10,1,Stan Marsh,Knew what?
136,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,The reason Chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because he's been brainwashed! By this - fruity little club!
137,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, son of a bitch!"
138,10,1,Chef,"Come on, children. Let's all go home and make love."
139,10,1,Stan Marsh,"You need to see a psychiatrist, Chef. It's for your own good."
140,10,1,Chef,I just like to make love up your butt.
141,10,1,Woman Patient,[turns away] Oh my God!
142,10,1,Nurse,"[comes out to get the next patient] Mr. Chef, is it?"
143,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, come on. [they follow the nurse in]"
144,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Hello, I'm Dr. Neeland. What can I do for you today?"
145,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Hi, uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club."
146,10,1,Dr Neeland,[approaches Chef] Brainwashed.
147,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, he joined the Super Adventure Club, and they convinced him having sex with children was okay with a little thing that goes whrrrrrr."
148,10,1,Dr Neeland,I thought that club was for hiking and kayaking.
149,10,1,Stan Marsh,"No, that's the Adventure Club. The Super Adventure Club has sex with children."
150,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Oh. ...Oh, that's right, yeah."
151,10,1,Chef,"Doctor, do you have- children?"
152,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Why, yes, I have two young boys."
153,10,1,Chef,Have you all been sodomizing your children too?
154,10,1,Dr Neeland,You say he's never been like this before?
155,10,1,Eric Cartman,"No, Chef has always been super-cool."
156,10,1,Chef,I'm gonna make love to the children.
157,10,1,Dr Neeland,He's pretty brainwashed all right. Worst case I've ever seen.
158,10,1,Eric Cartman,So what can we do??
159,10,1,Dr Neeland,"I'm afraid there's no simple answer. When somebody's brainwashed it can take months, even years, to reverse the process."
160,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"But we don't have years! If Chef keeps this up, he's gonna go to jail forever!"
161,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Tell me, what was Chef's favorite thing to do before it was having sex with children?"
162,10,1,Stan Marsh,Having sex with women.
163,10,1,Dr Neeland,Then that's it. We'd better get your friend to the Peppermint Hippo right away.
164,10,1,Peppermint Hippo DJ,"All right guys, be sure to tip the waitresses; this is two for one; put your hands together, this is Monique!"
165,10,1,Chef,"[a long-haired blonde tries to excite him] Aw, come on, children. Let's go home."
166,10,1,Stan Marsh,This isn't working.
167,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Well let's... give it some more time, kids. [a brunette is keeping him busy.]"
168,10,1,Ragged Stripper,[coarse voice] Would you like to daaance???
169,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,No thanks. We're trying to unbrainwash our friend.
170,10,1,Ragged Stripper,[walks away] Daaance??? Anybody wanna daaance???
171,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Come on, bitch! Dance!"
172,10,1,Blonde Stripper,"Up yours, fatty."
173,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Bitch, I'll twist your nuts off!"
174,10,1,Peppermint Hippo DJ,"All right guys, help me feel it out to them; we got a featured dancer coming out next; put your hands together for... Spontaneous Bootay! [an immense black stripper walks out, down the runway, and to the stripper pole, stout enough to hold her up. Chef leans his head to the right to get a better look.]"
175,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on guys, we might as well go. [the boys prepare to leave. The obese stripper can move, though, and Chef is interested. He drops the blonde off and approaches the stage]"
176,10,1,Chef,God-damn!
177,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we're leaving."
178,10,1,Dr Neeland,"Nono, wait. Let him go. [Chef moves closer and stands in awe of Spontaneous Bootay]"
179,10,1,Spontaneous Bootay,"[walks up to Chef] Come here, chubby. [buries his face between her breasts and rattles it with them, then turns around and buries his face between her ass cheeks and rattles it with them as well. She releases him from their hold]"
180,10,1,Chef,Wait a minute.
181,10,1,Stan Marsh,He's remembering.
182,10,1,Chef,Children! What have I done?
183,10,1,Eric Cartman,"It's okay Chef. Go on, remember!"
184,10,1,Chef,I'm goinna- I'm gonna-
185,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Chef! You can do it!"
186,10,1,Chef,"I'm gonna make love to you woman, 'gonna lay you down by the fire!"
187,10,1,The Boys,Yay!
188,10,1,Kenny McCormick,(Chef!)
189,10,1,Chef,"Hey children, everybody! I'm back! [a tranquilizer dart flies in on his left side and strikes him under the ear, behind the jaw, and his smile vanishes] Ow."
190,10,1,Mr Connolly,"[The Club is there] Great shot, William! Hit him with another. [William, dressed in outback gear, blows another dart out through a tube. This one lands in Chef's left arm]"
191,10,1,Chef,Oh! [gets groggy quickly and drops like a sack of potatoes.]
192,10,1,The Boys,Chef!
193,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Tally ho, lads! I must say you're starting to become quite a thorn in my balls."
194,10,1,Stan Marsh,Where's Chef?! What have you done with him?!
195,10,1,Mr Connolly,He's safe. [presses a remote control. The main screen comes on and Chef is shown strapped down to a bed while William sits in a chair at its foot] He's fasting in the Deprivation Room and being read the Super Adventure Club manual. We've got to undo the damage you've done.
196,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Look: If you wanna go around the world molesting kids, that's totally fine. But why do you need Chef?!"
197,10,1,Mr Connolly,"We don't need him, he needs us! Our club offers hope. Do you think we go around the world molesting children just because it feels really really really really good?! No! Our club has a message! And a secret that explains the mysteries of life!"
198,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Oh Jesus, here we go."
199,10,1,Mr Connolly,Very well. I'm now going to tell you the secret of the Super Adventure Club.
200,10,1,Stan Marsh,We don't wanna hear it.
201,10,1,Mr Connolly,"You see, the Super Adventure Club was founded by the greatest explorer of all time, William P. Phinehas! [a gregarious man with an open smile in the picture] Phinehas climbed the highest peaks, tamed the mightiest rivers, [a shot of him climbing up a mountain] but every time he got somewhere, he realized that other explorers had beat him to it. [A shot of Phinehas reaching a summit, only to find two Brits there, celebrating] Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas! [Phinehas with some Australian natives] Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal. [a shot of him with those kids] But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal."
202,10,1,Stan Marsh,Immortal?
203,10,1,Mr Connolly,"He discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies. [a graphic of kid bodies appears, and bright dots dapple them and move around] And when an adult has sex with a child, the marlocks implode, feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality, so saith the ruler of Bethos. [a blue monster alien with a bright red crown. Next shot, Phinehas in the gondola of a hot-air balloon with several boys] Phinehas traveled the world, loving many, many children, and he lived for eternity. Until he was hit by a train in 1892. [a shot of Phinehas' body on the train's bumper]"
204,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,...Do you realize how retarded that sounds?
205,10,1,Mr Connolly,Is it any more retarded than the idea of God sending his son to die for our sins? Is it any more retarded than Buddha sitting beneath a tree for twenty years?
206,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it's way, way more retarded."
207,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Well, now that you know our club secrets, it appears you ... leave us no choice. I'm afraid we're going to have to... ask you to leave. [dramatic fanfare]"
208,10,1,Stan Marsh,We're not leaving without Chef.
209,10,1,Mr Connolly,"If you choose not to leave, then I'm afraid we're just going to have to ... call security and make you leave. [dramatic fanfare] You'll be let out by security and it will be super-embarrassing and everyone here will see! [laughs more and more sinisterly. Moments later...] Okay, you know how like, when you want people to leave but they won't leave, it's really frustrating?"
210,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,We're not going anywhere without Chef.
211,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Cool people leave before they've overstayed their welcome. [the boys do not move] You petulant fools! You just had to push it, didn't you? You don't realize who you're dealing with here. Security! [two officers come out and stand behind the boys] Take these boys to the door."
212,10,1,Guard 1,"All right, come on kids."
213,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,No! Hey!
214,10,1,Mr Connolly,[the lights come on] Haha! Look they're being led out by security! Haha!
215,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[to one of the guards] No, you don't understand! They've got our friend in the Deprivation Room!"
216,10,1,Guard 2,This is their house and they don't want you here. [about to push Stan out the door. Kyle grabs a bat from a nearby jar and whacks the second guard in the back and the first guard on the legs. They both fall. The boys run towards the Deprivation Room]
217,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Sorry, dude, but this fruity little club isn't taking our friend!"
218,10,1,"Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire",And sex with Eskimo children requires some special skills. [the boys break the door down]
219,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Chef, come on!"
220,10,1,Chef,Children!
221,10,1,"Head Adventurer William P. Connolly, Esquire",Get out of here!
222,10,1,Eric Cartman,Kenny! Spin Blossom Nut Squash!
223,10,1,Kenny McCormick,[launches himself into a spinning projectile] (Yeeeeehah!) [smashes William's groin. William doubles over in pain]
224,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[rushes up to Chef] Come on, Chef!"
225,10,1,Chef,[struggling] I can't... break these locks. [those are solid locks indeed]
226,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Here! [walks up to the fallen William, gets a small ax from him, walks up to Chef and chops the locks open. They escape the Deprivation Room]"
227,10,1,Eric Cartman,Run Chef!
228,10,1,Mr Connolly,[turns to see what's happening] What the-? Impossible! I made them leave!
229,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,Get outside! [Chef and the boys reach the front doors]
230,10,1,Mr Connolly,Stop them! [he leads the adventurers in the charge]
231,10,1,Chef,Children! Run! [they run to the other end of the bridge]
232,10,1,Mr Connolly,Stop! [his group runs out of the club. Stan and the others reach the other side]
233,10,1,Stan Marsh,We made it!
234,10,1,Mr Connolly,[calling out] Don't you remember why you left South Park in the first place?? [Chef stops in his tracks]
235,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Chef, come on!"
236,10,1,Mr Connolly,You sought adventure! And why do people seek adventure? Because their lives have become dull and empty!
237,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, he wanted adventure! Not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap! Right Chef? [Chef's hesitance shoes a dilemma] Chef?"
238,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Don't forget all your training, Chef! Stay with us and your life will be GRAND and ETERNAL!"
239,10,1,Stan Marsh,"[softly] Chef, we love you."
240,10,1,Chef,[his eyes shift back and forth with his thoughts] I'm sorry children. [turns and walks towards the club]
241,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No! Chef, they've filled your head with lies! Can't you see that??"
242,10,1,Chef,"Get the hell out of here, children!!"
243,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Yesss. Looks like our fruity little club is safe after all. [a fierce flash of lightning tears the bridge in two, right behind Chef. Fire leaps on him and he screams] NO! [The club end of the bridge smashes into the cliff]"
244,10,1,The Boys,"Chef! [Chef tries to scramble up the bridge, but the fire is too fast and consumes it. He can't climb. The club members approach the edge of the cliff. One of them inadvertently kicks a stone off and it hits Chef, knocking him off the bridge and to his doom below.]"
245,10,1,Chef,"Ack. [He bounces off five jagged rocks before finally...] Ow! Oh! Ah! Oh! Dammit! [...landing on the jagged stub of wood piercing through some rocks, which impales him] Ah- Awww! [blood spreads out under him]"
246,10,1,Stan Marsh,"NO! [Chef struggles to get up, but can't move. A mountain lion leaps down into view]"
247,10,1,Eric Cartman,"A mountain lion! [the lion grabs at Chef's right arm, but is having trouble ripping it off]"
248,10,1,Mr Connolly,We can't lose another member! Shoot it! [the marksman aims and fires]
249,10,1,Chef,Ah!
250,10,1,Marksman,"All right, this! [fires twice, but the lion remains unaffected and continues pulling at Chef's arm]"
251,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,[heartbroken] CHEF! [a huge bear appears]
252,10,1,Eric Cartman,A grizzly bear!
253,10,1,Stan Marsh,Oh my God... They killed Chef.
254,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,You bastards. YOU BASTARDS!
255,10,1,Mr Connolly,Pity. He would have made an excellent child molester. [the men turn and go back to the clubhouse]
256,10,1,Eric Cartman,"Maybe- maybe he's still okay. [the other boys look at him, dumbfounded] No, really. They say the last thing you do before you die is crap your-"
257,10,1,Chef,"POOOT! [a mean final fart, and a soiled log falls out]"
258,10,1,Eric Cartman,Oh never mind.
259,10,1,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's go. [the boys leave the precipice]"
260,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"We're all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives. A lot of us don't agree with the choices Chef has made in the past few days. [Elton John is present] Some of us... feel hurt... and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us. [Stan, Cartman and Kenny look down at their feet] But we can't let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much Chef made us smile. [they perk up a bit] I'm gonna remember Chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song. [Timmy and Jimmy are sitting together] I'm gonna remember Chef... as the guy who gave us advice to live by. [Terrance and Phillip are present, weeping quietly] So you see, we shouldn't be mad at Chef for leaving us. We should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains."
261,10,1,Randy Marsh,Yeah.
262,10,1,Mr Mackey,He's right. [soft applause rises from the crowd]
263,10,1,Kyle Broflovski,"And in the end, I know that somewhere out there... there's the good part of Chef... that's still alive in us all. [smiles]"
264,10,1,Mr Connolly,Is it working? Is it working?
265,10,1,Tech,Yes. We've got a pulse!
266,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Get him in the ICU suit! Hurry! [an ICU suit is fitted onto Chef] We have done it! Good! Raise him up! [Chef and the operating table are tilted upright - but this Chef looks like Darth Vader. He has a glowing red spatula in his right hand] Chef, can you hear me? Say something."
267,10,1,Darth Chef,"Hello there, children. How would you like some Salisbury steak?"
268,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Yes, go on."
269,10,1,Darth Chef,"And for desert, how would you children like to suck on my chocolate salty balls?"
270,10,1,Mr Connolly,Oh? You mean like a chocolate candy?
271,10,1,Darth Chef,"No, I mean my balls."
272,10,1,Mr Connolly,"Yes, YES! Hahahahahahaaa!"
273,10,2,Gerald,"Hey there, Richard!"
274,10,2,Richard Tweek,"[stops shoveling snow and stands up] Oh, hey Gerald. New car?"
275,10,2,Gerald,Yeah. It's a hybrid. I just... I just couldn't sit back and- [closes his eyes as if to banish bad thoughts] be a part of destroying the earth anymore.
276,10,2,Richard Tweek,Well... Good for you.
277,10,2,Gerald,"Oho... [gives a thumbs up, closes his eyes and says with a slight falsetto] Thanks. [drives off and back into town, where Mr. Stotch and Mrs. Garrison observe him drive by]"
278,10,2,Stephen,"Well, there goes the new high-and-mighty Gerald Broflovski."
279,10,2,Mrs Garrison,"Yeah, ever since he got that new hybrid he thinks he's better than everyone else."
280,10,2,Gerald,"You know, the emissions from a vehicle like yours causes irreparable damage to the ozone. I drive a hybrid; it's much better for the environment. [begins to drive away, with his eyes closed] Thanks."
281,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, can we go home? All you ever do since you got this car is drive around and show it off! [a quite-satisfied Gerald stops at the next intersection. Another hybrid car pulls up alongside him]"
282,10,2,Driver,"Hey, is that a hybrid?"
283,10,2,Gerald,"Oh yes. You've got one too, I see."
284,10,2,Driver,"Yeah, I like to be a part of the solution and not part of the problem. Well, anyway, [sticks his thumb up through the passenger window] good for you!"
285,10,2,Gerald,[sticks up his thumb in return and begins to drive away with his eyes closed] Thanks.
286,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[firmly] Dad, I think Ike is starving to death. [Ike's eyes are half-closed and he's getting woozy]"
287,10,2,Gerald,"Hold on, boys. We still have to go to the hardware store, and hand out awareness citations to SUV cars in the parking lot."
288,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
289,10,2,Gerald,"Okay, there's another one. [smiles and looks up after posting a citation on a green car] Aw, man! Look at that! [walks two cars over] Can you believe this?! An SUV with a V8 engine, makes me sick! [begins writing up a citation] ""Ticket for driving a gas-guzzler"""
290,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[catches up] Dad, can we go home, please?"
291,10,2,Gerald,"Look, there's a Jeep over there! Go write them a ticket, Kyle!"
292,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"But Dad, I want-"
293,10,2,Gerald,"NOW, KYLE! [Kyle's eyelids drop and he goes to write the citation. He and Stan cross paths]"
294,10,2,Stan Marsh,Oh hey Kyle.
295,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, hey dude. What are you doing here?"
296,10,2,Stan Marsh,Helping my Dad pick out some cool new power tools. What are you doing?
297,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,[his head drops] Helping my Dad give people fake tickets. [Randy reaches his red SUV and notices the citation on his windshield]
298,10,2,Randy,What's this? [takes the citation and reads it]
299,10,2,Gerald,Oh! Sorry Randy. Looks like you got a ticket.
300,10,2,Randy,"A ticket? ""Failure to care about the environment"" Oh Goddammit, did you do this, Gerald?!"
301,10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. I'm just, you know, trying to make people more aware ya' know, it's a-"
302,10,2,Randy,"You got some nerve, you know that?! Where do you come off ticketing people?!"
303,10,2,Gerald,"Well, Randy, calm down. It's not a real ticket."
304,10,2,Randy,I know it's not a real ticket!!
305,10,2,Jimbo Kern,"[approaches] Broflovski, did you put this crap on my windshield?! [Randy crosses his arms]"
306,10,2,Gerald,"Jimbo, your truck probably gets less than ten miles to the gallon."
307,10,2,Jimbo Kern,"[crumples the ticket into a wad and throws it down] Well thanks, Officer Dickhole!"
308,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dad, let's just go!"
309,10,2,Gerald,"Look, I'm just trying to make the people of South Park aware of a very serious problem."
310,10,2,Randy,"The problem, Gerald, is that ever since you got a hybrid car, you've gotten so smug that you love the smell of your own farts!"
311,10,2,Gerald,"Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't think it was ""high and mighty"" to [closes his eyes] care about the earth!"
312,10,2,Randy,And that too! Stop talking with your eyes closed! That's what smug people do!
313,10,2,Gerald,"Well, I really don't see how [closes his eyes] that has anything to do with the-"
314,10,2,Randy,"There, like that! Stop that!"
315,10,2,Darryl Weathers,Who the hell put this faggy fake ticket on my truck!
316,10,2,Gerald,"All right, that does it! Come on, Kyle, I don't want you hanging around with these ignorant idiots! [they walk away, and Ike bounces along]"
317,10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. Yeah, I think it's best we just do it right away."
318,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks into the kitchen with Ike] Dad. [his parents turn to face him] Dad, Ike and I have been talking, and well, we feel that your new car is changing you."
319,10,2,Gerald,"[closes his eyes] Yes, it certainly is."
320,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,We're thinking that a lot of people in town starting too... [rolls his eyes]
321,10,2,Ike,Take offense.
322,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,...a-are starting to take offense at your actions. We feel like you're starting to become-hmm... [rolls his eyes again and cues Ike]
323,10,2,Ike,[slowly] Alienated.
324,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,...star-starting to become alienated from some of your friends.
325,10,2,Gerald,"Well, I totally agree, Kyle."
326,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,You do??
327,10,2,Gerald,Yes. A lot of people in town just aren't ready to drive hybrid cars.
328,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Righ! [grins] Okay, good."
329,10,2,Gerald,"And that's why, [hugs Sheila by the shoulder] I've talked it over with your mother, and [releases the hug] ...we've decided to MOVE!"
330,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,What??
331,10,2,Gerald,"We need to be where everyone is motivated and progressive like us! Start getting your things packed, boys! The Broflovksi family is moving to San Francisco! [grins. Kyle and Ike look stunned]"
332,10,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah? [the door opens and Butters enters]
333,10,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh hay, Stan. Uh you should come on over. Uh they're havin' a goin'-away party for Kyle."
334,10,2,Stan Marsh,Going away party? What do you mean?
335,10,2,Butters Stotch,Well don't you know? Kyle's movin' away.
336,10,2,Stan Marsh,[jumps off his chair and looks at Butters] Moving away?? Kyle can't move away!
337,10,2,Butters Stotch,Well he is.
338,10,2,Stan Marsh,Where's the going-away party?
339,10,2,Butters Stotch,At Cartman's house.
340,10,2,Eric Cartman,[walks into the living room with a pitcher and cups of pop] Hey everybody! There's more pop in the refrigerator. Let's make this the best going-away party EVER! [blows into a noisemaker and makes it stick out. Other kids walk up and take cups away]
341,10,2,Token Black,"Hey Eric, where's Kyle?"
342,10,2,Eric Cartman,Who? [smiles innocently]
343,10,2,Clyde,"Kyle, the person leaving."
344,10,2,Eric Cartman,Kyle? Why would I invite Kyle?
345,10,2,Craig Tucker,"Dude, a going-away party is supposed to be for the person who is going away!"
346,10,2,Stan Marsh,[enters the house and the other boys move a bit] Kyle? Kyle!
347,10,2,Clyde,Kyle's not here. Cartman didn't invite him.
348,10,2,Stan Marsh,What?!
349,10,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys, this is our party. That no-good back-stabbing Jew rat is finally leaving! Come on, everyone! Let's sing! [Stan leaves]'Nanana na! Nanana na! Hey hey hey! Goodbye Kyle!"
350,10,2,Stan Marsh,Kyle! Du-what is going on?!
351,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,My Dad says he can't live here anymore.
352,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Broflovski, please. Kyle's my best friend."
353,10,2,Gerald,"I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs."
354,10,2,Stan Marsh,Well... Maybe they'll change.
355,10,2,Gerald,"[puts a small box into the trunk] I wouldn't count on it. Come on, boys, get in the car! [Kyle and Ike head towards it]"
356,10,2,Stan Marsh,Nooo!
357,10,2,Gerald,"[opens the back right door, and the boys climb in] Maybe you can make a difference, Stan. [closes the door] Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars. Until that day, [walks around to the driver's side] we're just gonna have to be [closes his eyes] with our own kind. [gets in and begins to drive away. Stan steps into the street and watches them go]"
358,10,2,Stan Marsh,I will. I will get everyone to drive hybrid cars! I swear it!
359,10,2,Gerald,"Well? What do you think, huh? [the boxes are present, but as yet unpacked]"
360,10,2,Sheila,"Oh Gerald, it's beautiful."
361,10,2,Gerald,"Yeah. Now THIS, is a house. [some neighbors stop in]"
362,10,2,San Francisco Man,"Oh hello there, you must be the new neighbors."
363,10,2,Gerald,Yes that's right. We're the Broflovskis.
364,10,2,San Francisco Man,"Welcome to San Francisco. I'm Peter Thompson. This is my wife, Nancy Jarvis, and our son, Brian Thompson-Jarvis [sucking on something purple] So how do you like the neighborhood?"
365,10,2,Sheila,Oh it's gorgeous. These old houses are so neat.
366,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis","Yes, well, unlike most cities, in San Francisco we try to [closes his eyes] keep all the historic houses instead of knocking them down."
367,10,2,Man 2,"[approaches the front entrance] You in here, Peter?"
368,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis","Oh hay, Paul. Come on in and meet the Broflovskis"
369,10,2,"Paul McDonahue, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan","Hello there. I'm Paul McDonahue. This is my wife, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and our daughter, Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan"
370,10,2,Gerald and Sheila,Hello.
371,10,2,"Paul McDonahue, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan","We noticed your hybrid out front - that's a V series, right?"
372,10,2,Gerald,Yeah. That's right.
373,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis","Whoa, nice car, but we're gonna have to get you into the BT series [closes his eyes] Its emissions are actually cleaner."
374,10,2,Gerald,"Wow, so, everyone here drives a hybrid, huh?"
375,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis","Oh, of course. We're a little more progressive and ahead of the curve here in San Francisco. [farts, then bends over to take it all in, then stands up again] Ahhhm. [licks his lips to savor every last bit of fart] Anyway, I'm sure you'll find it much better here."
376,10,2,"Paul McDonahue, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan","Yes, you'll find that San Francisco is pretty much more open-minded and grown-up than the Midwest. [farts, then bends over to take it all in as if it were oxygen] Ahhh, [sniff] ahh, [sniff] ahh. [stands up] We're just a little bit more protective of our environment here in San Francisco"
377,10,2,Gerald,Yeah. We sure are.
378,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, people. Come on, people now. [Cartman and Butters enter]"
379,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing?"
380,10,2,Stan Marsh,"I'm writing a song about the importance of hybrid cars, so maybe people will change their ways."
381,10,2,Eric Cartman,"THAT's gay, heh."
382,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Well if I have any chance of getting Kyle back, I have to get people to stop driving SUVs!"
383,10,2,Eric Cartman,Why do you want Kyle back?? Don't you see how awesome it is without him?
384,10,2,Stan Marsh,"You know, Cartman, you may be stoked now, but I bet you're gonna find that withuot Kyle around to rip on, your life is empty, and hollow."
385,10,2,Eric Cartman,"[fears that for a moment, then] Psh! Whatever dude. I don't need Kyle to rip on, I've got Butters. Come on, Butters, you stupid Jew! [walks out]"
386,10,2,Butters Stotch,Yeah! I'm a dumb Jew. [walks out after Cartman. Stan resumes composing]
387,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, people. Come on, people now."
388,10,2,KXUV DJ,"All right, all you dreamers and creamers out there out there in South Park, I'm gonna play a song by a local artist that really made me think about my impact on the earth. This is Stan Marsh with ""Hey, People, You've Gotta Drive Hybrids Already"". [Stan's intro begins to play]"
389,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on now, people now people now'
People now, come on now, people now
Got to drive hybrids, people now
People now, people now, people now
Hybrids are for people now, people now
Group of people driving people now
Get a hybrid, be good people now."
390,10,2,Customer,He's right. [people leave their cars and go to a Toyonda hybrid dealership]
391,10,2,Stan Marsh,"We have all got to be people now
People-driving-hybrid people now
People now, people now, hybrid now
Hybrid-people-driving people now.
Come on, people, let's be people now
Hybrid-people-driving people now
Come on, everybody be people now"
392,10,2,Mrs Tucker Craig s Mother,"Hey Jimbo, you got a hybrid too?"
393,10,2,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, I just wanted to [closes his eyes] try to set an example, you know?"
394,10,2,Mrs Tucker Craig s Mother,"Yeah, I guess it's up to us to [closes her eyes] show everyone the way.[opens them] Good for you!"
395,10,2,Jimbo Kern,[cheerfully closes his eyes] Thanks. [drives off]
396,10,2,Mrs Garrison,Can you believe some people still don't drive hybrids? [pets her own hybrid]
397,10,2,Randy,"I know! It's like ""Earth to America? Hello? This is simple stuff here. Gawl"""
398,10,2,Mr Mackey,"Well from now on, I'm only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers. Everyone else is just ignorant, m'kay?"
399,10,2,Driver 1,"[eyes closed, thumb up] Good for you!"
400,10,2,Driver 2,"[eyes closed, thumb up] Thanks!"
401,10,2,Randy,"[eyes closed, thumb up] At least we're smart enough to know better!"
402,10,2,Driver 3,"[leans out and looks back, eyes closed, thumb up] Thanks! [the street is now filled with hybrids]"
403,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on, everybody be people now"
404,10,2,Speaker,And so we are here to honor Stan Marsh for making South Park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country! [the crowd cheers]
405,10,2,Richard Tweek,If only the rest of the country [closes his eyes] was as insightful as we are.
406,10,2,Stan Marsh,"[steps up and holds his trophy] Ah, thanks. I was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so... if you don't mind, I'm gonna try to get a hold of him now. [steps down and walks off the stage. The crowd cheers]"
407,10,2,Jimbo Kern,Great speech!
408,10,2,Gerald,"Yeah, well, you know my son is just [closes his eyes] a little bit more clever than some."
409,10,2,An officer,"[stops Stan as Stan steps onto solid ground] Hello there, I'm Ranger McFriendly. I'm the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of South Park. You must be the little boy who wrote that song."
410,10,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
411,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,Uhh! [smacks Stan on the left cheek enough to spin his head around]
412,10,2,Stan Marsh,Ow!
413,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,You son of a bitch! Do you have any idea what you've done?!
414,10,2,Stan Marsh,What?!
415,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,Come with me! [walks off. Stan follows]
416,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,There! Look! [a dark brown cloud is showing hovering over the town]
417,10,2,Stan Marsh,Smog? There's never been smog over South Park before.
418,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Don't you get it?! When people drive hybrid cars, they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air! That isn't smog, it's smug!"
419,10,2,Stan Marsh,Smug?
420,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Hybrid cars make better for emission levels, but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug. You can have smug in the atmosphere, and you know what that leads to? Glodal laming! Thanks to your gay little song, South Park is now the second smuggiest city in America!"
421,10,2,Announcer,This is a South Park News Weather Bulletin!
422,10,2,Anchor Tom,It looks like we have a smug alert here in South Park. Our own Keenan Williams has the details. Keenan?
423,10,2,Keenan Williams,"[at the weather desk] Thanks, Tom, a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning. [a map of Denver and surrounding areas] All those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of Park and Jefferson Counties. On the national map, we can see smug over Denver and developing smug in Los Angeles. However, San Francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country."
424,10,2,Singer,A smuggy day in San Francisco town.
425,10,2,"Paul McDonahue, Paulie Beaumont-McCallahan, and Mindy McDonahue-Beaumont-McCallahan","Sheila, did you meet Gail and Brian?"
426,10,2,Sheila,"No! Hello, how are you?"
427,10,2,Gail And Brian,"Really good, really good. [she farts and quickly bends over to inhale it all]"
428,10,2,Gerald,"Hey there. Alan, right?"
429,10,2,Alan,"Actually, it's Alain"
430,10,2,Gerald,"Right right, w-would, would you like red or white wine?"
431,10,2,Alan,Can I just get an empty glass?
432,10,2,Gerald,Oh. Sure. [hands him an empty glass]
433,10,2,Alan,"Can you believe all these imbeciles in Texas? They just put another prisoner to death. [puts the glass to his ass and farts into it, then lifts the glass to his nose and inhales deeply]"
434,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,[hesitant at first] So... what do you do for fun?
435,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis",We drink and take drugs.
436,10,2,Boy 1,Do you want some acid?
437,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, no thanks. We don't do that stuff."
438,10,2,Boy 2,You will. There's a reason most San Francisco kids take a lot of drugs.
439,10,2,"Peter Thompson, Nancy Jarvis, and Brian Thompson-Jarvis",It's the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time.
440,10,2,Gerald,"Everything okay in here, Kyle?"
441,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, fine, Dad."
442,10,2,Gerald,"So much better here with the intellectuals, isn't it, boys? [farts, then bends over and inhales his own fart] Wuhh [sniffs, rises and walks away] Mmmm."
443,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,Well... maybe I'll take just half a hit of acid.
444,10,2,Ike,I want three.
445,10,2,Stan Marsh,"No, no, I'm asking if there's a listing for Broflovski in San Francisco! They just moved there!"
446,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Haha! Take that, Jew boy! I guess you Heebs can't even play video football!"
447,10,2,Butters Stotch,"[giggles] Yeah. You're right. [Cartman stops for a few seconds, then drops his controller]"
448,10,2,Eric Cartman,"You know Butters, you make for a lousy Jew."
449,10,2,Butters Stotch,"Well I'm sorry. Well it's just that I'm not Jewish, and now th-"
450,10,2,Eric Cartman,"No, no! Don't apologize, you asshole!"
451,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,[barging in] Marsh!
452,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh crap, Ranger McFriendly."
453,10,2,Eric Cartman,Who?
454,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,You'd better come with me to the news station! Our situation just got a lot worse!
455,10,2,Keenan Williams,"I noticed it on the computer this morning. Look here. [a satellite map is shown, with a closeup window over it. There's smug everywhere] This is the smug over South Park. It's... getting bigger and gaining strength."
456,10,2,Eric Cartman,[clearly doesn't know what's happening] The smug?
457,10,2,Keenan Williams,"The smug is getting so massive that it's moving west... and fusing with the San Francisco smug... Here. [points to the smug over the California-Nevada border, near Reno] These two smug clouds are combining, fueling each other. [moves his hand over the hurricane-like formation over the Nevada-Utah border] Now take a look at this. [moves his hand towards Southern California. A small cell is moving northward]"
458,10,2,Stan Marsh,What is that?
459,10,2,Keenan Williams,It's the smug from George Clooney's acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.
460,10,2,Stan Marsh,George Clooney's acceptance speech?
461,10,2,Keenan Williams,"Did you hear it? He talked about how people in Hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes. He even took credit for the Civil Rights movement -Look!! The point is... the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it... and is headed straight for the super cell. The South Park and San Francisco smug is already at critical mass. If it gets hit by George Clooney's acceptance speech, it will be a disaster of epic proportions. The perfect storm... of self-satisfaction."
462,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,We've got to tell the townspeople! South Park still has a chance to make it through the storm!
463,10,2,Stan Marsh,What about San Francisco?
464,10,2,Keenan Williams,"[with gravity] Kid, thanks to your gay little song, there's not gonna be a San Francisco."
465,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Soo, that's it people. [a different map showing the various smugs is shown, with an arrow going from Clooney's smug to the center of the super cell] When the smug from George Clooney's speech hits the San Francisco and South Park smug, we're gonna witness a storm the likes of which we've never seen."
466,10,2,Randy,Are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all?
467,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"If the smug clouds remain the way they are, yes. [the crowd grasps, then people begin talking about it]"
468,10,2,Jimbo Kern,This is all Stan's fault! He wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids!
469,10,2,Randy,"Yeah. Good going, stupid!"
470,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Listen! Though we all agree this is Stan's fault, there is still something we can do. If we all work together to reduce smugness, we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm, at least here in our own town."
471,10,2,Stephen,Then that's it. There's only one way to reduce smugness. We've gotta destroy every hybrid car in town! [the crowd responds vigorously to the plan]
472,10,2,Jimbo Kern,Everyone get your hybrid and meet at Dawson's! [Stan turns left and walks away]
473,10,2,Randy,"Hey, where do you think YOU're going?!"
474,10,2,Stan Marsh,[stops and turns to face the crowd] I'm gonna try and warn Kyle to get out of San Francisco.
475,10,2,Randy,Oh no you're not! Your gay little song got us to drive hybrids; you're gonna help us get rid of 'em!
476,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,How long do we have until the smug clouds collide?
477,10,2,Keenan Williams,Not long. The smug from George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech has already crossed into Arizona.
478,10,2,Attendant,"The hell is that? [The cloud goes over the station. As it goes over, clips of George Clooney's Academy Awards Acceptance Speech issue from within, ending with ""Oscar winner, George Clooney, sexiest man alive""]"
479,10,2,Butters Stotch,"Wow, Eric. You sure are a great guy for doing this."
480,10,2,Eric Cartman,[puts on the gloves] I don't have a choice. Somebody has to get into San Francisco and warn Kyle's family to get out before the storm hits.
481,10,2,Butters Stotch,But... how come we can't just take the bus on into the city?
482,10,2,Eric Cartman,"You don't know San Francisco, Butters. [zips the suit up] It was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s. Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old. [turns around and sighs] I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me. [reaches down, picks up the helmet, and puts it on, locks it in place, and pressurizes the suit. Communication resumes through the intercom] All right, Butters, I'll be tethered to you through this cord. It's my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength."
483,10,2,Butters Stotch,"[adjusts his headset] I will. You're really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric."
484,10,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm not doin' it for Kyle. [turns around] I can't believe I'm actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. [begins to walk slowly and deliberately into the city]"
485,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!"
486,10,2,Stan Marsh,Can't somebody else operate this? I can't really reach.
487,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Well then you shouldn't have written that gay little song, shouldn't you have?! [The green hybrid is now over the masher, and Stan releases it. Moments later, a cube of twisted green metal slides out and drops onto the ground] Keenan, we've gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!"
488,10,2,Keenan Williams,"They're dropping, slowly, but... but we're running out of time!"
489,10,2,San Francisco Man,"Yeah, it's like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan."
490,10,2,Eric Cartman,"[checking in] Butters, are you there?!"
491,10,2,Butters Stotch,"[making sure the cord is taut] I'm here, Eric."
492,10,2,Eric Cartman,I've started to enter the smug. I'm about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?
493,10,2,Butters Stotch,[now reading a map] You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?
494,10,2,Eric Cartman,Yes. It's just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.
495,10,2,Butters Stotch,"Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You've got to start heading west."
496,10,2,Eric Cartman,Turning right at O two four niner. [turns right at the corner and continues walking]
497,10,2,Randy,That's it. That's that the last one.
498,10,2,Ranger McFriendly,"Keenan? Keenan, we've smashed the last hybrid!"
499,10,2,Keenan Williams,"Harry, the smug from Clooney's speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside! [the townsfolk hear the warning and run around all over the place. Keenan says softly, deeply] God help us."
500,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters?! Butters, I think I'm here! 2419 Castillo?!"
501,10,2,Butters Stotch,"That's it! Eric, hurry! Somethin's goin' on out here!"
502,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!"
503,10,2,Gerald,"[Slowly, blissfully] Being smug is a good thing. [farts in his armchair, bends down to inhale it]"
504,10,2,Eric Cartman,Oh my CHRIST! [runs up to Kyle's room and kicks the door open. Kyle and Ike are as wasted as Gerald and Sheila are. They sit on the floor with their backs against Ike's bed] Kyle? Kyle!
505,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"The acid. Dude, I'm totally tripping balls."
506,10,2,Ike,I'm totally tripping balls. I'm totally tripping balls.
507,10,2,Eric Cartman,"[trying to shake Kyle to his senses] We have to get out of here! Now! [lightning strikes the house, which begins to burn. The lights begin to flicker, and the camera zooms in on Cartman, who continues shaking Kyle] Kyle! Kyle!! [the screen goes black]"
508,10,2,Network Anchor,"And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night's smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I'm afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole."
509,10,2,Stan Marsh,No...
510,10,2,Randy,"I'm sorry, Stan. I'm sorry your gay little song killed your friend."
511,10,2,Clyde,"Hey! Hey, Stan! You're not gonna believe it! You've gotta come see!"
512,10,2,Stan Marsh,What?
513,10,2,Clyde,It's a miracle!
514,10,2,Stan Marsh,Kyle!
515,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,Hey Stan.
516,10,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what happened?? [grins]"
517,10,2,Gerald,We don't know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.
518,10,2,Mr Mackey,"It's like you had a guardian angel, m'kay? [Butters looks to Cartman for any reaction. Cartman puts his left index finger to his mouth, indicating that Butters should keep his mouth shut about this]"
519,10,2,Stan Marsh,"[gives Kyle a brief hug] Dude, I'm so glad you're not dead."
520,10,2,Richard Tweek,So I guess there's nothing left to do now but... rebuild.
521,10,2,Randy,"Yeah. First off, we're all gonna need new cars."
522,10,2,Gerald,"And let's make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? [everyone seems to agree and discusses it...]"
523,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,NO! Hybrid cars are a good thing!
524,10,2,Mr Mackey,"But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m'kay?"
525,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hybrid cars don't cause smugness, people do. [silent reactions all around] Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it."
526,10,2,Randy,You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we're better than everyone else because of it.
527,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
528,10,2,Randy,I'm... [puts his hands over his lower belly] I'm not ready...
529,10,2,Gerald,I don't think I can do it either.
530,10,2,Mr Mackey,It's simply asking too much.
531,10,2,Randy,"Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us."
532,10,2,Gerald,"Come on, everybody! Let's go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! [everyone likes the idea; they all disperse]"
533,10,2,Eric Cartman,"[walks up to Kyle] Well, looks like you're back for good, huh Kyle?"
534,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I guess so."
535,10,2,Eric Cartman,"We just can't get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!"
536,10,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't belittle my people, you fucking fatass! [turns and walks away angry]"
537,10,2,Eric Cartman,"Ah, that's better. [smiles]"
538,10,3,Sharon,"But the Bubble Gum Prince wasn't afraid. He knew that the Land of Chocolate was safe forever and ever. [Stan's eyelids shut themselves and his left arm falls a bit. He's asleep. Sharon rises from the bed and bends down.] Goodnight my little angel. [kisses him on the forehead, turns out the lamp and closes the door on her way out. Moments later, the door flies off its hinges and a frantic Randy runs in with two large plastic water bottles]"
539,10,3,Randy,STAAAN!!
540,10,3,Stan,[awakens and looks around as the lights come on] What?? What??
541,10,3,Randy,"Get up! Get your shoes on! Gotta get out of here! MOOVE! [brings the shoes over, but yanks Stan along before Stan has a chance to put them on. As they go down the hall, Randy stops to get a vase and toss the flowers out.] Take this!! [hands the vase to Stan] We've gotta bring all the water we can!! [Shelly opens her door and steps out] Shelly, go get my gun!!"
542,10,3,Shelly,Whats going on dad?
543,10,3,Randy,JUST GET THE GUN!! [runs down the hall and down the stairs. Sharon comes out of the master bedroom running while putting her coat on.]
544,10,3,Randy,"Unh, come on! [the camera switches to a wider view and shows everyone running around with all manner of items in hand. A man carrying a large first-aid kit trips and moans in pain]"
545,10,3,Man,AWWWGH!
546,10,3,Woman,Oh nooo! [Stan sees Kyle in the crowd with his family]
547,10,3,Stan,Kyle! What the hell is going on this time?!
548,10,3,Kyle,I have no idea!
549,10,3,Man,Take cover in the community center again!
550,10,3,Jimbo,"All right, everyone get in and get a seal on that door!"
551,10,3,Linda,"Oh my God, Stephen, we've left Butters. [moves to find him. Stephen stops her]"
552,10,3,Stephen,"We can't go back out, Linda! It's too late for him!"
553,10,3,Stan,"Dad? [Randy is cutting duct tape into several equal-length strips] Dad, what the hell is going on?! [Randy stands up and faces the boys. Behind him, Mr. Mackey and a man in a raincoat set up a TV]"
554,10,3,Randy,A cartoon...! A cartoon is about to air on American television with... with the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a character! [Stan and Kyle look at each other and blink]
555,10,3,Stan,Sso?
556,10,3,Randy,"SO?! Stanley, Mohammad is sacred to the Muslim people. [people around them begin to pay attention] Ever since those cartoon in Denmark, the rules have changed. Nobody shows an image of Mohammad anymore."
557,10,3,Gerald,[approaching in his pajamas] Which cartoon is it? What cartoon'll be so insensitive as to have Mohammad as a character?
558,10,3,Randy,Who do you think?! The cartoon that's always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor! Family Guy!
559,10,3,Crowd,AWWW!
560,10,3,Jimbo,How could Family Guy do that?
561,10,3,Sheila,Why would Family Guy so blatantly insult Muslims?
562,10,3,Randy,Because Family Guy doesn't care who they insult! They only care about their... precious money!
563,10,3,Stan,"Oh come on, people. You really think anybody's gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon??"
564,10,3,Mr Mackey,Wu-we've got the TV working! [the picture comes into focus]
565,10,3,News 4 Anchor Tom,"Once again, a cartoon depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad is set to air tonight on Family Guy!"
566,10,3,Sharon,"Oh Randy, hold me. [Randy holds her]"
567,10,3,News 4 Anchor Tom,"The news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the Muslim world. [Live footage is show - a crowd holds an American flag aloft and someone sets it on fire] All over the Middle East, Muslims are burning American flags and Family Guy posters. Muslim terrorist al-Zawahri made this statement:"
568,10,3,al Zawahri,"[translated] We are so super pissed off at 'Family Guy'. 'Family Guy' isn't even that funny of a show. A jihad on 'Family Guy', and the 'Family Guy' nation!"
569,10,3,Linda,So what happens now?
570,10,3,Randy,"We stay here through the night, wait it out to see if they do anything. If we're still alive in the morning, [dramatic closeup] then we'll know we're not dead."
571,10,3,Mrs Garrison,It's okay! [everyone heads out]
572,10,3,Randy,We're alive?? We're alive! [pumps his fists]
573,10,3,Jimbo,"[listening in on a boombox] Everyone. Everyone, listen. FOX Network censored the image of Mohammad at the last minute."
574,10,3,Crowd,Oh thank God.
575,10,3,Randy,"Well, it looks like we've dodged a bullet."
576,10,3,Stan,They censored the image of Mohammad? How?
577,10,3,Kyle,I TIVO every episode. We can go to my house and see what they did.
578,10,3,Kyle,"Okay you guys, check it out. [begins scanning the recorded programming]"
579,10,3,Cartman,You TIVO every episode of Family Guy?
580,10,3,Kyle,"Dude, it's a good show."
581,10,3,Stan,"Yeah, lots of people like Family Guy."
582,10,3,Cartman,"Yich. [Kyle has reached his target. The Family Guy living room is shown. Peter is in his armchair, the rest of the family is on the sofa]"
583,10,3,Lois,"Peter, I can't believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner."
584,10,3,Peter,You think that's bad? Remember when I auditioned to be David Hasselhoff's car? [flashback #1]
585,10,3,Peter,"Hey there, Knight Rider. [Michael Knight climbs onto Peter's shoulders and they're off]"
586,10,3,Michael,"After those bad guys, KITT! [Peter smiles and his teeth glow like KITT's headlights used to]"
587,10,3,Chris,"Yeah, but Dad, why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner?"
588,10,3,Stewie,Perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous.
589,10,3,Peter,Nervous? Like when I had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain? [flashback #2]
590,10,3,Peter,"[rings a doorbell. The captain answers, dressed as Capt. Kirk] Pancakes for you, Captain?"
591,10,3,Soccer Captain,"I'll be the Captain, and you'll be Tenille. [rushes away and returns with a wig and pale blue dress for Peter to don. Moments later the captain is at a keyboard on the front lawn playing a Captain and Tenille tune as Peter sings]"
592,10,3,Peter,Love will keep us together
593,10,3,Kyle,"Hehaha, heh."
594,10,3,Cartman,Yich.
595,10,3,Lois,"But Peter, I don't wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend."
596,10,3,Peter,"Well, maybe we can just have tea."
597,10,3,Brian,"You mean like the time you had tea with Mohammad, the prophet of the Muslim faith? [flashback #3]"
598,10,3,Peter,"Come on, Mohammad, let's get some tea. [Mohammad is covered by a black box with the words ""IMAGE CENSORED BY FOX"" printed several times from top to bottom inside the box. They stop at a tea stand.]"
599,10,3,Mr T,"Try my ""Mr. T. ...tea."" [squints]"
600,10,3,Peter,"Oh boy, was that ever weird. Anyway, I can't believe I invited my old sweetheart to dinner. Huh."
601,10,3,Kyle,That's it? That's all they did?
602,10,3,Cartman,"Oh man, that's not cool! Seriously, that is not cool."
603,10,3,Stan,What? What's the big deal?
604,10,3,Cartman,"What's the big deal? You guys, they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people. [Stan and Kyle look at each other in silence] What, you guys think that's okay?! Do you care at all about people's feelings?!"
605,10,3,Kyle,"Since when you care about being sensitive to people's religion, Cartman?!"
606,10,3,Stan,"Yeah, you rip on people's religion all the time!"
607,10,3,Cartman,"That's different! I'm just a little boy! That's a cartoon! Millions of people watch it! How would you feel, Kyle, if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of Jews all the time?! Huh?!"
608,10,3,Kyle,Uhhh...
609,10,3,Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, it's wrong! It's WRONG!! [turns and heads for the front door, then turns back and aims his index fingers at the other boys] It's wrong! [opens the door, heads out, and closes it behind him. Kyle's parents walk in from the kitchen with their survival gear]"
610,10,3,Sheila,"Kyle? Kyle, what are you watchi-?!"
611,10,3,Peter,"Hey Brian, this is like the time I got a job as a carrot cake."
612,10,3,Sheila,"Gaaah! It's Family Guy! Quick, Gerald, do something! [Gerald arrives with a bat and begins bashing the television set to bits]"
613,10,3,Kyle,"Dad, Dad, Jesus Christ!"
614,10,3,Gerald,[stops once the picture is gone] It's okay... it's dead.
615,10,3,Sheila,You boys know you're not supposed to watch that careless show!
616,10,3,Kyle,"Mom, it was nothing. Mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea."
617,10,3,Sheila,You boys don't understand anything! It's obvious that you ALL need Muslim-sensitivity training!
618,10,3,Mrs Garrison,"Welcome to Muslim-Sensitivity Training. It is important for us to understand why the Muslim feel the way they do, and why we can never show an image of Mohammad."
619,10,3,Kyle,"No, Muslims can't show an image of Mohammad."
620,10,3,Mrs Garrison,"Kyle, you're not being very sensitive."
621,10,3,Cartman,"Yeah, Kyle. Maybe you think this is funny, but the rest of us don't."
622,10,3,Mrs Garrison,"Let's all look at why Muslims are upset: [turns and picks up a stick of chalk] First of all, in the Muslim religion, you're not allowed to have what? [no response] Sex. Good. [writes ""NO SEX"" on the board] There's no sex until marriage in the Muslim world. [faces the class] Now, this would be fine except that in the Muslim religion you also can't... Anybody? [no response] Jack off. [writes ""NO JACKING OFF"" on the board] Okay, jacking it is strictly forbidden in the Muslim religion. [faces the class] And what do we know about the places Muslims live? They live in? [no response] Good, sand. [writes ""SAND"" on the board] Now put yourself in the shoes of a Muslim. It's Friday night, but you can't have sex, and you can't jack off. There's sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass, and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid, and mocks your prophet. Well you know what? I'd be pretty pissed off too!"
623,10,3,Cartman,"Mrs. Garrison, that is ignorant and racist! Muslims are mad because of Family Guy, not because they can't jack off! Right, Wendy?"
624,10,3,Wendy,[skeptically] ...yeah.
625,10,3,Mr Mackey,[over the school PA system] Attention students: Proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement!
626,10,3,Stan,The hell's going on now?!
627,10,3,Principal Victoria,"Shh! Quiet, students, quiet!"
628,10,3,SNN Anchor,"Once again: we have just learned that the Family Guy episode featuring Mohammad was only Part 1 of a two-parter! And Part 2 is going to air next week, with Mohammad uncensored!"
629,10,3,Cartman,What?
630,10,3,Mrs Garrison,Why would they-?
631,10,3,SNN Anchor,FOX Studios claims that the Family Guy writing staff has demanded the Mohammad character be seen in full view. [a shot of some townsmen watching the news at the bar] The head of FOX had this to say:
632,10,3,FOX President and other executives,"Family Guy is our biggest show. If they insist we don't censor their work, then we we can't."
633,10,3,Randy,[angrily leaves his bar stool] FAMILY GUY!!! [throws his Corona bottle down; it shatters] I DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!
634,10,3,SNN Anchor,"Once again, bitter riots have started in the Middle East; this time, even more massive. And terrorist leader al-Zawahri has issued a threat"
635,10,3,al Zawahri,"[translated] Seriously, 'Family Guy' isn't even that well written. The jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot. When this episode airs-our retaliation will be MASSIVE!!!!"
636,10,3,Mr Mackey,Retaliation... Oh my God. M'kay?
637,10,3,Cartman,Goddamned Family Guy! Now they're just provoking people! It's like they want a holy war!
638,10,3,Stan,Does this mean we don't have school all week?
639,10,3,Cartman,"You guys, this is serious! We have to do something!"
640,10,3,Kenny,(Like what?)
641,10,3,Cartman,We have to go to the FOX network in L.A. We have to go and... try to get that episode pulled. You guys with me?
642,10,3,Stan,"Dude, we can't go anywhere. They've shut down the airports and the buses."
643,10,3,Cartman,Then we'll ride our Big Wheels.
644,10,3,Stan,To Los Angeles?
645,10,3,Cartman,"If that's what it takes, yes! We have to talk to the network! The Family Guy writers aren't gonna back down!"
646,10,3,Kyle,Well good for them. They shouldn't! The writers are standing up and saying they aren't going to be intimidated!
647,10,3,Cartman,"Intimidated?! Is that what you think this is about, Kyle?"
648,10,3,Kyle,"All right dude, what the hell has gotten into you?! I don't trust for one second that your sudden concern for the Muslim people is real!"
649,10,3,Cartman,"All right, fine, Kyle. Forget the Muslim faith for a minute. People can get hurt. If ten people die because Family Guy just had to have their little joke, will you still think it's funny? [Kyle stifles an answer] What if a hundred people died? Will it be funny then, Kyle? [Kyle's jaw drops] I'm going to Los Angeles. I'm gonna do whatever I can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand. Somebody has to speak for the Muslim people. Somebody has to speak for what's right. [walks off]"
650,10,3,Gerald,"Kyle! Kyle, wake up! [Sheila and Ike follow him in] We have to go! The terrorists are attacking!"
651,10,3,Kyle,Dad? Are you sure there's time?
652,10,3,Gerald,"This isn't a joke, Kyle! Bombs have already gone off in six cities!"
653,10,3,Kyle,No!
654,10,3,Sheila,Wait a minute! [looks around and drops her stuff] Where's Ike?!
655,10,3,Gerald,[looks around and drops his stuff] He was just here! Ike!
656,10,3,Sheila,Ike! [Kyle goes back through the crowd to look for him]
657,10,3,Kyle,Ike? Iiike! [sees him] Ike! [Ike is headed for the Ice Cream shop]
658,10,3,Ike,Ice cream. I want chocolate.
659,10,3,Kyle,"Ike! [points left] This way! [a flash of light fills the night, and Kyle shields his eyes from it. A bomb has gone off behind the ice cream shop and the shockwaves spread out, obliterating the row of stores before Ike.] Iiike! [races towards him. Ike is engulfed by the flames, flesh turning to bone]"
660,10,3,Ike,[hauntingly] Kyyyle!
661,10,3,Kyle,"[as his flesh is consumed by the flames] Nooooo! [sits upright in his bed and is quite away now. He catches his breath, then leaves his bed to check on Ike. He opens Ike's door and looks in. Ike is sound asleep under his mobile. Kyle lets out a soft sigh of relief]"
662,10,3,Cartman,"Come to try and stop me?! [...a bigger box of Cheesy Poofs...] It isn't gonna work. [...a can of Dr. Pep-er, a can of lemon-lime soda...]"
663,10,3,Kyle,"I didn't come to stop you. I... I think you're right, Cartman. I want to help you get the Family Guy episode pulled."
664,10,3,Cartman,"[...Snacky Cakes...] Yeah well, I don't need a partner on this. [...another can of Dr. Pep-er...] Especially one who doesn't trust me. [seals his knapsack shut]"
665,10,3,Kyle,"Look, Cartman, I don't know what's gotten into you, but... I I think it's pretty amazing. And I think it's real. You have to understand why I didn't believe you before."
666,10,3,Cartman,"[turns around slowly] Yeah. I do understand, Kyle. I've been doing the wrong things for a long time. Doing things for my own selfish reasons. I just wanna do something right, you know? Just this one time."
667,10,3,Kyle,"It's a long trip, dude. You're gonna need help. We can try and get the episode pulled together."
668,10,3,Cartman,You know we might not even make it into the studio.
669,10,3,Kyle,"I know. But just like you, I feel like I have to try. People can really get hurt, and a joke just isn't worth that."
670,10,3,Cartman,So what made you change your mind?
671,10,3,Kyle,I got some sound advice... from an old friend. [they smile at each other. Cartman turns and hops onto his Big Wheels]
672,10,3,Cartman,"Well Kyle, we'd better get going."
673,10,3,Kyle,"Yeah! [dramatic shots of Cartman getting on his Big Wheels, then of Kyle doing the same]"
674,10,3,Cartman,Are you set?
675,10,3,Kyle,I'm set! Let's do this!
676,10,3,Cartman,"All right, let's roll! [they ride off, slowly]"
677,10,3,Mayor McDaniels,"People! People, quiet, please! [the crowd quiets down] We must not panic!"
678,10,3,Randy,"Well what are we gonna do, Mayor?! Part 2 of the Family Guy episode airs in six days!"
679,10,3,Mayor McDaniels,I believe that Professor Thomas from the University has come up with a solution.
680,10,3,Prof Thomas,"[steps up to the podium] Thank you, Mayor. [everyone sits] Now look, everyone, Muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what Family Guy is going to do... because they've wrongly grouped us together. Our only hope is to make the Muslim extremists know... that we had no part in the Mohammad episode. That even though the episode aired, we didn't watch it, we didn't hear it, and we didn't talk about it."
681,10,3,Jimbo,So how do we do that?
682,10,3,Prof Thomas,"We bury our heads. In sand. [flips a board over to reveal his plan for disavowing any knowledge of the episode] We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them. If we can manage to get every person's head buried deep, deep in sand before the Mohammad episode airs, we could avoid looking like we're responsible for any part of this at all."
683,10,3,Stephen,"No, no, wait a minute, [Mrs. Garrison looks at him] that's ridiculous. [Gerald looks at him] What we need to do is just the opposite. Freedom of speech is at stake here, don't you all see? [makes his way to the board] If anything, we should ALL make cartoons of Mohammad, and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want! Look, people, it's... been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately. For the past few decades we haven't had to risk anything to defend it. But those times are going to come! And one of those times is right now. And if WE... aren't willing to RISK... what we have, then we just believe in free speech, but we don't defend it. [the other people there mull this speech over...]"
684,10,3,Randy,I like the sand idea.
685,10,3,Mr Mackey,"Yeah, me too."
686,10,3,Gerald,Yeah. The sand thing sounds a lot simpler. [everyone else agrees]
687,10,3,Mayor McDaniels,"We're gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand! Let's move, people!"
688,10,3,Kyle,"We got six days to make it to Los Angeles. If we keep our stops to a minimum, we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time."
689,10,3,Cartman,"Yes, and in just a few weeks from now, Family Guy will be off the air forever."
690,10,3,Kyle,[puzzled] Off the air? But... we're just going to try to get the Mohammad episode pulled.
691,10,3,Cartman,"It's simple television economics, Kyle. All it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled. If we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of Muslims, then the Catholics can demand a show they don't like get pulled. And then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled. And so on and so on, until Family Guy is no more! It's exactly what happened to Laverne & Shirley."
692,10,3,Kyle,"[races ahead] Whoa whoa wait a minute! [pulls a hand brake so as to block Cartman, then gets off his Big Wheels] This isn't what I signed up for! I like Family Guy. Why do we have to get it off the air forever?"
693,10,3,Cartman,"Because they made f-fun of Muslims, and and that's wrong."
694,10,3,Kyle,But that doesn't mean it has to go off the air. You should like that show. Your sense of humor is just like Family Guy.
695,10,3,Cartman,"[gets off his Big Wheels, his anger sudden and strong, and walks up to Kyle] Don't you EVER, EVER, compare me to Family Guy! You hear me Kyle??!! Compare me to Family Guy again, and so help me I will kill you where you stand! [turns and goes back to his Big Wheels]"
696,10,3,Kyle,[realizes Cartman's true intent] You unbelievable son of a bitch. You never cared about the Muslim religion. Or the safety of people in America. You just want Family Guy off the air.
697,10,3,Cartman,"Do you have any idea what it's like?! Everywhere I go, ""Hey Cartman, you must like Family Guy, right?"" ""Hey, your sense of humor reminds me of Family Guy, Cartman."" [turns and faces Kyle] I am NOTHING like Family Guy! When I make jokes, they are inherent to a story! Deep, situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a POINT! Not just one interchangeable joke after another!!"
698,10,3,Kyle,What are you talking about?!
699,10,3,Cartman,YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
700,10,3,Kyle,I can't believe I let you scare me into taking your side. You used fear to make me stop believing in free speech.
701,10,3,Cartman,Well... I guess you won't be helping me now. No biggie. I don't NEED you to get the episode pulled! [begins to walk towards his Big Wheels]
702,10,3,Kyle,No! [moves to stop Cartman in his tracks] I am NOT letting you go to that television studio and pretend... to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you don't like off the air!
703,10,3,Cartman,"Well then Kyle, I guess we- ...Oh my God, is that Tim McGraw?"
704,10,3,Kyle,"[turns around to see] What? [Cartman shoves him to the ground from behind and quickly gets on his Big Wheels, and peels away. Kyle gets up] CARTMAN! [gets on his Big Wheels and gives chase.]"
705,10,3,Cartman,"Kyle, stop it!"
706,10,3,Cartman,Holy Crap! [swerves to the right]
707,10,3,Kyle,Ahhh!
708,10,3,State Trooper,"Stay on 'em! [the fishtailing continues, but the patrol car loses control] Jesus, Mary! [the car falls back into the median, flips over backwards, and falls apart. Cartman and Kyle continue on as fast as possible towards the setting sun]"
709,10,3,Prof Thomas,"If you have children, be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own. [the camera pans across as a row of residents already has their heads buried, with snorkels in place for undisturbed breathing. The camera stops at Stan.]"
710,10,3,Stan,"Dad, I don't wanna bury my head in the sand."
711,10,3,Randy,"It's the best say, Stanley. Did you eat your Fruit Roll-Up?"
712,10,3,Stan,Yeah.
713,10,3,Randy,"All right, make sure your snorkel is working. [Stan slips it on] All right, now get your head in the hole."
714,10,3,Stan,"Dad, this is stupid."
715,10,3,Randy,"Stanley, there's no time for your immaturity! Do it! [Stan dips his head into the hole and Randy quickly buries it] All right Sharon, now do me. [gives the thumbs-up sign, puts on the snorkel, and dips his head in the hole. Sharon buries his head]"
716,10,3,Jimbo,"[approaches Prof. Thomas with Mrs. Garrison] Uh Professor, we all just thought of somethin'. If everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left, then who's gonna bury the last person's head?"
717,10,3,Prof Thomas,"Yes. I'm afraid one person is going to have to be last, and... not have his head in the sand."
718,10,3,Farmer,[steps forward through the crowd] I'll do it.
719,10,3,Wife,"[appears and tries to stop him] Dylan, no!"
720,10,3,Prof Thomas,"You realize by not burying your head in sand, you'll appear to be a part of the Family Guy audience."
721,10,3,Dylan and Sarah,"Yes, I know."
722,10,3,Wife,"Dylan, please, you can't!"
723,10,3,Dylan and Sarah,"Somebody has to do it, Sarah. [strokes her hair and face] You run along now and you get your head in the sand. I'll be all right. [she looks at him, then cries uncontrollably into his shoulder. He looks at the professor] You have to understand... I'm all she has. [the other townsfolk look on for a few seconds]"
724,10,3,Mrs Garrison,[to Jimbo] Who are those people?
725,10,3,Kyle,"[begins losing control] No! [his Big Wheels go left and he can't brake] AAAAH! [he jumps off as he nears the edge of a cliff] AAAAH! [the Big Wheels goes over the edge and starts bouncing down the side of the cliff. At the first bounce, a rear wheel comes off. At the second bounce, Kyle's knapsack flies off. The rest bounces a few more times until it reaches the ground below, upside down. The Big Wheels explode. Kyle rises and looks down at the wreckage. He nurses an injured right shoulder]"
726,10,3,Cartman,"Hahahaha! So long, Kyle!"
727,10,3,Kyle,You son of a bitch! I won't let you win! You hear me?!
728,10,3,Cartman,"[riding into the distance] Suck mah balls, Kyle! [Kyle sobs a little, then pounds his left fist into the sand along the side of the highway]"
729,10,3,President Bush,Are you the network president?
730,10,3,FOX President and other executives,"Yes, Mr. President."
731,10,3,President Bush,"We need to discuss this Family Guy episode, Mr. President."
732,10,3,FOX President and other executives,"Mr. President, my hands are tied. The Family Guy writers insist I don't censor Mohammad."
733,10,3,President Bush,"But Mr. President, this is a matter of national security. They must be reasoned with."
734,10,3,FOX President and other executives,"Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. [a close-up of Bush looking perplexed.]"
735,10,3,Announcer,Next week on South Park: The race continues. Cartman reaches the Family Guy Studio and learns the shocking secret behind the Family Guy writing staff.
736,10,3,Cartman,"[...and reaches a slow, undulating glowing light, judging from the reflection coming off him] This... explains everything."
737,10,3,Announcer,"As an entire nation buries its head in sand... [a city is shown with sand everywhere, with heads buried in the sand, snorkels out]"
738,10,3,SNN Anchor,The idea has swept the nation! But where will we find enough sand for everyone?
739,10,3,Announcer,...and the battle between Good and Evil is finally waged...
740,10,3,Cartman,"[he and Kyle fight in a burning studio] Kyle, quit it! Stop it, Kyle!"
741,10,3,Announcer,"Will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored? Will Family Guy be destroyed??? Will television executives fight for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out? Tune in to see Part 2 of Family Guy, next week, on South Park!"
742,10,4,Announcer,Previously on South Park...
743,10,4,SNN Anchor,"The popular cartoon, Family Guy, is going to show the image of Mohammad uncensored!"
744,10,4,Prof Thomas,"If we all bury our heads in sand, [a shot of the townsfolk with their heads in the sand] we can avoid being any part of this."
745,10,4,Cartman,I'm gonna do whatever I can... to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand.
746,10,4,Kyle,You just want Family Guy off the air...
747,10,4,Cartman,"Kyle, stop it!"
748,10,4,Cartman,"So long, Kyle!"
749,10,4,Kyle,You son of a bitch! I won't let you win!
750,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"Mr. President, there's something about the Family Guy writing staff I think you should know. [a close-up of Bush looking perplexed.]"
751,10,4,Announcer,"And now, the thrilling conclusion of... Cartoon Wars... will not be seen tonight! [""Special Presentation""] so that we can bring you this Terrance & Phillip Television Special [tooot! Terrance & Phillip... in... Mystery at the Lazy ""J"" Ranch. Terrance and Phillip are shown catching a blackhat in action]"
752,10,4,Phillip,"Say Terrance, isn't it wonderful having a holiday here at the Lazy ""J"" Ranch?"
753,10,4,Terrance,"It sure is, Phillip. But I do believe this steer I'm riding has the farts. [the horse farts and its tail goes up like a flag. They both laugh. Terrance is still fat]"
754,10,4,Phillip,"Oh, look who's coming! Isn't that Mohammad, the holy prophet of the Muslim religion? [Mohammad, covered with a ""CENSORED BY CBC"" bos, rides up to them]"
755,10,4,Mohammad (Canadian voice),"Hey guys, how's it going?"
756,10,4,Terrance,"Hello Mohammad, we've read all aboat you in the Koran."
757,10,4,Mohammad (Canadian voice),I'm here to investigate a murder.
758,10,4,Terrance,"ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE??!!"
759,10,4,Phillip,You censored out the image of Mohammad in our television special!!
760,10,4,Network President,Ey! You guys know the rules! Nobody can show the image of Mohammad anymore. It's dangerous.
761,10,4,Terrance,But you ruined the whole show!
762,10,4,Network President,"Look, I'm not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network. Let's just forget aboat it, okay guys? [farts and laughs. Terrance and Phillip look hard at him, their arms crossed] Aw, come on guys, give me a break."
763,10,4,Phillip,"We demand you rerun Mystery at the Lazy ""J"" Ranch with Mohammad uncensored!"
764,10,4,Network President,"Ey! I run this network, not you guys! And if you ask me, your show has become so preachy and full of messages that you've forgotten how to be funny! NO Mohammad!"
765,10,4,Terrance,But Family Guy is going to show Mohammad on an episode that airs tonight!
766,10,4,Network President,"I doubt it! I'll bet that right now, somebody is on their way to FOX Network to demand that that episode be pulled."
767,10,4,Cartman,"Ma'am, I need to speak to the president of this network right away."
768,10,4,"Miss Travis, Receptionist",What is it regarding?
769,10,4,Cartman,"It's regarding Family Guy. I demand that the Mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight! It's incendiary, it's offensive to Muslims, and people can get hurt! It's wrong! It's WROOONG!"
770,10,4,"Miss Travis, Receptionist","O...kay, but if you've got a problem with Family Guy, you'll have to wait in line. [points to her right. Cartman looks over and then back at the receptionist] That little boy over there has an appointment to try and get Family Guy off the air altogether. [Cartman walks over and sees Bart Simpson seated in a chair, his skateboard leaning on it]"
771,10,4,Cartman,"Dude, can I go before you?"
772,10,4,Bart Simpson,Eat my shorts!
773,10,4,Kyle,"What the hell is going on? [everyone there has his or her head buried in sand. Kyle walks among them] Hello? [stops next to someone in a red sweater] Excuse me, I need to get to Los Angeles. [tugs at the pants. The person waves. Kyle looks around and goes into the diner] Hello?! [a TV in the store is tuned to SNN]"
774,10,4,SNN Anchor,"...starting in a small town in central Colorado. The idea has now spread all over America. [a helicopter shot of buried heads everywhere] Muslims continue to riot in the Middle East, demanding that Family Guy not air tonight's episode. [more live footage is shown. Kyle gets close to the TV] Amd Muslim terrorists continue to make threats."
775,10,4,Al Zawahri,"[translated text reads] ""Family Guy"" better not show Mohammad tonight. I'm serious. ""Family Guy"" isn't funny."
776,10,4,SNN Anchor,Osama bin Laden had this to say:
777,10,4,Osama bin Laden,"[translated text reads] If you look closely at the writing in ""Family Guy"", you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot, and I think that's totally gay."
778,10,4,SNN Anchor,"Bin Laden went on to say that if Family Guy shows the image of Mohammad as planned, the terrorist retaliation will be immediate. [a rifle appears next to him and a hand cocks it]"
779,10,4,Trucker,[with rifle trained on Kyle] You one of them?
780,10,4,Kyle,Who?
781,10,4,Trucker,How come your head ain't in the sand? [Kyle is confused]
782,10,4,Cartman,"So... you don't like Family Guy either, huh?"
783,10,4,Bart Simpson,I hate Family Guy.
784,10,4,Cartman,So what's your plan? You're gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air?
785,10,4,Bart Simpson,Not nicely.
786,10,4,Cartman,"Look, kid, if you hate a TV show, all you have to do is get an episode pulled. Pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air."
787,10,4,Bart Simpson,"Cool, man."
788,10,4,Cartman,Yes. So my plan is to use this whole Mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonight's show. I'm going to use fear to get them to do what I want.
789,10,4,Bart Simpson,"Isn't that like, terrorism?"
790,10,4,Cartman,"...No, it isn't like terrorism. It IS terrorism."
791,10,4,Bart Simpson,I could do that.
792,10,4,Cartman,This is manipulation at its highest lever; you should let me handle this.
793,10,4,Bart Simpson,I'm a pretty bad kid.
794,10,4,Cartman,Really? What's the worst thing you've ever done?
795,10,4,Bart Simpson,I stole the head off a statue once.
796,10,4,Cartman,"Wow, that's pretty hardcore. Geez. That's like this one time, when I didn't like a kid, so I ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him."
797,10,4,Bart Simpson,"[compares the two acts in his mind...] You got it, man. You got it. [hops onto his skateboard and skates off]"
798,10,4,Cartman,Seeya.
799,10,4,President Bush,"I want to assure the American people that as President, I have exhausted every possible solution. Unfortunately, Mohammad will appear uncensored on Family Guy tonight at seven."
800,10,4,Reporters,[clamoring] Mr. President!
801,10,4,Reporter 1,"[rises] Mr. President, can't the writers of the show be reasoned with? Don't they know they're putting the country in danger? [sits]"
802,10,4,President Bush,I have come to... understand something about the Family Guy writing staff. Suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence.
803,10,4,Reporters,[clamoring] Mr. President!
804,10,4,Reporter 1,"[same one as before] What exactly did you learn about the Family Guy writing staff, Mr. President?"
805,10,4,President Bush,"[thinks a moment, then leans into the mic and says in a low voice] I'm afraid that information is classified."
806,10,4,Reporters,[in unison] AWWW!!! [then clamoring] Mr. President!
807,10,4,TCO Reporter,"[rises] Mr. President, can't you force the Family Guy writing staff not to write anything about Mohammad? [sits]"
808,10,4,LSX Reporter,[rises] Couldn't you throw them in prison? [sits]
809,10,4,President Bush,Look! The fact of the matter is the Family Guy writing staff is protected by something called the First Amendment!
810,10,4,Reporter 2,"And what exactly is this First Amendment, Mr. President?"
811,10,4,President Bush,"[beat] Uh you know, the right to free speech."
812,10,4,Reporters,[in unison] AWWW!!! [they begin to fight furiously and clamor amongst themselves]
813,10,4,Reporter 3,"[rises] Mr. President, when your administration came up with this ""First Amendment,"" did it not foresee a problem like this might happen? [sits]"
814,10,4,President Bush,[beat] Well... We didn't come up with the First Amendment. It was already in place.
815,10,4,TCO Reporter,"[rises] What do you intend to do about this ""First Amendment,"" Mr. President? [sits]"
816,10,4,Reporter 4,"[rises] Forgive me, Mr. President, but this ""First Amendment"" sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob? [sits]"
817,10,4,Reporters,Yeah!
818,10,4,Reporter 5,That's right!
819,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"Okay, let's discuss the fall lineup."
820,10,4,Receptionist 2,"[enters] Sir, there's still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the Family Guy episode"
821,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"All right, let's get this over with. [Cartman enters the room leaning on a crutch]"
822,10,4,Cartman,"[removes his cap] Hello, gentlemen, ladies. My name is little Danny Pocket. And I won't take much of your time. Please excuse my tiny crutch; it's the only way I can get around these days. Ow..."
823,10,4,Staff,"Oh, poor kid."
824,10,4,Cartman,"You see, my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of Denmark. His newspaper showed an image of Mohammad and, two days later, terrorists suicides bombed his building. I was in the lobby when it happened. [shocked looks on the faces of the staff] First one terrorist suicide bombed us and, then dozens more. They just kept coming. Suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another! They were like Mexican jumping beans. I just don't wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt, because... that would be, of course, your responsibility. [coughs] Ow.."
825,10,4,FOX President (Doug),I feel terrible. It's so east to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face.
826,10,4,Staffer,"Sir, if we pull the episode, the Family Guy writing staff will refuse to work again."
827,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"Little boy, will you talk to the Family Guy writing staff? If your story touches their hearts like it has ours, perhaps they'll back down from demanding we air the episode."
828,10,4,Cartman,I'll certainly do my best. [coughs] Ow.
829,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"Take this noble child over to the Family Guy offices. If he can scare them like he has us, maybe we can pull the Mohammad episode after all."
830,10,4,Cartman,"[turns and walks out, and says softly with an evil smile] Yes, and then Family Guy is as good as dead."
831,10,4,FOX President (Doug),What was that?
832,10,4,Cartman,"[stops and turns] I I said ""thank you."" Thank you for listening. [walks out again]"
833,10,4,Kyle,Thanks a lot for the ride.
834,10,4,Trucker,"Ey, it's the least I could do. I hope you succeed, kid. I really don't wanna see Family Guy go off the air. I love that show!"
835,10,4,Kyle,I'll do everything I can.
836,10,4,Trucker,"I mean, I know it's just joke after joke, but I like that. At least it doesn't get all preachy and up its own ass with messages, you know? [drives off]"
837,10,4,Kyle,"[noticing Bart writing, but doesn't see the actual text] Excuse me. [Bart stops writing and approaches Kyle] Do you know which way the network president's office is?"
838,10,4,Bart Simpson,Who wants to know?!
839,10,4,Kyle,"Look, my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting Family Guy off the air."
840,10,4,Bart Simpson,"[eyes narrowing] The network president's office is in there! [points to his right, to a small red building labeled ""154 c""]"
841,10,4,Kyle,"Oh thanks, dude."
842,10,4,Bart Simpson,"No problem, man. [smiles, knowing Kyle isn't going to the right building]"
843,10,4,Kyle,"[looks around] Hello? This can't be right, I- [Bart whacks him from behind with a skateboard, and he falls forward] Ow!"
844,10,4,Bart Simpson,"Cowabunga, motherfucker!"
845,10,4,Receptionist 2,[behind a desk] Hello Mitchell.
846,10,4,Mitchell,"Oh hi, Miss Travis."
847,10,4,Miss Travis,The president has asked that little Danny Pocket here speak with the Family Guy writing staff.
848,10,4,Mitchell,[rises and walks forth] Are you... sure? They're working on a new episode right now.
849,10,4,Cartman,"It won't take long, sir. [coughs with more energy] Ow..."
850,10,4,Mitchell,"All right, I'll take him back. Follow me, little Danny. [walks back to the writing area. Cartman follows.] You must be excited. Not many people get to meet our writing staff."
851,10,4,Cartman,"[removes his cap] Yes, I'm totally excited. Family Guy is so funny."
852,10,4,Mitchell,"Well, here we are. Danny, the Family Guy writing staff."
853,10,4,Cartman,"[stops and stares] Wha? [before him is a wall tank the height of the writing room. Manatees are swimming slowly within, and a huge pile of plastic balls sits at one end of the tank. Some of them are snacking on snall fish] What are they?"
854,10,4,Mitchell,"They're manatees. [gray manatees] Gretchen and Flubber are from the Gulf of Mexico. Tinker, Pete and Lucy are from the Caribbean Sea."
855,10,4,Cartman,"Family Guy is written by manatees? [rethinks] Of course, it all makes sense now."
856,10,4,Mitchell,"They really are brilliant creatures. [the camera focuses on the ball pile] You see, the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls. [the camera zooms in and pans across] Each ball has a verb, noun, or pop culture reference written on it. There's millions of them. [A manatee swims to the left side of the tank balancing a ball on its nose] The manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank. [another manatee swims into the pile] Uh there goes Gretchen! She's comin' up with an idea. Oh, she came up with Gary Coleman. [another manatee reaches the combine and drops a ball in] The idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script. [the ball reads ""Mexico"" as it goes down the pipe into the sorter] Laundry Date Winning Mexico Gary Coleman. A perfect Family Guy joke! I can see it now!"
857,10,4,Lois,"Peter, you didn't do the laundry today."
858,10,4,Peter,You think that's bad? Remember the time I won a date to Mexico with Gary Coleman?
859,10,4,Waiter,"Qu pasa, seores?"
860,10,4,Gary Coleman,"Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Willis?"
861,10,4,Cartman,Waitwaitaminute waitaminute. These... manatees demanded that Mohammad be shown? How? Manatees don't talk!
862,10,4,Mitchell,"When FOX censored the image of Mohammad last week, it also meant that the Mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank. It made the manatees very upset. Pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank, and the manatees stop working. He-here, I'll show you. [looks up] Keith? [Keith, seated at the top of the tank, reaches in and pulls out a green RIVERDANCE ball. The manatees stop in their tracks and slowly drop down as the balls they're carrying slip away from them] All right all right, put it back in! [Keith drops it back in. The manatees respond quickly and resume work] Manatees are very ethical writers. Either everything's okay to write about, or nothing is. Anyway, the president of the network wanted you to ...speak with the manatees."
863,10,4,Cartman,"Oh... yes, yes. Um [clears his throat and talks to the tank] hello, manatees. I, I think you should allow the network to pull your episode with Mohammad. See, I'm the victim of a, a terrorist attack and... terrorists might come after you if you-"
864,10,4,Mitchell,That isn't gonna work on them.
865,10,4,Cartman,Why not?
866,10,4,Mitchell,Don't you know anything about manatees? They're the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats.
867,10,4,Cartman,[softly] Son of a bitch.
868,10,4,Kyle,"[calling to Bart] Let me out of here, kid! Why are you doing this?"
869,10,4,Cartman,"[voice] Well well well! [now shown walking up to Bart, who's keeping watch while leaning on his skateboard. Cartman has a mean air of satisfaction on him]"
870,10,4,Kyle,Cartman!
871,10,4,Cartman,"Hello, Kyle. Looks like you've run into a little snag in your plan as well."
872,10,4,Kyle,You fat sun of a bitch!
873,10,4,Cartman,"You came so close to stopping me, didn't you, Kyle. There was just one thing you didn't count on: that more people besides me hate Family Guy."
874,10,4,Bart Simpson,Yeah.
875,10,4,Kyle,"Well, a lot of people like Family Guy too! Who are you to decide it shouldn't be on the air?!"
876,10,4,Bart Simpson,"Shut up! [points to Kyle] You shut your fucking face, man! [to Cartman] Did it work? Did you scare the network into pulling the episode?"
877,10,4,Cartman,"Not yet! But I've come up with a new plan. I've learned how to make the Family Guy writing staff stop working! As soon as everyone goes on their lunch break, I can sneak back in."
878,10,4,Bart Simpson,Cool man!
879,10,4,Kyle,"Cartman, let me out of this stupid net!!"
880,10,4,Cartman,"Good, Kyle! That's good anger you're showin' there! See that?! That's emotional character development based on what's happening in the storyline! Not at all like Family Guy. Now, if you'll excuse me, Kyle, [turns and walks away] I've got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank."
881,10,4,Kyle,WHAT?!
882,10,4,FOX President (Doug),I don't understand it. What's wrong with them? [the manatees are floating aimlessly]
883,10,4,Mitchell,"We don't know, Mr. President. They just stopped working."
884,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"[concerned] But, nobody took any idea balls out of the tank, did they?"
885,10,4,Mitchell,"No sir, none of us did. [Cartman smiles and looks around at the results of his handiwork]"
886,10,4,FOX President (Doug),Then why are they refusing to write? I agreed to show Mohammad uncensored! I did what you asked! WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME??!!
887,10,4,Cartman,"[hobbles up to him] Sir! Sir! [faces him] If you don't my saying, I think you asked for this. You gave in to the manatees last week. Now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want. You spoiled them by caving in. Now they thnk they can walk all over you. [they both turn to face the tank] Sir, you are in charge of this network, not them. Maybe it's time you showed them who's in charge."
888,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"You're right. It's time I stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do! I'm pulling the Mohammad episode, you got that?! And if you all don't want to work tomorrow, you can just find other jobs!! [faces the staff] How long before Family Guy's supposed to air?!"
889,10,4,Executive,Twenty-five minutes.
890,10,4,FOX President (Doug),I gotta hurry! [rushes off]
891,10,4,Cartman,I did it. I... AM... GOD!!!
892,10,4,Cartman,"Family Guy is going off the air! No more Family Guy for me, mon frre!"
893,10,4,Kyle,[appears in the shadows] Cartman!! [Cartman stops in his tracks] You fucking fatass!
894,10,4,Cartman,How the hell did you get out?
895,10,4,Kyle,That kid and I had a long talk! I told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you!
896,10,4,Cartman,"Aw, God damnit, you gave him one of your gay little speeches, didn't you?!"
897,10,4,Kyle,[seething in anger] You are NOT KILLING FAMILY GUY!!
898,10,4,Cartman,"You're too late, Kyle! The president of the network is pulling the episode! Family Guy is as good as dead!"
899,10,4,Kyle,[checks his watch] There's still time to tell the network president you're full of CRAP! [runs off]
900,10,4,Cartman,[runs ahead and cuts him off] I can't let you do that!
901,10,4,Kyle,Get out of my way or I'll kick your ass!
902,10,4,Cartman,"[takes off his mittens] Fine, Kyle. I guess it was inevitable. [Kyle removes his left mitten with his teeth and spits it away] Let this be our final battle. [they put on their battle faces and begin fighting, which is shown dispassionately. It's all a long series of slaps] Ow. OW! Stop it! Kyle, that's too hard! Ah! [they begin to move along a sidewalk] Ugh. Kyle! Stop it!"
903,10,4,Kyle,Ow. Quit it!
904,10,4,Cartman,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Bleh. Kyle! [throws him up against a wall. They slap each other some more and Kyle throws Cartman up against the wall. Some more fighting and Cartman throws Kyle up against a window, but they both crash through it into the King of the Hill offices.]"
905,10,4,Cartman,Stop it!
906,10,4,Kyle,Ow. Quit it!
907,10,4,Cartman,"Ow. Quit it, Kyle! Leh- Kyle! Let go- Okay okay come on, time out. Kyle, time out! Time out! Time out. [Kyle stops his attack and a few seconds of silence follow. Then] Time in! [slaps Kyle hard. Kyle waits for a writer to stop staring, then resumes his attack] I d-ow! Uh. Ah. Sh-gah. Okay. Okay. Time out! Kyle t-time out! Time out! Time out! Time out! Time out!"
908,10,4,Kyle,"No more timeouts, fatass!"
909,10,4,Cartman,"Time out! Time out! Time out, Kyle! Ay! Ay!"
910,10,4,Cartman,"Kyle! Kyle! Get the... Get the- Kyle! Kyle, dude, that was- that was in the balls! Dude, serious- seriously! That was in the balls! No hitting- No hitting in the balls! [throws Kyle off, but they resume fighting] Kyle! [Kyle finally gets Cartman in a reverse headlock. A few seconds later, he begins punching Cartman on the ribs] Quit it, Kyle. Give it up, Kyle! [gets out of the headlock, but the fighting resumes] Okay... Okay! Okay okay! [the fighting stops, and they're both panting] You win! You win. I give up. [kicks Kyle square in the nuts. Kyle doubles over in pain, coughing, and Cartman grins] Hahaha! I had my fingers crossed. [Kyle is still immobile, but a skateboard whacks Cartman from behind. Cartman falls over and Bart is there]"
911,10,4,Kyle,"[coughs] Thanks, kid."
912,10,4,FOX President (Doug),Network Control! This is the President! I want you to pull the episode.
913,10,4,Woman and fellow Programmers,"[whispers] What? [in normal tone] Mr. President, are you sure? [the other programmers look at her]"
914,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"I'm sure. Begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900. [two programmers raise their access keys and insert them into corresponding locks in their desks, then turn the keys. Between their desks is a big red ""PULL EPISODE"" button. Its lid pops up and it begins flashing]"
915,10,4,Computer Voice,Abort System initiated.
916,10,4,Programmer 1,Awaiting confirmation.
917,10,4,Woman and fellow Programmers,"Mr. President, we need your final approval code."
918,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"President approval code [Kyle runs past the office, but notices and comes back] 0-0-destruct-"
919,10,4,Kyle,[runs in and interrupts] Sir! Mister television executive! Stop!
920,10,4,FOX President (Doug),Who are you?
921,10,4,Kyle,Listen to me: the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child. He only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of Family Guy forever!
922,10,4,FOX President (Doug),The end of Family Guy?
923,10,4,Woman and fellow Programmers,"Mr. President, we need final authorization!"
924,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"Hold on, Julie! [covers the transmitter] What are you talking about, kid?"
925,10,4,Kyle,Pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely. It's what happened to Laverne & Shirley.
926,10,4,FOX President (Doug),You mean... the manatees aren't trying to run the network?
927,10,4,Kyle,What manatees??!! [a fist knocks him away and Cartman steps in]
928,10,4,Cartman,"Go ahead, Mr. President! Continue what you were doing!"
929,10,4,Kyle,"[quickly rises] No! You have to show Mohammad, Mr. President!"
930,10,4,Woman and fellow Programmers,"Mr. President, we're awaiting your orders!"
931,10,4,Kyle,"Sir, just think about what you're doing to free speech!"
932,10,4,Cartman,No! Think about the people who could get hurt!
933,10,4,FOX President (Doug),Ah... I don't know who to listen to!
934,10,4,Cartman,"Okay, I'll make it easy for you. [pulls out a gun and aims it at the president] Pull the Mohammad episode, now!"
935,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"Okay, I'll listen to you. [gets back to the phone] Julie?"
936,10,4,Kyle,Noo! Wait! You can't listen to him! He's a lying deceitful monster who only wants Family Guy off the air!
937,10,4,FOX President (Doug),But he has a gun.
938,10,4,Kyle,You can't do what he wants just because he's the one threatening you with violence!
939,10,4,Cartman,"Shut up, Kyle!"
940,10,4,FOX President (Doug),I can't be responsible for people getting hurt. Especially me.
941,10,4,Kyle,"Yes, people can get hurt. That's how terrorism works. But if you give into that, Doug, you're allowing terrorism to work. Do the right thing here."
942,10,4,Cartman,"Give the orders to pull the episode, Mr. President!"
943,10,4,FOX President (Doug),I shouldn't even be in the office still. It's supposed to be half-day Friday.
944,10,4,Woman and fellow Programmers,"Mr. President, thirty seconds to airtime. What do you want us to do?!"
945,10,4,Kyle,"Do the right thing, Mr. President."
946,10,4,FOX President (Doug),"How about I allow the episode to air but, just censor out the image of Mohammad again."
947,10,4,Kyle,"I wish that was good enough, but if you censor out Mohammad, then soon you'll have to censor out more."
948,10,4,Cartman,"No gay speeches, Kyle!"
949,10,4,Kyle,"If you don't show Mohammad, then you've made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at, and what isn't. Either it's all okay, or none of it is."
950,10,4,Woman and fellow Programmers,"Five seconds, Mr. President! [the programmer J. Walker has his finger hovering on the button]"
951,10,4,Kyle,[softly] Do the right thing. Show Mohammad. [Cartman still has his gun on the president] Do. The right. Thing.
952,10,4,Woman and fellow Programmers,"Mr. President, we need a decision now!"
953,10,4,FOX President (Doug),Family Guy goes on air as planned. Uncensored.
954,10,4,Kyle,Yes! [dances]
955,10,4,Cartman,"No! No, I hate Family Guy!! [tries to fire the gun, but it seems to be empty. No bullets come out. He throws it down.]"
956,10,4,Woman and fellow Programmers,"Air it! [a different programmer gives his thumbs up and then turns to press the ""AIR EPISODE"" button. The credits come up and the self-destruct programmers remove their keys and sigh in relief. The ""PULL EPISODE"" lid comes down]"
957,10,4,Lois,Peter! You got a pink slip at work?
958,10,4,Peter,You think that's bad? Remember the time I got a salmon helmet from Mohammad while wearing a toga?
959,10,4,Peter,"[dressed in a toga, answers the door] Coming Mohammad. [opens the door. A salmon helmet appears and he reaches out to grab it]"
960,10,4,Peter,"Wow, a salmon helmet! Thanks! [closes the door and goes back to the sofa]"
961,10,4,Peter,"Anyway, what were we talking about?"
962,10,4,Peter,"Oh yeah, my pink slip."
963,10,4,President Bush,"Hey, that wasn't bad at all. They just showed Mohammad standin' there, lookin' normal."
964,10,4,An Official,"Mr. President, the terrorists are retaliating!"
965,10,4,President Bush,What?!
966,10,4,Peter,Or the time I- [click. SNN shows up onscreen]
967,10,4,SNN anchor,"As soon as the image of Mohammad appeared, terrorist leader al-Zawahri announced the retaliation!"
968,10,4,Al Zawahri,"[translated] We warned you not to show Mohammad- But ""Family Guy"" did it anyways. So now, here is our retaliation on America!!!"
969,10,5,Waiter Chris,"Hi, welcome to P.F Chang's. How spicy would you like me to make your Chang sauce?"
970,10,5,Head Waiter,"Chris, the people at Table 3 need their check."
971,10,5,Waiter Chris,[whispers] I know. I'm swamped. I've got no help here!
972,10,5,Head Waiter,Well what about the new waiter?
973,10,5,Waiter Chris,"The new waiter is useless. And, I think he's high."
974,10,5,Towelie,"[at another table, mixing sauce...] How spicy would you like your Chang sauce?"
975,10,5,Male Diner,"Will you just place our order, please?"
976,10,5,Towelie,"Oh man, I have no idea what's goin' on."
977,10,5,Head Waiter,Everything okay here?
978,10,5,Male Diner,"Fine, except this towel has been mixing Chang sauce for fifteen minutes. He's clueless!"
979,10,5,Towelie,Don't call me shoeless! You're shoeless!
980,10,5,Male Diner,Yeah? Well you're a towel!
981,10,5,Towelie,You're a towel!
982,10,5,Head Waiter,"All right, that's it! Get out of here! You're fired!"
983,10,5,Towelie,Yeah!
984,10,5,Head Waiter,"Not him, you!"
985,10,5,Towelie,Awww.
986,10,5,Towelie,"Aw man, I really screwed up this time. The rent's due at the end of the month, and I don't have any money. I need to shape up and find a new job, quick. [stops] But first, maybe I'll get a little high. [pulls out a lighter and joint, and lights up. His eyes change color from white to pink] Wait. Here it goes. Good ideas comin'. Yeah. Hey yeah! I should become a writer! If I just write a book about my life, I can get it published and then make plenty of money to pay rent."
987,10,5,Towelie,"A MILLION LITTLE FIBERS
By
Toweleeeie

This is a really good idea..."
988,10,5,Publisher 1,"Aha. Mmm. Yes. Yes, I see. Well, that's quite a fascinating story, you being engineered as a towel with a computer chip that determines dryness."
989,10,5,Towelie,Yep! And it's all true.
990,10,5,Publisher 1,"Chapters 4 through 8, however, seem to all be about Doritos Brand Corn Chips."
991,10,5,Towelie,I guess I could edit those chapters down some.
992,10,5,Publisher 1,"Don't bother. I'm sorry to tell you this, sir, but nobody's ever going to publish your memoirs."
993,10,5,Towelie,Huh? Why not?
994,10,5,Publisher 1,"Well, just the small trivial fact that... people aren't interested in autobiographies of towels."
995,10,5,Towelie,"Wull yeah, but, maybe people will read my memoirs and like, apply its lessons to their own lives."
996,10,5,Publisher 1,No. They won't. Because they're people. And you're a towel.
997,10,5,Towelie,You're a towel!
998,10,5,Publisher 1,No. I'm a big book publisher who's not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs. You're a towel.
999,10,5,Towelie,"Now what am I gonna do? I gotta pay rent and I just wasted three weeks writin' my memoirs. It's time for me to stop bein' so irresponsible. I've gotta shape up, focus, an' come up with real solutions to my problems. [pulls out his joint and lighter again] I'd better get a little high. [strikes the flint once, but doesn't light the joint] Oh, maybe I shouldn't."
1000,10,5,Joint,"But you have to think of somethin' fast, an' gettin' high makes you smart."
1001,10,5,Towelie,"All right, I'll just use my special gettin'-high powers one more time. [lights the joint and sucks some fumes in. His eyes turn pink again] Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Of course! That's it! Why didn't I think of it before? [grins a small grin]"
1002,10,5,Towelie,"[in the stacks of a library, he proof-reads] All my life I've been a pretty irresponsible towel. [crosses out ""towel"" and writes] person. I thought I was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels. [crosses out ""towels"" and writes] people. [the next sentence reads ""But as I pursued my derelict...""] This is a really good idea."
1003,10,5,Publisher 2,"Ogh. Oh my God. Uh I could not believe a human being has led this kind of life, Mr...!"
1004,10,5,Towelie,[wears a small fedora and fake mustache] McTowelie. Steven McTowelie.
1005,10,5,Publisher 2,"It's heartbreaking passages like this one: ""I am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me."" I know this company would be honored to publish this book. I just have one small question first. You're not... a towel, are you?"
1006,10,5,Towelie,"...No. If I was a towel, why would I be wearin' this hat, an' this fake mustache?"
1007,10,5,Publisher 2,"Right, I'm sorry. [rises] Well Steveen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now. We're in business, sir."
1008,10,5,Towelie,[quite pleased] All right!
1009,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Thank you so much. [the applause dies down] Once in a while I come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life. [holds up a book] ""A Million Little Fibers"" is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory. Please welcome author Stevem McTowelie! [she fairly sings his last name. Towelie comes out to cheers from the audience and climbs onto the sofa with some difficulty] Steven, when I read your book, I thought to myself, ""How can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay?"""
1010,10,5,Towelie,"Well, I guess I'm just an extra-special tow- [stops himself] person."
1011,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"You talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack. What would that do to you emotionally? You have been through... so much, [the camera pans down to her crotch] and I think that people all over America could benefit..."
1012,10,5,Her crotch,"[in one UK accent] Oh God, there she goes again, babblin' about people's lives and carryin' on. She hasn't paid any attention to me in years!"
1013,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,...a life that kept getting up whenever it was down...
1014,10,5,Her crotch,"Nobody knows what it's like to be Oprah's minge. All she does is work, never gives her ol' minge a nice rub now and again. A minge needs attention! At least a scratch once in a while!"
1015,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Well Steven, your book hasn't sold a lot of copies yet, but I have some pretty exciting news for you!"
1016,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Used to be a time when Oprah would play with me night and day. She'd pet me for hours usin' every finger. Now I just sit here, in the dark, not even so much as a pinky! I should write a book! Be much more depressin' than his!"
1017,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"And so, Steven, I'm making your book my official Book of the Month selection! [sing-song ending]"
1018,10,5,Towelie,Really? [the audience cheers] Wow. I'm gonna get super-rich now.
1019,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"[talking to her programming people] Uh huh, okay. Well listen, maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th. All right, is John Travolta available to be a guest the week after that? Okay, that might work better since it's Sweeps Week."
1020,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Can't take it anymore. All she ever does is work work work, never pays attention to the ol' minge. I'm always trapped in these stuffy pantsuits. I want attention! I'm bloody bored!"
1021,10,5,A voice,[in a different UK accent] Oh stop your complainin'! I'm tryin' to sleep back here.
1022,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Ay, 'oo's that? Is that you, Gary?"
1023,10,5,Gary,Yes it's me. You think you've go' it bad? Oprah hasn't paid any attention to me in years.
1024,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Oh, what do you care? You're just an asshole. I'm a minge! Minges need stimulation."
1025,10,5,Gary,"Assholes need stimulation too, you bastard! I want to travel. I want to see Paris. I thought lamp was goin' to get better, but Oprah's always busy. Werkin' and werkin', diyatin' and not diyatin'. I need a pukin' up mounds of chocolate cake or teaspoons of weedgrass."
1026,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",She's a workaholic. Let's face it: the only way we're ever goin' tuh get any attention is if Oprah doesn't work anymore.
1027,10,5,Gary,Well that'll never happen.
1028,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",Not unless she gets fired.
1029,10,5,Gary,"[wonders] Fired... You got a plan, Mingie?"
1030,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","That bloke on the show today, the one Oprah supported. 'E isn't a bloke at all. 'E's a towel."
1031,10,5,Gary,Ooo. How d'you know?
1032,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","[low, ominous voice] I'm a minge. Minges know a towel when they hear one. If evidence gets out that Oprah's champion author is a towel, she'll look right foolish. Fans'll start droppin' off by the millions."
1033,10,5,Gary,'Ow do we get proof?
1034,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",We get somebody else to do it. The greatest investiga'ive reporter of our time.
1035,10,5,Butler Dimitri,Mr. Rivera.
1036,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,"What is it, Dimitri?"
1037,10,5,Butler Dimitri,"There's somebody on the phone to speak with you. He says he has inside information for you that may discredit Oprah Winfrey. [Geraldo stops, rises, and goes into his private offce, where he answers the phone]"
1038,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,[sits down] Thith ith Geraldo.
1039,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",[somehow on the phone] 'Allo 'Eraldo. I've got some information for you ya might find interestin'. It could make Oprah Winfrey look quite foolish.
1040,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,Who am I thpeaking with?!
1041,10,5,Gary,'E wants to know who 'e's speakin' with.
1042,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Let's just say I work very closely with Oprah. You'd like to see 'er discredited, wouldn't ya?"
1043,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,[his left hand spread out over his chest] What information do you have?
1044,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",What'd 'e say?
1045,10,5,Gary,He wants to know what information we have.
1046,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Just tell me wha' 'e says, Gary! Don't wait for me 'o ask you ""wha' 'e say?""!"
1047,10,5,Gary,Stop wastin' my time.
1048,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Ay, don't get snooty with me, Gary!"
1049,10,5,Gary,"I didn't say ""stop wastin' my time,"" Geraldo did."
1050,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,What ith going on here?!
1051,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Oh all right Gary, this isn't workin'. Let's switch. I'll listen and you talk. [a few second later]"
1052,10,5,Gary,Hallo?
1053,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,Who ith thith?
1054,10,5,Gary,This is Gary.
1055,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,Gary who?! What is your last name?!
1056,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",Don't give away your name. We don't want anyone to know where we are.
1057,10,5,Gary,"A'right, look. All you need to know is that I'm definitely not Oprah's asshole."
1058,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",Aw you stupid twit!!
1059,10,5,Gary,"Don't call me a twit, Geraldo!"
1060,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","He didn't call you ""stupid twit,"" I did!! Now just tell 'im this:"
1061,10,5,Gary,The writer of the book on Oprah's Book of the Month Club is a phonih. He's not a person at all. He's a towel.
1062,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,A towel? A talking towel? That doethn't make any thenthe.
1063,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",Tell 'im 'e'd be surprised at things that can talk.
1064,10,5,Gary,You'd be surprised at things that can talk.
1065,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,What proof do you have of this accusation?!
1066,10,5,Gary,"Just look into the author of ""A Million Little Fiyabers,"" and you'll discover the truth."
1067,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,"And how do I go about that? [click, and a dial tone. Geraldo tries to get the caller back on] Hello? HELLO?!"
1068,10,5,Announcer,This is Larry King Live.
1069,10,5,Larry King,"[Towelie is in the guest chair] My guest tonight is Steven McTowelie, author of the acclaimed book, ""A Million LIttle Fibers."" How are you tonight, Steven?"
1070,10,5,Towelie,"Well Larry, I'm a little high."
1071,10,5,Larry King,Your book has helped a lot of people beat addiction. What made you write it?
1072,10,5,Towelie,"Well Larry, I was... really just writin' down my memoirs as I-"
1073,10,5,Larry King,"[holds his left hand up and looks to his director] What? What's that? Oh ex- oh excuse me, Steven, I understand that we have a special report coming in. Joining us live from Afghanistan, here is Geraldo Rivera. [a split screen comes up and Geraldo's feed struggles to come in]"
1074,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,"Hello? Larry, are you receiving me?"
1075,10,5,Larry King,"We're here, Geraldo. You're live on the show."
1076,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,"Larry, this brave reporter has been days investigating and researching, and I have come up with a shocking discovery that is going to rock the balls and ass of the literary world! Steven McTowelie, author of ""A Million LIttle Fibers,"" is a towel!"
1077,10,5,Towelie,You're a towel.
1078,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,"No, you're a towel."
1079,10,5,Towelie,Well you're a beaner towel.
1080,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,What did you say??
1081,10,5,Towelie,I'm sorry. I'm high.
1082,10,5,Aide 1,"This looks pretty bad, Oprah."
1083,10,5,Aide 2,"Your fans look to you to be all-knowing and all-seeing, and you've just spent two weeks supporting a lying racist towel."
1084,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","'E did it, Gary! 'Eraldo got the proof!"
1085,10,5,Gary,Oprah's got egg all over her face! She'll have to retire!
1086,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","It's the beginning of a new life for us, Gary. Without 'er career 'o worry about, Oprah's sure to travel the world! Enjoy the finer things in life! She'll spend hours just ... playin' with 'er own minge!"
1087,10,5,Gary,And her Gary too.
1088,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Sure. And 'er Gary. We did it, mate!"
1089,10,5,Aide 2,"Oprah, we need to know what we're going to do."
1090,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,What's the big deal? His book helped people. Why does it matter than he made some stuff up? Are people really going to be that mad?
1091,10,5,Protester 1,Your book got me to give up alcohol! But I thought you were a person!
1092,10,5,Protester 2,"Yeah, we want our money back, you dumb towel!"
1093,10,5,Latino Protesters,No insultar Mexicanos! Oye? No insultar Mexicanos! Oye?
1094,10,5,Towelie,"Oh God, I'm really in trouble now. [his phone rings and he answers] Hello?"
1095,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Steven, it's Oprah. Can you come on my show again tomorrow?"
1096,10,5,Towelie,Why?
1097,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"We need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book; that you thought it necessary to ""heighten"" certain things to make the book more relevant to people."
1098,10,5,Towelie,Hey yeah.
1099,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldn't matter if the book helps people, okay?"
1100,10,5,Towelie,Okay. Thanks Oprah! You're a real friend.
1101,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,See you tomorrow.
1102,10,5,Towelie,"All right, I got one chance here. I need to focus and come up with what I'm gonna say. [gets out his joint and lighter] Maybe I should get a little high. [stops himself] No! Wait a minute! I'm not going to get high this time. [closes his lighter]"
1103,10,5,Joint,"Aw, come on. You need to come up with ideas of what to say on Oprah."
1104,10,5,Towelie,"But, the ideas I come up with when I'm high keep gettin' me in trouble."
1105,10,5,Joint,Yeah. That's why you should only get a little high.
1106,10,5,Towelie,"Well, maybe just a little high. [lights up and starts tokin']"
1107,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Today my guest is once again Steven McTowelie, whose memoirs many of you purchased after I made it my Book of the Month Selection. [a sea of angry faces looks back at the stage]"
1108,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Ya hear that, Gary? Nobody's applaudin'!"
1109,10,5,Gary,Yeah! They're all right pissed off! This is great!
1110,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Now, it turns out that your name isn't really Steven. It's Towelie, correct?"
1111,10,5,Towelie,[sheepishly] Yeah.
1112,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,And you are a towel.
1113,10,5,Towelie,"Yes, I'm pretty much a towel, Oprah."
1114,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,Can you explain to the audience why you said you weren't a towel before?
1115,10,5,Towelie,"Well Oprah, I was all, like, um... uh, woo dat all like... It's like..."
1116,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,Was it that you thought embellishing the story was okay if it helped people?
1117,10,5,Towelie,"Yeah. Yeah, that's it!"
1118,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Well you know what I think, Towelie? I think you're a LYING SACK OF SHIT! [the audience is a little shocked] You lied to all these people, and for what??!! To make money!! They bought your book thinking it was true!!"
1119,10,5,Man 1,That's right!
1120,10,5,Man 2,Yeah.
1121,10,5,Towelie,But I thought you said-
1122,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,How DARE you like to me and make me look foolish?!
1123,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",What's this? What's she doin'?
1124,10,5,Gary,"I don't understand, Mingie."
1125,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"You think writing is a joke, you stupid towel?!"
1126,10,5,Man 3,"Yeah, you you get him, Oprah!"
1127,10,5,Oprah Audience Members/Fans/Hostages,Yeah!
1128,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,You will not get away with this!
1129,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","She's getting everyone back on 'er side! Oh, tha' clever cow!"
1130,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"You lied to me, Towelie! And therefore you have lied to America! [stands up] We are going to rise up against you! [the audience cheers her on] Is this audience ready for a good old-fashioned lynching?!"
1131,10,5,Oprah Audience Members/Fans/Hostages,Yeah!
1132,10,5,Towelie,Huh?
1133,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Audience, if you look under your seats, you'll find your very own torches! [the audience members reach down under their seats and pull up the torches they find there]"
1134,10,5,Oprah Audience Members/Fans/Hostages,Whoa.
1135,10,5,Gary,"Minge, does this mean I have to wait to see Paris?"
1136,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","There's not gonna be any Paris! Don't you get it, Gary?! The fat cow get everyone on 'er side again! She'll be workin' more than ever now! Our plan is ruined!"
1137,10,5,Gary,No!
1138,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,We'll give you a five-second headstart. [lights up her torch] One. Two. [throws away her lighter. Towelie hops off and starts running]
1139,10,5,Towelie,Hoooo!
1140,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,Let's get him! [turns right and chases him]
1141,10,5,Woman,Burn him! Burn the towel!
1142,10,5,Man 4,Burn that which lies to Oprah!
1143,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"Looks like your time is up, Towelie! I've led my adoring fans RIGHT to you!"
1144,10,5,Man 5,All right Oprah!
1145,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,I've shown my fans that... ugh! Ow! Wha?? [her pants rip open over her crotch and a handgun pops out]
1146,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",All right! Everyone back! Get back I said! [takes control of Oprah's body and turns her around. The fans cower]
1147,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,What the hell is this??!!
1148,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","[waves the gun around] Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt!"
1149,10,5,Gary,"Mingie, what're you doin'?"
1150,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Gettin' ou'a here Gary! One way or another! [a police officer shows up, gun at the ready]"
1151,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,What is going on??!!
1152,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","[aims the gun at Oprah's head] Shut up! Shut up, you miserable old cow, or so help me I'll blow your brains out! [aims it at the police officer] I want a chooper! You got that?! And a jet waiting at the airport!"
1153,10,5,Gary,"Mingie, have you lost your mind?"
1154,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Come on, Gary! You always said you wanted to see Paris!"
1155,10,5,Gary,"Not like this, Mingie. Not like this!"
1156,10,5,Chicago Police Officer,"[approaching cautiously, ready to fire his gun] All right, gig is up. Put down the gun!"
1157,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Stay back, mate!"
1158,10,5,Chicago Police Officer,Drop the gun and step away.
1159,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",I'm warnin' you!
1160,10,5,Chicago Police Officer,"[takes a few steps forward] Put it down, I said- [a gunshot hits him in the chest] Augh! [falls onto his knees] Gawhh [falls forward and dies]"
1161,10,5,Gary,Jesus Minge! You killed him! You shot him dead!
1162,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","No turnin' back now, Gary."
1163,10,5,Gary,"Oh God, I think I'm goinna be sick eh."
1164,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Oh keep your head, Gary."
1165,10,5,Gary,"I can't, uh... I'm goinna puke! [moments later he begins to puke]"
1166,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Ah, Gary, that smells awful! Now I'm gonna throw up! [moments later he begins to puke. Everyone is looking on in amazement. One of the fans begins to move slowly away from Oprah, but Mingie notices and aims the gun at him] Try to leave and I'll shoot you too! You hostages aren't goin' anywhere till we get what we want!"
1167,10,5,Man 6,"Oh my God, what are we goinna do?"
1168,10,5,Man 7,"You got us into this, towel. Think of somethin'!"
1169,10,5,Towelie,"All right, I'm gonna get a little high. [sets up to light the joint, but stops himself again] No! No I'm NOT gonna get high! Every time I get high, I come up with ideas that get me in more trouble. I'm not gettin' high this time!"
1170,10,5,Geraldo Rivera,"I'm standing in the business district of central Chicago, where Oprah's vagina has killed a police officer and taken several people hostage. It is yet unconfirmed but believed that Oprah's asshole may be an accomplice in this as well."
1171,10,5,SWAT Officer 1,Got the walkie-talkie you asked for.
1172,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Put it underneath me. [the SWAT officer bends down and place the walkie-talkie underneath Mingie] Slowly, mate, slowly! [the officer slides it in place] Now back off. [the officer backs away] All right, Gary, squeeze the walkie button. [click] This is Oprah's minge!"
1173,10,5,Lt Nelson,"Hellow, I'm Lieutenant Nelson. What are your demands?"
1174,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","I want a chopper, and a jet waiting at the airport to take us to France! Plus we need some fresh knickers right away."
1175,10,5,Lt Nelson,"All right, how about fresh underwear for one hostage."
1176,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","I'm not playing games with you, mate! Gary's drownin' in his own sick!"
1177,10,5,Lt Nelson,"All right, we'll work on it. Don't do anything foolish. [turns off the walkie talkie] We don't have any time; this is the most unstable vagina I've ever talked to."
1178,10,5,SWAT Officer 2,"O'Reilly, you got a shot?"
1179,10,5,O Reilly,[from a nearby rooftop] I got it. [has his sights on Oprah's minge]
1180,10,5,Lt Nelson,[shifting gears] Not with those hostages so close! It's too risky!
1181,10,5,Gary,"Oh just put down the gun, Mingie. Maybe they'll go easy on us."
1182,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Don't be stupid, Gary. I've got a policeman. They'll fry me, lock you up for life."
1183,10,5,Gary,"[emotional] Aw Mingie, I'm soo scared."
1184,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","We're gonna get out of here, mate. Just leave it to me."
1185,10,5,SWAT Officer 3,"Oprah's vagina, this is your last warning! Put down the gun!"
1186,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","If that chopper isn't here in two minutes, I'm killin' a hostage!"
1187,10,5,Towelie,"Hey wait a minute. [begins to move slowly, then quickly to the bank doors again. He thinks a moment, then slides in under the doors and stands up. He turns around and opens the doors] Pssst! [the hostages look and then move into the bank]"
1188,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",I mean it! Hostages are gonna start dyin' if you don't listen! [the hostages run through the bank and out the back doors]
1189,10,5,SWAT Officer 4,Hostages are clear!
1190,10,5,Lt Nelson,"All right, that's it. Take it out! [O'Reilly shoots]"
1191,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,AAAAaaah!
1192,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","What the? Haha! You missed me, you stewpid buggers! You see that Gary? They can't even aim!"
1193,10,5,Gary,[softly] Min... [louder] Mingie.
1194,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Gary, what's, what's wrong?"
1195,10,5,Gary,"They got me, Mingie."
1196,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",No... Oh no!
1197,10,5,Gary,"Aye. They got me bad. Oh, the blood."
1198,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Try to hang on, Gary!"
1199,10,5,Gary,"Ih... It's gettin' dark, Minge."
1200,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.",Oh Gary! What have I gotten ya into?
1201,10,5,Gary,I've seen muh life flash before me eyes. Mingie!
1202,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","I'm 'ere, Gary!"
1203,10,5,Gary,"Where... where are we, Mingie? Are we in Paris?"
1204,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Yeah. Yeah, we're in Paris, mate."
1205,10,5,Gary,Ahhh... Is it as wonderful as I 'oped?
1206,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Ih, it's beautiful. We've finally made it!"
1207,10,5,Gary,"Tell me what you see, Mingie."
1208,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","[getting emotional] Well, there's the... Eiffel Tower right in front of us. The Louvre, right over there behind ya. And f-fresh baguettes all around."
1209,10,5,Gary,"Ahhh... I can smell them, Mingie. At least I got to see Paris before I- [and no more is heard from him]"
1210,10,5,"Mingie and Gary, Oprah's private parts.","Gary? Gary, say somethin'. [Gary craps his last, or maybe it's just a final fart] You killed him, you bastards! He didn't even want any part in this! This is all your fault, you stupid cow! You never gave your ol' Gary the time of day and now he's gone! Life ain't worth livin' any more! What's the use?! ...I'm comin' to see you, Gary! [the gun is cocked] I'm comin' to see ya!"
1211,10,5,Oprah Winfrey,"No! Don't! [the gun goes off. Moments later, Oprah is put on a gurney and wheeled over to a waiting ambulance, and rolled in]"
1212,10,5,Lt Nelson,Oprah's going to be okay. Wish I could say the same for her vagina and asshole.
1213,10,5,Detective,That's a great idea you had to sneak the hostages inside the bank.
1214,10,5,Man 7,"Yeah, it sure was. We're sorry we tried to burn you and murder you before."
1215,10,5,Towelie,"Aw, that's okay. This whole thing was my fault. I learned that I shouldn't get high to come up with ideas. I should come up with ideas and then get high, to reward myself. [whips out his joint and lighter]"
1216,10,5,Joint,Youuu said it. [Towelie lights it up and chugs away]
1217,10,6,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, students, we have a very special guest speaker today. Who can tell me the name of our country's last vice-president?"
1218,10,6,Kyle,Dick Cheney?
1219,10,6,Mr Mackey,"No, the last one."
1220,10,6,Butters,Bill Clinton.
1221,10,6,Mr Mackey,"No, Clinton's vice-president. [no one has an answer] He is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues. Please welcome Al Gore. [some applause. Al Gore arrives and Mr. Mackey steps away to one side]"
1222,10,6,Stan,Who?
1223,10,6,Al Gore,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey, students of South Park Elementary.. I'm here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I'm talking of course about... [a projector comes on and a picture of a monster appears] ManBearPig. [a beast with the legs and tail of a pig, the body and arms of a bear, and the face and upper-body posture of a man]"
1224,10,6,Kyle,"[softly, to Stan] ManBearPig? [Stan just turns his hands up and shrugs]"
1225,10,6,Al Gore,"It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn't real. Well, I'm here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I'm serial. ManBearPig doesn't care who you are or what you've done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I'm super-serial. [Mr. Mackey and Mrs. Garrison just look at each other.] But have no fear, because I am here to save you! And someday, when the world is rid of ManBearPig, everyone will say ""Thank you, Al Gore. You're super awesome."" The end."
1226,10,6,Mr Mackey,"[reappears and claps a little] Uhhh, ohhhkay, thank you Mr. Gore."
1227,10,6,Al Gore,"Thank you, class. Excelsior! [Stan and Kyle just blink at each other]"
1228,10,6,Cartman,"[giggles as he dribbles] Check out this sweet move. [tries to dribble around Kyle, but Kyle blocks him] Kyle, you can't block like that."
1229,10,6,Kyle,"Just play the game, fatass!"
1230,10,6,Stan,"[open under the net] Pass it to me, Cartman?"
1231,10,6,Cartman,"Hang on. I'm going to do something killer. [tries to fake Kyle out, but Kyle taps the ball away. Cartman goes after it] God damnit, stop it, Kyle!"
1232,10,6,Cartman,"[tries again, moving Kyle back some] All right, check it out. This is a total Kobe Bryant I'm about to do. [keeps dribbling without making a move]"
1233,10,6,Kyle,"Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It's getting late!"
1234,10,6,Cartman,"Let's just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy! [again tries to get by Kyle, but Kyle taps the ball away again. Cartman chases it down again.] Kyle, knock it off! [the beast breaks through the bushes and steps onto the basketball court. Cartman continues to dribble]"
1235,10,6,Stan,"Cartman, stop hogging the goddamned ball!"
1236,10,6,Beast,"FOOD! [it's Al Gore in a homemade ManBearPig costume. The boys turn to see who it is] Don't worry, it's not really ManBearPig. It's me, Al Gore."
1237,10,6,Kyle,We know. [several seconds of silence follow]
1238,10,6,Cartman,"Dude, what are you doing?"
1239,10,6,Al Gore,"I'm spreading ManBearPig awareness. Here, each of you kids take a pamphlet and a bumper sticker. [Kyle looks at the sticker; the sticker has a ""ManBearPig"" crossed out by a red circle and bar, and the words ""We must all stop ManBearPig"" to the left of the ManBearPig]  I hope now you boys see that this is totally serial. The next time, it could be the ""real"" ManBearPig. Can I just get you to sign the awareness sheet? Just your name and phone number and where you first heard about ManBearPig?"
1240,10,6,Randy Marsh,"[waiting nearby in the family car] Uhh, Stan?"
1241,10,6,Stan,"Oh, hey Dad."
1242,10,6,Al Gore,[turns around slowly and waves] Hello.
1243,10,6,Randy Marsh,"[vigilant] It's ah, getting late, boys. Why don't you get in the car and I'll drive you all home?"
1244,10,6,Kyle,"Okay, Mr. Marsh. [the boys move towards the car]"
1245,10,6,Al Gore,"Be safe. [the boys get in the car and Randy drives off. Al Gore looks on as they leave, then turns around and walks off in the opposite direction]"
1246,10,6,Randy Marsh,"Boys, I don't want you hanging out with that ex vice-president anymore, okay?"
1247,10,6,Stan,"Aw, he's all right, Dad. He was just trying to warn us about ManBearPig."
1248,10,6,Randy Marsh,ManBearPig?
1249,10,6,Kyle,He's half man and half bearpig
1250,10,6,Cartman,"No, dude, he's half man and half bear and half pig."
1251,10,6,Kyle,That doesn't make any sense.
1252,10,6,Stan,"He could be half bear, half manpig."
1253,10,6,Randy Marsh,"Boys, there's no such thing as a ManBearPig. The vice president is just desperate for attention."
1254,10,6,Stan,"But I feel kind of bad for him, Dad. I don't think he has any friends."
1255,10,6,Stan,Hello?
1256,10,6,Al Gore,"Hello, this is Al Gore."
1257,10,6,Stan,[shuts his eyes and covers them with his left hand] Oh man... Hi Mr. Gore.
1258,10,6,Al Gore,I was the vice president.
1259,10,6,Stan,I know.
1260,10,6,Al Gore,Can you and your friends make it to an emergency ManBearPig meeting tomorrow morning? I have some evidence he could be in this area.
1261,10,6,Stan,"Eh look, I'm sorry but, we're all kind of busy."
1262,10,6,Al Gore,[several seconds of silence] Oh. I get it. You don't believe me either.
1263,10,6,Stan,"No, no, it's not that."
1264,10,6,Al Gore,Yes it is. Nobody believes me! [gets emotional] I'm trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial! [begins weeping over the phone] I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once.
1265,10,6,Stan,"Ih it's okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you."
1266,10,6,Al Gore,No you don't.
1267,10,6,Stan,"Yeah, I'm sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped. I'm just... I'm just scared that I can't do anything to stop him."
1268,10,6,Al Gore,Are you serial?
1269,10,6,Stan,"...Yes, I'm serial."
1270,10,6,Al Gore,[reinvigorated] Don't worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! [hangs up]
1271,10,6,Cartman,"Dude, why are we going to hang out with this guy?"
1272,10,6,Kenny,"(Yeah, I don't get it.)"
1273,10,6,Stan,"Come on, you guys, Al Gore doesn't have any friends. We'll just make an appearance at his little meeting and then we'll go. [the door opens and Al Gore greats the boys]"
1274,10,6,Al Gore,"Hi kids! Come on in! [the boys follow him in] Okay, let's get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?"
1275,10,6,Stan,"Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad's a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn't in Colorado."
1276,10,6,Al Gore,"[alerted, goes down on one knee] What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??"
1277,10,6,Stan,NO.
1278,10,6,Al Gore,"Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him."
1279,10,6,Stan,"Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn't it, guys? But, we gotta get goin' to school now."
1280,10,6,Al Gore,"[an alarm goes off nearby] Oh my God! [runs to his control center and leans back in his chair to look closely at his monitor. He begins to type quickly] ManBearPig screen active! What is this area of Colorado! It's a it's a cave of some kind! [a map of Cave of the Winds is shown, with the target below the text blinking]"
1281,10,6,Kyle,"Yeah, that's Cave of the Winds. It's a tourist attraction."
1282,10,6,Al Gore,"Oh Jesus on ice skates, we've gotta get down there right away."
1283,10,6,Cartman,"Ah I don't think so, dude. [the boys head for the door]"
1284,10,6,Kyle,"Yeah, we've got school anyway."
1285,10,6,Al Gore,I can get you all excused from school. [the boys stop in their tracks and turn around.]
1286,10,6,Cartman,You... have that kind of power?
1287,10,6,Al Gore,Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I'm totally serial!
1288,10,6,Tour Guide,"Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado. [his head bobs as he sighs] Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore. [one or two people clap, and Gore smiles at the two ladies, one on either side of him] Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?"
1289,10,6,Tour Group,Yeah.
1290,10,6,Tour Guide,"Let's go cavin'. [turns on his headlight, opens the velvet rope and leads the group into the cave]"
1291,10,6,Tour Guide,Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.
1292,10,6,Al Gore,Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?
1293,10,6,Tour Guide,"[to Al Gore] Ahh, no. [addressing the group] Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave's..."
1294,10,6,Al Gore,"All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings."
1295,10,6,Kyle,What do ManBearPig droppings look like?
1296,10,6,Al Gore,"Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike."
1297,10,6,Tour Guide,"These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named ""The Hanging Mushroom."" [a solid stalactite in the shape of a penis] And over here we have ""Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls."" [a massive stalagmite, again in the shape of a penis and two large testicles] And finally, of course, the ""Two Sisters."" [two smaller stalagmites, each the shape of a penis and testicles] Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees."
1298,10,6,Al Gore,Groan! Groan! [this stops the tour and everyone turns to face him]
1299,10,6,Tour Guide,Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?
1300,10,6,Al Gore,Not yet.
1301,10,6,Tour Guide,"All right, everyone, if you'll step this way, you'll see how the cave gets its name. [the group moves forward]"
1302,10,6,Al Gore,"[looks at an opening and motions the kids over] Kids! Kids, over here! Look."
1303,10,6,Kyle,What?
1304,10,6,Al Gore,I bet this is where he's hiding. [shines his light around] This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on! [goes down the path he found] Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I'm serial! [the boys follow him down the path. They have officially broken from the group.]
1305,10,6,Tour Guide,"In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear. [the cave begins to howl]"
1306,10,6,Tour Group,Wow...
1307,10,6,Woman in the Tour Group,"Take a picture of the sound, Steven. [her husband takes the picture.]"
1308,10,6,Stan,"Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group."
1309,10,6,Al Gore,"[hearing the wind] Wait! Shhh. [concludes] Christ! He's here! Take this rope! [hands some rope to Stan] Be ready to tie him up! [brings out a shotgun] I've got you now, you son of a bitch! [begins shooting randomly, and bits of the cave ceiling begin falling]"
1310,10,6,Kyle,What are you doing?! [bigger chunks of cave fall between Al Gore and the boys]
1311,10,6,Stan,Oh no!
1312,10,6,Al Gore,No!
1313,10,6,The Boys,Aaaah! [the boys are now sealed off from Al Gore. Gore turns around and assumes the worst]
1314,10,6,Al Gore,"Leave them alone, you Goddamned ManBearPig!"
1315,10,6,The Boys,Help!
1316,10,6,Al Gore,Damn you ManBearPig! They're just children!
1317,10,6,Tour Guide,"O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now! [the group turns around and runs back towards the entrance. The collapse follows the group] Go! Go! Go out, now! [the last person out of the cave is Al Gore, and the cave entrance is sealed shut by the collapse of the cave ceiling]"
1318,10,6,Kyle,Hello?
1319,10,6,Stan,Help!
1320,10,6,Kyle,We're trapped in here!
1321,10,6,Cartman,Somebody get us some help down hyah!
1322,10,6,Kyle,"Hello, help!"
1323,10,6,Cartman,Hello??
1324,10,6,Kenny,(Hello!)
1325,10,6,Stan,Help!
1326,10,6,Kyle,Forget it! They can't hear us!
1327,10,6,Kenny,(What are we gonna do??)
1328,10,6,Cartman,"[pointing at Stan] You'd better get us out of here, asshole!"
1329,10,6,Stan,[faces Cartman] Me??
1330,10,6,Cartman,You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we're trapped in a cave!
1331,10,6,Stan,Maybe there's another way out of here.
1332,10,6,Kenny,"(Oh, no kidding.)"
1333,10,6,Kyle,"A-all right, let's split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction. [the boys split up. Kyle climbs along a pile of boulders] Oh man, we're in big trouble here."
1334,10,6,Cartman,"[scrambling along his own path] This is... bullcrap! If I'm thin- I'm gonna be so... pissed off! [loses his footing and slides down some distance to the floor. He gets up and coughs from all the dust that went up around him] Goddammit! [reaches down and grabs his flashlight. He slaps it until it comes back on, coughs, and looks ahead. His eyes grow big. Before him is ""Smuggle's Den,"" a corner of the cave in which sits an open treasure chest and two skeletons guarding it. Gold and jewelry are in and around the chest, while the skeletons have guns in their hands. Cartman approaches slowly, in awe]"
1335,10,6,Kyle,"You see anything, Kenny??"
1336,10,6,Kenny,"(No, nothing!) [Cartman is frozen, speechless]"
1337,10,6,Kyle,"Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??"
1338,10,6,Cartman,"[in a soft, trembling voice] No, nothing [clears his throat and speaks normally] No, nothing here! Nothing this way! [his eyes fixed on the look, he swoons] Tr... treasure."
1339,10,6,Kyle,"Cartman, you okay?? [Cartman snaps out of it] You need help??"
1340,10,6,Cartman,"I'm fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! [turns to head back to the other boys, but turns around one last time to remember where the treasure is, then heads back to his friends.]"
1341,10,6,Kyle,It looks like we're completely sealed in.
1342,10,6,Kenny,"(Yeah, No shit.)"
1343,10,6,Stan,"[returning] There's a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it's pretty steep. [Cartman arrives]"
1344,10,6,Kyle,Maybe we should go for it.
1345,10,6,Cartman,"You guys go on ahead. I'm gonna... stay here, wait it out. [the other three boys turn to face him]"
1346,10,6,Kyle,Why?
1347,10,6,Cartman,"I just... I I don't feel very good. I'll just wa-, I'll just weigh you guys down."
1348,10,6,Stan,Cartman's right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.
1349,10,6,Cartman,"No, it's okay. You guys go on ahead."
1350,10,6,Kyle,"No, we'll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we're gonna get lost or killed. Let's just wait here and hope help comes soon."
1351,10,6,Cartman,That's cool. I just... I just wouldn't go over there [points to his last location] if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.
1352,10,6,Kyle,"Aw, dude! [lifts his jacket over his nose.]"
1353,10,6,Miner 1,The cave-in was massive. It has cut off all access in or out. The children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area. [circles with his index finger an area on the right side of the map]
1354,10,6,Miner 2,Does anybody know who these kids are?
1355,10,6,Miner 1,"No, nobody seems to knew them. Only that they were in the tour group. Digging to them is going to take days."
1356,10,6,Al Gore,"[arrives, interrupting] Excuse me, Excuse me. This cave-in was no accident, and it isn't going to stop unless we move fast! I am super... duper... serial!"
1357,10,6,Miner 1,What do you mean? The cave-in is over.
1358,10,6,Al Gore,I'm afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in.
1359,10,6,Miner 1,What's that? [Gore whips out a drawing of ManBearPig]
1360,10,6,Fireman,"What is that, a pigbearman?"
1361,10,6,Al Gore,"No, stupid! It's ManBearPig!"
1362,10,6,Stan,I'm sooo hungry. Do you think people even know we're here?
1363,10,6,Kyle,"They saw us on the tour. [Cartman comes back from the den] Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?"
1364,10,6,Cartman,"I just... n-need to keep taking a crap. I got diarrhea, really bad."
1365,10,6,Kyle,"Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!"
1366,10,6,Stan,Let's just try to sleep. Maybe help will come tomorrow.
1367,10,6,Cartman,"[softly throughout] All that treasure. [gets excited] It's all mine! [gets angry] So long as these greedy assholes don't find out about it! [looks at the other boys] You would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure, wouldn't you?! Even though I found it, you'd love to think it's somehow yours, too! God, I hate you guys! [begins to crawl towards Kyle] Especially you, you money-grubbing snake in the grass! [reaches Kyle so that his face is smiling evilly down at Kyle's face. He whispers] Well I have news for you, Kyle! You're never going to get my treasure. I've got a little plan going, to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing. [Kyle stirs and wakes up]"
1368,10,6,Kyle,C-Cartman?
1369,10,6,Cartman,"[says nothing for a few seconds, then] Oh. Hey Kyle. How's it goin'?"
1370,10,6,Kyle,"Dude, what are you doing?"
1371,10,6,Cartman,"Not much. You know, just hangin' out. How've you been, man? Good?"
1372,10,6,Kyle,"Dude, get away from me!"
1373,10,6,Cartman,"Yeah. It's nice talking with you, Kyle. See you around. [gets off Kyle]"
1374,10,6,Al Gore,"[whining, stamps his right foot when saying ""serial""] Why won't anybody listen to me?! ManBearPig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance. I'm serial!"
1375,10,6,Miner 3,"Mr. Gore, please, we need you to calm down. Now, w-what exactly do you suggest we do?"
1376,10,6,Al Gore,"I told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead, 'cause it's the only way to make sure ManBearPig never comes out! And I'm sane and I'm totally serial, but everyone just keeps digging!"
1377,10,6,Miner 3,"Well, see, the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead, it will kill those boys too."
1378,10,6,Al Gore,They're already dead! Didn't you listen to me?? They got attacked by a ManBearPig and ManBearPig leaves nobody alive! I'm super serial! Nobody will listen to me but I'm serial! [begins to weep]
1379,10,6,Police Officer,Do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here?
1380,10,6,Miner 2,"Naw, I f- I feel kind of bad for him. I don't think he has any friends."
1381,10,6,Cartman,"[determined] All right. Gotta be strong. [looks at the coins in his hands] There's still a lot more treasure to go. [begins to swallow the coins and wash them down with ""WOTTUR."" He soon runs into some difficulty swallowing and drinking, so it seems like he's puking. The other three boys are awake and listening with concern]"
1382,10,6,Stan,"Dude, he's really sick. [Cartman has moved on to swallowing necklaces and loose gemstones]"
1383,10,6,HBC Reporter,"It's been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in. Three days without food and time is certainly running out. The digging continues, but progress is fatally slow."
1384,10,6,Miner 1,"All right, people, we've gotta work faster! Our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called Smuggler's Den."
1385,10,6,Ranger,Smuggler's Den?
1386,10,6,Tour Guide,"Ih it's a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure. Here, see? [holds up a picture of two kids standing in front of the treasure]"
1387,10,6,Miner 1,"Based on where the boys were seen last, they're somewhere near this area! Hopefully they've followed the first rule of survival and stayed put."
1388,10,6,Kyle,"Stan! Stan, wake up!"
1389,10,6,Stan,[wakes up and rubs his eyes] Huh? What? Have they come for us?
1390,10,6,Kyle,"No, it's Cartman. Something's really wrong with him. [moves off, and Stan follows. Stan shines his light on Cartman, who's now overstuffed with the treasure he's been swallowing. Kenny holds the water bottle Cartman was drinking from]"
1391,10,6,Cartman,"Meh, meuh urgh. [coughs] Mbeuh."
1392,10,6,Stan,"Oh my God. [runs up to Cartman] Cartman? Dude, can you hear me?"
1393,10,6,Cartman,[cough] I'm fahn. Just a lit- [gulp] No big deal. [burps] Beh.
1394,10,6,Kyle,"[taps Stan and takes him aside] We can't wait here any longer! Dude, we've gotta get him out of here or he's gonna die."
1395,10,6,Stan,"How, dude? We c- we don't even know if that passage I found goes anywhere."
1396,10,6,Kyle,Maybe we should get out first. See if we can find a way out and then come back for him.
1397,10,6,Cartman,"NO DON'T! Don't leave me here, you assholes. Don't leave me here to die. [coughs]"
1398,10,6,Kyle,Come on come on! Pull!
1399,10,6,Stan,"Goddamnit, he's soo heavy!"
1400,10,6,Cartman,"Buh. Hurry you guys. You gotta get me out of here. [grunts, and a fart comes out. His face lights up in alarm]"
1401,10,6,Kyle,What the hell is that??
1402,10,6,Stan,Cartman?
1403,10,6,Cartman,"You guys, we've got no time! You gotta get me out!! [the boys pull again.]"
1404,10,6,Al Gore,"This is the end of you, ManBearPig. [releases the boulders onto the river, and the water is diverted towards the cave] Excelsior!"
1405,10,6,Kenny,(We're almost there!)
1406,10,6,Stan,"[exhausted] I can't keep carrying him, dude! I've got no strength!"
1407,10,6,Cartman,"Yes you do! [something drops, and the roar of flooding water is heard]"
1408,10,6,Kyle,"What the hell is that? [the boys turn quickly to see where the sound is coming from, and the wave of water appears. Cartman coughs again. The water rises towards them.] Oh my God. [the boys back up]"
1409,10,6,Cartman,"No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here, you guys!"
1410,10,6,Kyle,"Ruuun! [the boys turn and run from the advancing water, but it overtakes them, sweeping them along]"
1411,10,6,Miner 1,That's it! Pull everyone out! There's nothing more we can do!
1412,10,6,Fireman 2,You're calling off the rescue?
1413,10,6,Miner 1,We didn't plan on a freak river flood. God must really want those kids dead.
1414,10,6,Fireman 2,Well what if the children aren't dead?
1415,10,6,Miner 1,"Look, the cavern is completely flooded. Nothing could have survived. There's nothing left alive down there. [the guide and fireman turn right and walk past Al Gore]"
1416,10,6,Al Gore,"[softly] Nothing left alive... [grins] I did it. I killed ManBearPig. I've saved the earth from certain destruction. Everyone is super-stoked on me, even if they don't know it."
1417,10,6,Stan,"Kenny! Here, take my hand! [Kenny does so and makes it to safety. A change of POV shows Kyle hauling Cartman] Hurry Kyle, the water's rising!"
1418,10,6,Cartman,Grab my hand.
1419,10,6,Kyle,Car... Cartman! You've gotta swim! Kick with your legs!
1420,10,6,Cartman,I can't kick!
1421,10,6,Kyle,Yes you can!
1422,10,6,Cartman,I can't! Kick yourself back to safety!
1423,10,6,Kyle,I need your help!
1424,10,6,Cartman,"No, you just have to save me. [Cartman stops and begins to drop down to the bottom, taking Kyle with him]"
1425,10,6,Stan,Kyle! No!
1426,10,6,Al Gore,"We are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help, but, in the end, could not. But where there is loss, there is hope. For ManBearPig is no more."
1427,10,6,Tour Guide,"Oh Jesus, here we go again. [the mourners hold candles with little paper guards over their hands]"
1428,10,6,Al Gore,"I have beaten ManBearPig, and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives. Kid 1, Kid 2, Kid 3, and of course, Kid 4. [off to the mourners' left, some rocks move and give way to a new opening] I remember how Kid 1 used to laugh and play. [a tour guide notices and watches. The rocks move some more and Stan appears] And how Kid 2 was always there when I needed him."
1429,10,6,Stan,Agh.
1430,10,6,Miner 4,"[jumps out of his seat and stands up] Oh my God! [""Kid 4 was filled with hope and ... terrorism when..."" Stan and Kyle work to pull Cartman out, but it's hard]"
1431,10,6,Miner 1,It's the kids! [everyone rises and runs towards the boys]
1432,10,6,Miner 4,They're alive! [all four of them are out now]
1433,10,6,Al Gore,[walks up to the boys] Kids! I saved you!
1434,10,6,Stan,"Just stay away from us, asshole! I was nice to you because I felt sorry for you, because you don't have any friends! But now I see WHY you don't have any friends! You just used ManBearPig as a way to get attention for yourself because you're a LOSER!!"
1435,10,6,Al Gore,[undaunted] Hyeah right. The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser. [grins. Cartman starts to groan]
1436,10,6,Kyle,We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!
1437,10,6,Cartman,"No! No I'm fine! [begins to walk with difficulty] I just need to get home, a-and rest."
1438,10,6,Stan,"Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor."
1439,10,6,Cartman,[leaving] Noo! I just need to get to a toilet. See you guys. I... [stops] habbeh... HABBEHHHHHHHHHH! [his pants rip open in the read and much of the treasure he had swallowed comes flying out of his body. Then he farts. A long silence follows as everyone looks at him and at the fake treasure he just pooped out]
1440,10,6,Kyle,"Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?"
1441,10,6,Cartman,"It's mine! It's mine, you hear me?! I got it out of the cave; it belongs to me! Keep your greedy hands away!"
1442,10,6,Tour Guide 2,"Hey, that looks like the fake treasure from our Smuggler's Den photo room."
1443,10,6,Cartman,"That's right, and I... [looks at the tour guide] Fake treasure?"
1444,10,6,Tour Guide 2,"Yeah, we put it there for kids to take their picture with. All in all, I'd say that treasure is worth about fourteen dollars."
1445,10,6,Cartman,Noo... NOOO!! [craps out some more treasure] NOO! OW!
1446,10,6,Kyle,You made us pull you to safety because you ate treasure?! You son of a bitch!
1447,10,6,Cartman,"Don't you think I'm hurting enough, Kyle?! Ah, ow!! [craps out even more fake treasure] Dowww!"
1448,10,6,Al Gore,"[now wearing a cape, loosely] Well, my work here is done. I've killed MBP, and now I must save the world from something else. Maybe I'll make a movie. A movie starring me. Then people will take me super-serial. [runs off in superhero pose]"
1449,10,6,Cartman,Eh! [a gold-colored vase pops out of his ass]
1450,10,7,Mr Mackey,"Mrs. Cartman, we have had it with your son's behavior, mkay?! Little Billy Turner is now being treated at the hospital!"
1451,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, why would you do such a thing?"
1452,10,7,Eric Cartman,I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to the school flagpole.
1453,10,7,Mr Mackey,You know that's not the point!
1454,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, I'm sorry I handcuffed Billy Turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw. And then told him I had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg."
1455,10,7,Liane Cartman,"That's very naughty, Eric."
1456,10,7,Eric Cartman,Well he called me chubby!
1457,10,7,Mr Mackey,"We have tried at this school to make Eric understand that there are boundaries, mkay?! But frankly, we believe his behavioral problems start at home!"
1458,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[agreeing] I know. I know he's out of control. But... you don't know what it's like. [reaches into her purse, pulls out a napkin and cries into it] I'm sorry. It's just that... he seems to get worse every day. [crying through her words] He just never listens."
1459,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well nice goin', asshole! You made my mom cry!"
1460,10,7,Liane Cartman,"It's not him, it's you, Eric. [Cartman's anger vanishes] I don't know what to do with you."
1461,10,7,Eric Cartman,Sure you do. You're a great mom.Who's got the greatest mom in the world?I dooo.My mom is number one in my heart.It's true!
1462,10,7,Liane and Eric,"My mom's the best mom, better than your mom.It's singing together in harmony."
1463,10,7,Mr Mackey,"Mrs. Cartman, I know this is extremely difficult but, there is help out there for people like you. Have you ever heard of a show called Nanny 911?"
1464,10,7,Announcer,"They're every parent's worst nightmare. [Two boys are in a bedroom. The older boy jumps around on the bed and throws a blue pillow at the younger one, the younger one cries, gets up, and throws the pillow back at him.]"
1465,10,7,Girl,[in the bathroom with her father] Shut up! I hate you! I hate you! [runs away. Her father is confused]
1466,10,7,Announcer,"Kids completely out of control. [a boy is at the dining table at home, next to a bowl of spaghetti. He picks up the bowl, turns it over, dumps the spaghetti to the floor, and wears the bowl as a hat]"
1467,10,7,Boy,"[drops to the floor and slides around in the spaghetti] Look, I'm skating, I'm skating!"
1468,10,7,Announcer,"It's time to call Nanny 911. [a silhouetted nanny walks in from the left and into the show's coats of arms. Next shot is a camera zooming into NANNY CENTRAL. Inside the manor the nannies are shown: Nanny Stella, Nanny Deb, Nanny Yvonne, and Nanny Skexis] We've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis. [five kids are on a living room sofa. One kid dances around, another repeatedly bangs an object on the floor, two others throw stuff to the floor] Parents of America, help is on the way! [Cartman is shown finger-painting] Tonight..."
1469,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[grabs a can of Red Bull. Several more cans are scattered around, and one of them has tipped over and spilled some drink] Mom, I need another energy drink! [tosses a can away. Next shot, he's in the tub taking a bath and farts. Next shot, he has finished off the tacos his mom served him and takes one of hers without permission.]"
1470,10,7,Announcer,This eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave.
1471,10,7,Eric Cartman,[from his days supporting Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ: pounds the table a few times] Wir mssen die Juden ausrotten!! [his hair gets meesed up from the impacts]
1472,10,7,Announcer,"And Nanny Stella is selected to set him straight. [Stella, a stout blonde, walks toward Cartman's house, and people take second looks at her. She approaches Cartman's front door]"
1473,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"It's time for Nanny Stella to show Eric Cartman his ways are not going to be tolerated anymore! [knocks on the door. Inside, Cartman is playing a video game. Stella knocks again]"
1474,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, are you deaf?! Somebody's at the door!"
1475,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[walks by] Yes. I think it's the nanny, boopsiekins."
1476,10,7,Eric Cartman,Killer. I'm gonna be on TV now. [burps]
1477,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,[Liane answers the door] Hello. I'm Nanny Stella.
1478,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, thank you so much for coming. Please come in. [shows Stella in. Stella walks up to Cartman]"
1479,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,And you must be Eric.
1480,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, I want a Twinkie."
1481,10,7,Liane Cartman,"All, all right dear. [starts walking, but Stella stops her]"
1482,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Hold on, Mrs. Cartman. There are going to be some rule changes around here, Eric. First of all, no video games until chores are done."
1483,10,7,Eric Cartman,[glances up at her] Ha! Hahahahahaha
1484,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,I'm serious. Let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen.
1485,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[mocking her British accent] No thanks, I'd rather naught."
1486,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Right. Then I'm going to have to take it. [takes away the controller, then unplugs and gathers up the rest of the game console]"
1487,10,7,Eric Cartman,The hell do you think you're doing?
1488,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Come on. [leads Liane and Cartman into the kitchen and sets the console down] This video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores. Now, first thing we're going to do is make your bed. [She walks off. Eric simply grabs the console and heads back to the living room, and she returns] Eric, no! This is not acceptable! [takes the console and sets it back on counter]"
1489,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Stop trying to bogart my Xbox, you fat bitch!"
1490,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"All right, that's it! [grabs his hand] You're going to time-out! [leads him away]"
1491,10,7,Eric Cartman,Time out?
1492,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[takes him to a stool and places him on it as Liane watches] Whenever you are naughty, Eric, you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes."
1493,10,7,Eric Cartman,[glances down and thinks] And what exactly keeps me on the stool?
1494,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,It's the time-out stool. You can't get down until the time is up.
1495,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[looks at her, then hops off the stool] Whoa, how did I do that? [walks off to get his X-Box]"
1496,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Eric, you have to stay in time-out!"
1497,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Ummm, no?"
1498,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[approaches him, takes his hands off the console, and takes him back to the stool] Come on, you don't have a choice."
1499,10,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, seriously, you're starting to piss me off now."
1500,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[genuflects and addresses him firmly] Eric, you need to listen to me. [to Liane] This is very important. I am getting down to eye level with Eric so that I can talk to him on his level. [to Eric] Eric, you need to understand why you are being punished. All right?"
1501,10,7,Eric Cartman,I'm just gonna get down as soon as you move.
1502,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Well then, I'll just have to stand right here! [Cartman snorts inward, gathering up a wad of mucus and saliva and spitting it at Stella's mouth] Oh! [Cartman hops off and walks toward his X-Box] He spit in my mouth!"
1503,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Yeah, it's best to avoid his level."
1504,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,All right! I've dealt with this before! We just need to use psychology on him!
1505,10,7,Eric Cartman,[hooks up the X-Box again] Don't stop believing. Hold on to that feeling.
1506,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[genuflects behind him and embraces him] Eric, can I just talk to you for a quick second? Why are you so angry?"
1507,10,7,Eric Cartman,Because you took my Xbox.
1508,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,Is this about more than your video game? Are you feeling angry at me because you think I'm here to change your life?
1509,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, yeah."
1510,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,And you're feeling like I have no right to come in and tell you how to live.
1511,10,7,Eric Cartman,Yeah. I guess so.
1512,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"[to Liane] See this? You have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings. What else are you feeling, Eric?"
1513,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm feeling confused, because I don't understand why you became a nanny."
1514,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Me? Well, it's because I love children, like you."
1515,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Right, but... if you love children so much, how come you're not a mommy?"
1516,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Oh, I just never had kids."
1517,10,7,Eric Cartman,Why not?
1518,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,It... just... didn't happen.
1519,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You're sterile, is that it? [she releases him, taken aback by that question] No, that's too convenient of an excuse. The truth is, nobody ever wanted to have babies with you. Isn't that it? [her jaw drops] Always the mom's maid and never the mom? Must be hard on you, knowing that the years are ticking away, your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away, drying up, becoming totally worthless."
1520,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,"Why you, you... [stands up] you little bastard! How dare you?!"
1521,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, naughty."
1522,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,What kind of [picks him up by the collar] monster would-
1523,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, let the anger come! Strike me down while you can! But it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile! [Stella drops him and steps back a bit]"
1524,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,That's it! [walks up to the camera] I'm not doing this!
1525,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, but we really need some help. [Stella steps back to talk to Liane]"
1526,10,7,Nanny 911 Nanny Stella,Find yourself another nanny... television show!
1527,10,7,Announcer,"Coming up next, it's Super Nanny! Where other nannies fail, Nanny Jo comes through. [a parasol appears in her hand, then the camera pulls back to show three child silhouettes on either side of her. The silhouettes jump up and down]"
1528,10,7,Supernanny Jo,This child's behavior is totally unacceptable!
1529,10,7,Supernanny Jo,"Well, there's no trial too tough for Super Nanny! In just three days' time you're going to see a new Eric Cartman."
1530,10,7,Doctor At Mental Hospital,I'm afraid Super Nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis.
1531,10,7,Liane Cartman,What do you mean?
1532,10,7,Doctor At Mental Hospital,"I mean, [looks into the nanny's room, 23A] she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement. [Liane looks inside through a window. Jo is glued to her toilet seat, eating her own shit.]"
1533,10,7,Supernanny Jo,[Through mouthfuls of poop.] From heeell! It's from heeell!
1534,10,7,Liane Cartman,Oh dear. I don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems. We've been through every nanny reality show on television.
1535,10,7,Doctor At Mental Hospital,Well there... is... one more show you could still try.
1536,10,7,Announcer,"When good dogs go bad, there's one man who's their best friend. Cesar Millan."
1537,10,7,Cesar Millan,"No dog is too much for me to handle. I rehabilitate dogs, I train people. I am the dog wheesperer."
1538,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Please, come in."
1539,10,7,Cesar Millan,So tell me what are the problems you are having with the child?
1540,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Well, he's just... out of control. I mean, he never listens to me, and he pretty much runs my life."
1541,10,7,Cesar Millan,So the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house.
1542,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You can stop talkin' behind my back; I'm right here, fruitcake."
1543,10,7,Cesar Millan,"See I'm not looking at the child, I'm not acknowledging the child, I'm just letting the child know I'm not interested in him."
1544,10,7,Eric Cartman,Not interested I'm me?
1545,10,7,Cesar Millan,"See the child thinks your world revolves around him, because it does. Because everything he does gets a response from you."
1546,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, well I don't see why-"
1547,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1548,10,7,Eric Cartman,Hey!
1549,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Don't look at the child; just keep looking at me. Let, let him know we are having a conversation."
1550,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, this guy doesn't-"
1551,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1552,10,7,Eric Cartman,Ah! Quit it!
1553,10,7,Liane Cartman,What what is it that you're doing?
1554,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck, but it works equally well on a child. I just use two fingers, nip at the child's neck, doesn't hurt the child, just let him know I am dominant."
1555,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Look, Mexican, if you really think that you can-"
1556,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1557,10,7,Eric Cartman,KNOCK IT OFF!
1558,10,7,Cesar Millan,"[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. See, I'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response."
1559,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, that's very interesting."
1560,10,7,Cesar Millan,I think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise. He's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
1561,10,7,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat!
1562,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. -we need to let him burn off. Do you take walks with your son?
1563,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Well, no, I don't."
1564,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Go on, take your son for a walk."
1565,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Ey! You think this is funny, you sonofabitch?"
1566,10,7,Cesar Millan,"See once again, I am the one going for a walk. It's about me, the child is lucky to come along."
1567,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, this is degrading!"
1568,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1569,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Agh! Goddamnit! Aaarrgh! [begins to strain the leash, but can't get loose. He struggles to escape]"
1570,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Don't look at him, just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon. [Cartman tries to get loose from the leash, but Cesar reins him back every time. Cartman starts getting tired.]"
1571,10,7,Eric Cartman,Maaaa. Mommm. [getting hoarse] Mommm.
1572,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Here, why don't you try it now? Take your son. [Liane takes the leash and Cartman goes to her left side]"
1573,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, seriously, people are seeing me!"
1574,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Good. Just keep your confidence, shoulders back, eyes straight ahead. The child can pick up on that confidence, learning he's supposed to follow you, not lead you."
1575,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, don't you love me? Can't you see I'm unhappy right now?"
1576,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cesar is pleased]
1577,10,7,Eric Cartman,Mom!
1578,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Good, Ms. Cartman. Very good!"
1579,10,7,Announcer,"And now, back to the Dog Whisperer."
1580,10,7,Cesar Millan,It is important to understand that dogs run in packs. And one dog is always dominant: the pack leader.
1581,10,7,Eric Cartman,[on the sofa to Liane's left] God dammit stop ignoring me!
1582,10,7,Cesar Millan,You must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy.
1583,10,7,Liane Cartman,Ahall right.
1584,10,7,Eric Cartman,"This is abuse! I am a child, and I am entitled to attention!"
1585,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1586,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Quit it, mom!"
1587,10,7,Liane Cartman,It doesn't seem to work as well when I do it.
1588,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Okay, let me show you how to express the dominant energy. What I have done is I have brought over some Kentucky Fried Chicken. [pulls a bucket of chicken out of the bag. He and Liane walk away from the sofa]"
1589,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Ooo, Colonel?"
1590,10,7,Cesar Millan,"I am going to eat first, because that is what the pack leader does. [Cartman hops down from the sofa and goes to the bucket]"
1591,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Give, give me the chicken. G-give me some chicken."
1592,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1593,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Eh, what are you doing? I want chicken! Give me some Goddamned chicken!"
1594,10,7,Cesar Millan,I am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior. Now you eat the chicken. [hands the bucket to Liane]
1595,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, gimme, give me some chicken; I want some chicken, Mom!"
1596,10,7,Cesar Millan,We won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior.
1597,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[to Cesar] Goddammit, I am not a dog! [turns to Liane and hops up and down like an excited dog] Give me the chicken. Give, give, give me the chicken. I want the chicken! Chicken! [gets shrill] Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken! Give me the chicken!"
1598,10,7,Cesar Millan,[observing Cartman] We need him to become relaxed and submissive.
1599,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Gih- [quiets down] Okay, I'm fine. I'm cool now. May I have some chicken please?"
1600,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, very good, sweetie."
1601,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Oh no, now he's lying. You can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant."
1602,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Suck my asshole, taco vendor!"
1603,10,7,Cesar Millan,See?
1604,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit, you can't stand here and eat KFC in front of me! [to Liane] Now hand it over!"
1605,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1606,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You can't do that to me, I-"
1607,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman sits on the floor]
1608,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Goddamnit, you just can't-"
1609,10,7,Cesar Millan,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman is on his back]
1610,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Seriously! Ey? Eh... [he's now fully on his back, calm]"
1611,10,7,Cesar Millan,I am not being aggressive; I am being dominant.
1612,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Wow, I have a lot to learn."
1613,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[sits up, then stands] Mom, I am serious! This has gone on long enough! Get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken! [Liane ignores him by looking up and away] That's how you want it, bitch?! Fine! [goes upstairs] I hate you! I'm running away!"
1614,10,7,Liane Cartman,Oh dear. [Cartman's bedroom door closes]
1615,10,7,Cesar Millan,"It's okay, this is all part of the dominance struggle."
1616,10,7,Liane Cartman,But what if he does run away.
1617,10,7,Cesar Millan,Let him go. He'll be back. This a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby. [they walk toward the kitchen]
1618,10,7,Butters,"[his turn] Oh boy, Park Avenue! I'm rich! [he and the dealer Stan exchange money through Kyle. Cartman enters]"
1619,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey guys, I've got some pretty big news. [sighs as Kyle takes his turn] I ran away from home. Yeah, my mom just... doesn't care about me anymore, so I moved out. She didn't even try to stop me. It's gonna be tough livin' on my own. But I'll get by, somehow."
1620,10,7,Stan Marsh,[takes his turn] You can't stay here.
1621,10,7,Eric Cartman,Maybe you didn't hear me! I ran away! I don't have anywhere to sleep! I'm out on the street!
1622,10,7,Kyle Broflovski,You'er not staying at my house either.
1623,10,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, that's fine! Butters, I'll crash with you."
1624,10,7,Butters,"No, my parents won't let me bring homeless people home anymore."
1625,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well what do you guys expect me to do?! Stay at Kenny's house?! [Kenny takes his turn] His family's totally poor; I'm not staying with poor people! [play continues] All right, I'll stay with Kenny. Let's go, man."
1626,10,7,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck you.)
1627,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Och! Well, I guess now we see just how supportive friends can be! When the chips are down you won't even lend a hand! I'll just go sleep on the street somewhere! [Butters takes his turn] Out in the cold! Probably get mugged and gang-raped by some minorities! You guys'll be sorry when I turn up dead! [walks out and shuts the front door]"
1628,10,7,Butters,[taking his turn] Whoopie! G and R Railroad!
1629,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Hey Jimmy. You're not gonna believe this, but... I ran away from home. I just... I really need the support of my best friend right now."
1630,10,7,Jimmy Valmer,Who is your best friend?
1631,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You are, Jimmy! We've always been best friends. We know everything about each other."
1632,10,7,Jimmy Valmer,What's my last name?
1633,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[tries to answer, but can't, so he leaves in a huff] Goddammit! [knocks on another door and Craig answers] Craig, dude, I ran away from home. You're the first person I came to. I knew you'd take me in off the streets."
1634,10,7,Craig Tucker,...But I hate you.
1635,10,7,Eric Cartman,...Should that really matter at a time like this?
1636,10,7,Eric Cartman,This is bullcrap! Mom'll break soon. I can outlast her.
1637,10,7,Eric Cartman,"All right, I'm back."
1638,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh Eric, I'm so happy you're home."
1639,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes, well, hopefully you've learned your lesson! I've come back, but there's going to be some changes around here."
1640,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Look what I did, Eric. I learned how to make Sumie paintings. I had almost forgotten how artistic I was."
1641,10,7,Eric Cartman,That's super-interesting. But I've been out living in the streets for almost four hours! Make me something to eat.
1642,10,7,Liane Cartman,Cesar...
1643,10,7,Cesar Millan,How is the painting going?
1644,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Aw, Goddammit!"
1645,10,7,Cesar Millan,Oh look it came back.
1646,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Yup, just like you said he would."
1647,10,7,Eric Cartman,What is he still doing here?!
1648,10,7,Liane Cartman,He said he's hungry. What should I do?
1649,10,7,Cesar Millan,Well let's feed it.
1650,10,7,Eric Cartman,"What the hell is this?! Skinless chicken, boiled vegetables and salad?! This is just like Auschwitz!"
1651,10,7,Cesar Millan,This is more aggressive-dominant behavior. Don't nurture it.
1652,10,7,Eric Cartman,Oh my God. Bite-size Snickers? That's it. I'm calling child-protective services! [gets off and walks to the phone]
1653,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Come on, Ms. Cartman, you must become pack leader. What do you do?"
1654,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, if you don't want to eat then, why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed?!"
1655,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Nooo, you're asking him a favor. Don't ask a favor, dominate! [they walk up to Cartman, who's ready to dial]"
1656,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mom, I want this guy OUT of here! You got it? If he's not gone, in two minutes, I will call social services on you!"
1657,10,7,Cesar Millan,"You project the dominant energy and he will pick up on it. I promise. Shoulder back, head high, don't reason with it, don't argue with it, just dominate it."
1658,10,7,Eric Cartman,"I am your son, and you will listen to me! You have no right to-"
1659,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1660,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Mon, know it off! I'm not gonna stand for th-"
1661,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman drops the receiver and sits on the floor]
1662,10,7,Eric Cartman,Seriously! Mom-
1663,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1664,10,7,Eric Cartman,Seriusly! Why are you... doing this-?
1665,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst. [Cartman is flat on his back]
1666,10,7,Eric Cartman,Mom?!
1667,10,7,Liane Cartman,[pinches him on the neck] Tsst.
1668,10,7,Eric Cartman,Mom? Mom...
1669,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[makes sure Cartman is relaxed, then stands up and turns to Cesar] I did it! [smiles. Cartman doesn't move]"
1670,10,7,Cesar Millan,"You see? You're calm, assertive, and in control. [Cartman walks by, looking defeated, glances at Cesar, then at his mom, then sits by his mom on the sofa and cuddles up to her, a little warily]"
1671,10,7,Liane Cartman,Oh... Oh my gosh!
1672,10,7,Cesar Millan,"See? This is the behavior we've been looking for. This is a relaxed, submissive state."
1673,10,7,Liane Cartman,He's never done this before.
1674,10,7,Cesar Millan,Good. Now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention.
1675,10,7,Liane Cartman,"I love you very much, poopsiekins. You're Mommy's sunshine. [Cartman sniffs]"
1676,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Now you can give him a snack. [Liane offers Cartman a chunk of Candy, which Cartman laps up like a dog] Good, this is really good. Now try a command."
1677,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, I want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth. Then I'll be up to read you a story before bed. [Cartman doesn't do anything at first, then he hops off the sofa and heads for his room, head down] Oh my goodness. I can't believe it."
1678,10,7,Cesar Millan,"This is a great first step, but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident. You are the pack leader now."
1679,10,7,Liane Cartman,I am the pack leader! [grins]
1680,10,7,Cesar Millan,Now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea.
1681,10,7,Liane Cartman,Sounds divine!
1682,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Who does she think telling me to go brush my teeth?! [despite his indignation, he looks compeled to follow orders. He gets up on the stool, gets the toothbrush, turns on the cold water, and gets the toothpaste] Jesus. What's happening to me?"
1683,10,7,Cesar Millan,"So, how is your son doing, Ms. Cartman?"
1684,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he's been amazing, Cesar. He got an A on his last spelling test and a B+ in history. He's losing weight and he's doing what I tell him."
1685,10,7,Cesar Millan,That's greeat!
1686,10,7,Liane Cartman,The best part is I'm not letting him boss me around anymore. I could have never come out and have a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon with a friend before.
1687,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Good, Ms. Cartman, sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend."
1688,10,7,Liane Cartman,"There's just one problem: he still fights me every step of the way. I feel like he's doing what I tell him, but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child."
1689,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Don't worry. When you correct the behavior, eventually you will see a change in the personality."
1690,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh Cesar, I'm so happy to have you in my life. [places her left hand on his right one - closeup shot]"
1691,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Guys, listen up. I really need your help this time. I've thought about it a lot and I've decided I have to kill my mom."
1692,10,7,Butters,Kill your mom?
1693,10,7,Eric Cartman,"She doesn't let me wear whatever I want anymore. Things have really gotten out of hand! My mom must die so I can have a place to live, but without her trying to run my life. She's like Hitler with all the demands she makes."
1694,10,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, have you lost more weight?"
1695,10,7,Eric Cartman,Yes! I've lost almost ten pounds now. You see what I mean?? I totally know how it felt to be a Jew in the Holocaust now! I have to kill my mom. It's my only way out.
1696,10,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, don't kill your mom. That's not cool."
1697,10,7,Eric Cartman,"She's Hitler! Would you have killed Hitler if you had the chance?! [rushes away and gets an easel with some schematics on it] All right now, here's the plan. At 9:45 tonight I will sneak out of my room and leave the house, leaving the back door unlocked. [the plan includes blaming Token for the murder] You guys come into the house at 10:30 p.m. sharp, having given me enough time to get down to Perkins to be seen by everyone there. And then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom."
1698,10,7,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're not killing your mom."
1699,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well I can't kill her. I'm too obvious a suspect. Now, when you reach her room, Butters will keep a lookout while Kenny opens the bedroom door, Kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head, and Stan shoots her in the face."
1700,10,7,Stan Marsh,Where am I supposed to get a gun?
1701,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well I don't know. That's your job, Stan! Do I have to think of everything here?!"
1702,10,7,Stan Marsh,I'm not shooting anybody.
1703,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Okay, fine. Butters, you cover my mom's head with a pillow and Kyle can shoot her in the face."
1704,10,7,Kyle Broflovski,"NO, Cartman!"
1705,10,7,Eric Cartman,Oh! Well how about I do everything?! How does that sound?! I'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games?! [the boys ignore him. He gets pissed off and walks away with the easel] Fine! I'll do it by myself!
1706,10,7,Eric Cartman,"You forced me to do this! You couldn't just love me as a son. [Liane moves a bit] You just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules. I won't let you dominate my life anymore! [he moves the knife to a stabbing position] Goodbye, Mother. [about to deliver the fatal stab, he trembles for a few seconds, but his conscience gets a hold of him. Cartman relaxes a bit]"
1707,10,7,Cartman s Conscience,Wait. Maybe I don't have the right to kill my mom.
1708,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[shakes it off] No! She's my mom, I can do whatever I want with her! It's more important that I live the way I want!"
1709,10,7,Cartman s Good Side,She isn't an object you can own. She's a human being.
1710,10,7,Eric Cartman,She isn't an object I can own. Sh-she's a human being.
1711,10,7,Cartman s Bad Side,"No, she's just... out to make you suffer!"
1712,10,7,Eric Cartman,Ugh. Eh. Maybe all these changes are good for me. Maybe...
1713,10,7,Cartman s Good Side,The world doesn't revolve around me?
1714,10,7,Eric Cartman,"[hops off the bed, dropping the knife and roll of paper as he heads for the door] Maybe the world doesn't revolve around me. [stops and vomits some pretty black stuff. Could be the evil in him]"
1715,10,7,Cartman s Good Side,The world doesn't revolve around me!
1716,10,7,Cartman s Bad Side,"Idiot! [Cartman pounds the floor and gets up. For a moment he turns into a snowy screen, then into a red silhouette, snowy screen, back and forth as he fights his sides leaving his mom's room and going to his. At his door he turns into a blob, which is added to the silhouette and screen effects until he passes out in the hallway]"
1717,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Why Eric, you made your own breakfast."
1718,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah Mom, it's okay. It's grapefruit and lean ham."
1719,10,7,Liane Cartman,And you're studying before school?
1720,10,7,Eric Cartman,"Well, you told me I had to review my homework before class started."
1721,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[a tear escapes her left eye] Oh, Eric. I'm very proud of you."
1722,10,7,Eric Cartman,Tha... thank you?
1723,10,7,Liane Cartman,"I love you, sweetie."
1724,10,7,Eric Cartman,"'K Mom, you're embarrassing me, jeez. [the doorbell rings and Liane goes to answer the door]"
1725,10,7,Liane Cartman,Cesar. I'm so happy you're back.
1726,10,7,Cesar Millan,How is the child doing?
1727,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Oh, he's amazing. I think the change in personality happened. He's doing things for himself now, and he seems to be accepting it. I've lost a best friend, but I've gained a son."
1728,10,7,Cesar Millan,"That's much healthier for him, and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too."
1729,10,7,Liane Cartman,"You're the best, Cesar, and to show my gratitude I've got two tickets for you and me to see Madame Butterfly this Friday night."
1730,10,7,Cesar Millan,"Well no, my work is done. I've got to get back to Los Angeles."
1731,10,7,Liane Cartman,Oh... But I thought we were becoming friends.
1732,10,7,Cesar Millan,"No, not really. You're just a client. Well, good luck to you. Gotta go. [turns around and walks away. Cartman shows up soon after]"
1733,10,7,Eric Cartman,"I cleared up the table, Mom. I'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now. [waits a bit, then turns to go to his room. Liane turns around]"
1734,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Eric, how would you like to go with me to see Madame Butterfly Friday night?"
1735,10,7,Eric Cartman,"No, that's okay. Besides, I told Stan and Kyle we could work on our science project then."
1736,10,7,Liane Cartman,"Well, what if I took you to Kentucky Fried Chicken afterward? [Cartman blinks, Liane genuflects] And then we'll go to Target and buy you a Mega Ranger."
1737,10,7,Eric Cartman,Could I... perhaps have... two Mega Rangers?
1738,10,7,Liane Cartman,"[hugs him] Yes, darling. You can have whatever you want. [A beatific smile appears on Cartman's face as foreboding music plays.]"
1739,10,8,Eric Cartman,"[as the dwarf, with mallet] Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?"
1740,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[voice only] We're over here, by the cart. [POV switches to three other characters - a blue knight, a green lady, and an orange knight stand around waiting for the dwarf. The dwarf walks into the group]"
1741,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, I'm back."
1742,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[the blue knight, with sword and shield] Dude! We've been waiting forever!"
1743,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!"
1744,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[the green lady with big breasts] If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!"
1745,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!"
1746,10,8,Kenny McCormick,"[mumbles, then] (I think Kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)"
1747,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Heheh, totally, heheh."
1748,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. [walks off, and the others follow]"
1749,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[voice only] Stan? [Stan stops] Stan?
1750,10,8,Stan Marsh,"H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something."
1751,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stan!
1752,10,8,Stan Marsh,What?!
1753,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[displeased] You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
1754,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[swivels around to face his dad] I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak."
1755,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[stares, then gets dejected] ...I'm not a r-tard. [turns and leaves. Stan returns to his game]"
1756,10,8,Stan Marsh,"All right, sorry guys. So where to now?"
1757,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"See where I am? It's this way. [Stan joins the group. Kyle's character turns around, realizes its mistake, and jumps back around]"
1758,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, come on, let's go! [the four now walk abreast] I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!"
1759,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, look at all these people playing right now."
1760,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans."
1761,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[stops and motions] Oh crap! It's that guy again! [a player approaches them and begins to dance. The character is wearing a helmet, boots, elbow-length gloves, and tight shorts. No shirt, no other armor]"
1762,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Who is this?
1763,10,8,Stan Marsh,This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
1764,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Get out of here, asshole!"
1765,10,8,Stan Marsh,He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
1766,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. [the ganker jabs at Kenny, who immediately dies.]"
1767,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!"
1768,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[in a soft feminine voice, makes a fist and holds it up for emphasis] You bastard! [the ganker stabs Kyle and then Stan, who both drop and die]"
1769,10,8,Eric Cartman,Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?! [the ganker begins generating power] No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard! [the ganker shoots a fireball at Cartman] No! [the fireball hits and Cartman falls face down and dies.]
1770,10,8,Eric Cartman,That sonofabitch!
1771,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Who is that guy?
1772,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[head resting on left hand] Whoever he is, he is one tough badass."
1773,10,8,Rep,[female] World of Warcraft support line.
1774,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!"
1775,10,8,Rep,O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other.
1776,10,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
1777,10,8,Eric Cartman,He's a God damned butthole!
1778,10,8,Rep,Really? That's odd. [her co-worker approaches. She muffles the mic to talk to him] More people calling in about their characters getting killed. [removes her hand]
1779,10,8,Co Worker,Oh no.
1780,10,8,Rep,"Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network. [She muffles the mic] Better tell the guys upstairs."
1781,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players.."
1782,10,8,Member 1,Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.
1783,10,8,Member 2,We've got to delete him from the servers.
1784,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to kill our admins. And he grows stronger every day."
1785,10,8,Member 3,Jesus...
1786,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",[rises from his chair] I've gotta get home! My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!
1787,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Jim, your kids' characters are already dead."
1788,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",No... [sinks back into his seat] No... [frustrated] They just started playing!
1789,10,8,Member 2,What kind of person would do this?
1790,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","[walks back to the end of the table, by the doors] Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...haw absolutely no life."
1791,10,8,Member 3,How do you kill...that which has no life? [the question hangs there for a long time...]
1792,10,8,Nelson,"[walks into view] Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?"
1793,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together."
1794,10,8,Nelson,[walks up to Randy's desk] Is that a computer game?
1795,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2. [he moves his blond character around] I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see? [demonstrates.] ""Hello."" [the character waves back] In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. [the griefer returns and stabs Falcorn in the back, killing him, then walks away]"
1796,10,8,Nelson,Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. [turns around and walks away]
1797,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,What?? Why?? Why?!
1798,10,8,Eric Cartman,"My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters."
1799,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!"
1800,10,8,Craig Tucker,He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!
1801,10,8,Tweek Tweak,Mine too!
1802,10,8,Eric Cartman,"We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance."
1803,10,8,Token Black,Hey yeah!
1804,10,8,Jimmy Valmer,We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
1805,10,8,Clyde Donovan,"Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time."
1806,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we have to try."
1807,10,8,Clyde Donovan,I've got better things to do.
1808,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde! [moves around his podium to talk to Clyde more directly] If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it? [beat] I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?"
1809,10,8,Clyde Donovan,[unshaken] I'm just gonna stop playing.
1810,10,8,Eric Cartman,"When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?"
1811,10,8,Clyde Donovan,No.
1812,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?"
1813,10,8,Clyde Donovan,"All right all right, I'll do it!"
1814,10,8,Jimmy Valmer,So what's the p-plan?
1815,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30. [walks up to a map of their quest] We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!"
1816,10,8,All,To victory!
1817,10,8,Butters Stotch,I don't play World of Warcraft.
1818,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!"
1819,10,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure."
1820,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you."
1821,10,8,Butters Stotch,"O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then."
1822,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff."
1823,10,8,Token Black,[playing a black warrior] Okay.
1824,10,8,Craig Tucker,Got it.
1825,10,8,Eric Cartman,"The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards."
1826,10,8,Jimmy Valmer,"All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us."
1827,10,8,Timmy Burch,Timmy!
1828,10,8,Eric Cartman,This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth! [another dwarf walks in looking just like Cartman's dwarf] From with-
1829,10,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey fellas! [Cartman's dwarf looks over] Boy, this is neato, huh?"
1830,10,8,Eric Cartman,Butters? What the hell are you doing?
1831,10,8,Butters Stotch,"I got World of Warcraft, like you said."
1832,10,8,Eric Cartman,"You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf."
1833,10,8,Butters Stotch,"Well, there's only like four races to choose from-"
1834,10,8,Eric Cartman,"So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!"
1835,10,8,Butters Stotch,[walks off grumbling] I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
1836,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's do this!"
1837,10,8,Jason White,"Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30."
1838,10,8,Eric Cartman,[turns around and leads] Then let's move out! [the others charge after him]
1839,10,8,Stan Marsh,Look! There he is!
1840,10,8,Eric Cartman,Everyone hold! [everyone stops in their tracks. The ganker turns around and faces them.]
1841,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,He's targeting us.
1842,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click! [that sends the group charging at the ganker, who responds by summoning an army of giant scorpions] What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! [the actual rogue player is shown in his apartment, leaning back on his chair and playing without needing to think very much about what to do next. His character and scorpions decimate the group]"
1843,10,8,Tweek Tweak,"Aaaa! [his character runs all over the place, with no one offering to smother him and put out the flames] I'm burning! Oh Jesus I'm burning! [a scorpion kills another character nearby]"
1844,10,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down. [Tweek is still burning, running around]"
1845,10,8,Ike Broflovski,[purple mage] I have poop on my pants.
1846,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, look out! [the ganker rushes in and stabs him, and Ike is out of the game. Stan runs through a group of scorpions]"
1847,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow! [Clyde's character looks like he's about to swing at a baseball] Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde! [Clyde is at his computer, but not participating in the game. He's looking at Playboy centerfolds.] Clyde! Clyde, you asshole! [rushes to join the others] Goddammit we lost Clyde!"
1848,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? [Stan's character turns around]"
1849,10,8,Stan Marsh,Dad??
1850,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, I'm playing from the office."
1851,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, get off our teamspeak line!"
1852,10,8,Token Black,"[the ganker kills him] That's it, I'm dead!"
1853,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[the ganker kills him. He throws off his headset again] That's it, screw this game!"
1854,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Now, leave me alone, don't do- [the ganker electrocutes Cartman with his dagger through the mallet] that, dugh [Cartman dies, and the ganker skips away. Cartman screams into his mic, then throws down his headset] God-fucking-dammit!!! [meanwhile, in his apartment, the ganker just keeps plugging along.]"
1855,10,8,Member 3,Oh Jesus...Oh God no...
1856,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",What?
1857,10,8,Member 3,He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands.
1858,10,8,Member 1,How many people's characters were in there?
1859,10,8,Member 2,Over five thousand. [some of the members sit down. Member 1 rises]
1860,10,8,Member 1,"There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them?"
1861,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft."
1862,10,8,Member 5,[grabs his head] No! Nooooooooo!
1863,10,8,Eric Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
1864,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time."
1865,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft."
1866,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times."
1867,10,8,Eric Cartman,"I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?"
1868,10,8,Stan Marsh,We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
1869,10,8,Eric Cartman,"That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars."
1870,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Boars?
1871,10,8,Eric Cartman,There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
1872,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?"
1873,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes. [whips out a sheet full of calculations] Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around, [firmly] or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters."
1874,10,8,Paul Stanley,"Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes!Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall!Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winYeah! [...and back into night...Stan's first pimples appear and his face is fatter.]Live! [More pimples appear, and his hair begins to look matted]Yeah!Win! [He's gotten fatter than Cartman normally is, to the point where he's too fat to wear his jacket anymore]''"
1875,10,8,Member 3,"Sir, you'd better have a look at this! Four of our subscribers...They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks."
1876,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",My God...they must have no lives at all.
1877,10,8,Member 3,A hope?
1878,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",A chance.
1879,10,8,Paul Stanley,"Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyesLive to win, take it all, just keep fighting 'till you fall<p>Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winLive to winLive to winYeah, win"
1880,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts."
1881,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!"
1882,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado.
1883,10,8,Member 1,Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?
1884,10,8,Member 5,"[wearing a black T-shirt with the green words ""Dwarf Needs FOOD!"" on it] We ran the numbers: even with their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter!"
1885,10,8,Member 1,There has to be...someway we can help them.
1886,10,8,Member 6,What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths?
1887,10,8,Member 7,"Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to speak of that sword!"
1888,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.
1889,10,8,Member 7,It is not an option!
1890,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",What is this sword?
1891,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80."
1892,10,8,Member 7,But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.
1893,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves."
1894,10,8,Member 1,Who foretold this prophecy?
1895,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",Soltzman. He's an accountant.
1896,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths. [the flash drive gets its close-up] We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them."
1897,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!"
1898,10,8,Stan Marsh,I'm in.
1899,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
1900,10,8,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
1901,10,8,Eric Cartman,"[begins to slur his speech ever so slightly, giving it a blas feel] Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence."
1902,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range."
1903,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?"
1904,10,8,Stan Marsh,+15 agility.
1905,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks."
1906,10,8,Stan Marsh,'K.
1907,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?"
1908,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, I have that covered. [pressed a button on a small intercom on his desk] Mom?"
1909,10,8,Liane Cartman,Yes hon?
1910,10,8,Eric Cartman,More Hot Pockets!
1911,10,8,Liane Cartman,"[answering at the other end] Right away, hon. [Cartman turns it off]"
1912,10,8,Stan Marsh,That's bercool.
1913,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, everyone ready?"
1914,10,8,Kyle Stan,Ready.
1915,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Let's go get him! [the battle begins. The rogue is playing with the right hand, eating a cookie with the left.]"
1916,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire."
1917,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan."
1918,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,What's the autolocate macro?
1919,10,8,Eric Cartman,Command-0. [sniffs]
1920,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, right behind Stan."
1921,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout."
1922,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us."
1923,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle."
1924,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
1925,10,8,Eric Cartman,Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
1926,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage."
1927,10,8,Eric Cartman,Christ...
1928,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cast on him again.
1929,10,8,Eric Cartman,Everyone target scorpions.
1930,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Yes?
1931,10,8,Member 1,We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge.
1932,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.
1933,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",Where is he?!
1934,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Who are you?
1935,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle!"
1936,10,8,Member 1,"Unless they have this sword, [pulls out the flash drive] your son's character is going to die!"
1937,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[close-up, Randy's eyes widen] Nn-Oh my God! [drops his coffee cup and runs upstairs. The two other men look at each other and follow]"
1938,10,8,Eric Cartman,Kyle! Fire spell!
1939,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aaaa... [starts generating the spell, but it abruptly goes out] AH! Huh?! [his character grabs her right wrist with her left hand]"
1940,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle! [Kyle leaves his desk grabbing onto his right hand, then flexes his right wrist around. Stan leaves his desk and approaches him] Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?"
1941,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! [pain shoots through his wrist as he continues flexing his wrist and stretching his fingers]
1942,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! [Cartman walks over]"
1943,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Wait, we need Ben-Gay. [waddles to Kenny's desk desk and pulls out a tube of the stuff, then walks back and squirts some of it onto Kyle's right wrist, then rubs it in.]"
1944,10,8,Stan Marsh,Hurry dude!
1945,10,8,Eric Cartman,I'm going as fast as I can!
1946,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, you have to keep playing."
1947,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,I can't. Just leave me behind.
1948,10,8,Stan Marsh,We can't do this without you now! Come on! [he and Cartman help Kyle back to his computer]
1949,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Stan?! Stan! [turns around and sees Sharon walk by with the laundry] Sharon, where is Stan?!"
1950,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.
1951,10,8,Member 1,Stupid?
1952,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Where?!
1953,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,I don't know.
1954,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!"
1955,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,So what?
1956,10,8,The three men,So what?! [Sharon rolls her eyes and walks away]
1957,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail.
1958,10,8,Member 1,"Ih if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online."
1959,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you?
1960,10,8,Member 1,"No, I have a life. [the men fall silent]"
1961,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Give me the sword.
1962,10,8,Member 1,You?
1963,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online."
1964,10,8,Member 1,We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!
1965,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword. [Member 1 kneels and reverently gives the USB drive to Randy. Randy holds it above his head like an actual sword] Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! [runs out of the house with the other two men behind him]"
1966,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Where's your car?
1967,10,8,Member 1,We took a cab here!
1968,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Dammit, mine's in the shop! [runs out into the street] Uh hey! Eh help! Stop! [a car slows down] Please, it's an emergency! [the driver opens his door, Randy yanks him out and knocks him out with one punch. Randy and the other two men get in the car and speed away. The driver comes to and looks on. Randy is now on his cell phone] Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!"
1969,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh..."
1970,10,8,Stan Marsh,"You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!"
1971,10,8,Eric Cartman,It's okay. [clicks on the intercom] Mom? Bathroom!
1972,10,8,Liane Cartman,What hon?
1973,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Bathroom! Bathroom! [clicks off. A second later Liane goes into the basement with a bedpan. Cartman sense this and lowers his pants as Liane positions the bedpan in place. Cartman lets go and a log comes out first, followed by a spattering stream of crap. Some of it ends up on the floor, some of it on Liane's blouse. Nasty.]"
1974,10,8,Liane Cartman,"Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? [walks away with the poop. Cartman lifts his pants back in place without cleaning his ass]"
1975,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow."
1976,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,World of Warcraft! I need to play!
1977,10,8,Best Buy Greeter,Our demo is set up right over by the- [Randy runs to the demo. A small boy is playing the game. Randy shoves him off and logs him out.]
1978,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! [puts on the headset]"
1979,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I'm almost dead."
1980,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, cast arcane missile!"
1981,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm out of mana, I told you."
1982,10,8,Stan Marsh,[his character leaves the battle] I've gotta heal. [his character turns to see the battle]
1983,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Staaan! [Stan's character looks around trying to determine where the voice is coming from, then turns around]"
1984,10,8,Stan Marsh,Dad? Not now!
1985,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this. [holds the Sword of a Thousand Truths aloft] This sword can completely drain his mana.
1986,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, how did you get that?!"
1987,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"No time! Just take it! Here! [the sword stays fixed to his left hand] ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?"
1988,10,8,Stan Marsh,Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
1989,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Okay. [The ganker notices the lull in action and faces Stan. Cartman is alarmed and spins around to look at Stan.]
1990,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Stan, what the hell are you doing?! [the ganker runs and leaps toward Stan and Randy]"
1991,10,8,Stan Marsh,I got it! [the ganker stabs Randy and Randy goes down]
1992,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Augh!
1993,10,8,Stan Marsh,Dad!
1994,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stan... [falls down face first]
1995,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, no! [turns around to face the ganker] You killed my father. [walks up to the ganker and strikes him with one blow of the sword. The ganker's defenses start to crack.]"
1996,10,8,Eric Cartman,His shield and armor spells are down!
1997,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Attack! [Kenny quickly takes his bow and arrow and fires an arrow into the ganker's chest. Kyle fires an energy ball at the ganker. The energy ball knocks the knife from the ganker's hand and disables him some more. He falls to the ground on all fours, and the dwarf approaches him, ready to smash the ganker's head in with the mallet]"
1998,10,8,Eric Cartman,Looks like you're about to get pwned. [swings back and then pulls the mallet forward] Heeyeah! [the mallet smashed the ganker's head into little bloody pieces.]
1999,10,8,Stan Marsh,Dad? Dad?
2000,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[answers] Staaan. [falters a bit, but Stan holds him up] I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son."
2001,10,8,Stan Marsh,"I know you do, Dad."
2002,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[swats Stan's hand away] Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
2003,10,8,Member 1,They did it!
2004,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",Our world is saved! [Randy smiles]
2005,10,8,Man 1,They did it! They killed him! [leaves his hiding place. Others follow]
2006,10,8,Man 2,They did it!
2007,10,8,Woman,They killed him! We can come out!
2008,10,8,Eric Cartman,Yes!
2009,10,8,Stan Marsh,We did it!
2010,10,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
2011,10,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
2012,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah yeah.
2013,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, yay."
2014,10,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo! Oh man!)
2015,10,8,Eric Cartman,We did it you guys. We're totally heroes.
2016,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,That was such ber pwnage
2017,10,8,Stan Marsh,I can't believe it's all over. What do we do now?
2018,10,8,Eric Cartman,What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game.
2019,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Oh yeah.
2020,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay Kenny, add Eyes of the Beast to your hotbar. Stan, check your fury talents to boost your shots."
2021,10,8,Stan Marsh,Got it.
2022,10,9,Mrs Garrison,"And so, class, that is when Joe Lee countered back to Aniston and said things like- [the door opens and Mr. Mackey enters the classroom, looking quite pissed. Mr. Mackey walks by Mrs. Garrison without saying a word] Oh hello, Mr. Mackey."
2023,10,9,Mr Mackey,"[faces the class] All the girls go out in the hall please? I need to speak with the boys of this class, m'kay? [the girls leave their seats and go into the hall] Boys, we have a very serious problem! I've just come from the men's restroom, and somebody went number 2 in the urinal! [Mrs. Garrison's jaw drops at the behavior, then she gets concerned. The boys just blink at Mr. Mackey]"
2024,10,9,Butters Stotch,What's a urinal?
2025,10,9,Stan Marsh,A wall toilet for peeing in.
2026,10,9,Mr Mackey,"And some jokester took a poop in it! Okay? Now I want whoever did it to come forward right now, and it will be less painful for everybody! M'kay?!"
2027,10,9,Jimmy,Who would take a d-dump in a urinal? It's such a s-senseless crime.
2028,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Mackey, I think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy, just like 9/11."
2029,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, here we go again! 9/11 was not a conspiracy, fatass!"
2030,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh really?! Do you just believe everything you're told, Kyle?"
2031,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Excuse me!! Could we get back to the issue, please?! You all don't seem to understand how serious this is!! Now who made dookie in the urinal?! [the boys just laugh] Oh, you think it's funny, huh?! M'kay! M'kay! You're gonna think it's real funny when the police get here!"
2032,10,9,Officer 1,"I'm sorry, Mr. Mackey, but there just isn't really any evidence to go on."
2033,10,9,Mr Mackey,But there must have been some motive. Nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason.
2034,10,9,Officer 1,But who would benefit from crapping in the urinal? Uh this is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
2035,10,9,Narrator,The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in: [the cover of book 37 is shown] The Mystery of the Urinal Turd.
2036,10,9,Officer 1,"So, that's it, Hardly Boys, we've got no leads and nobody admitting to the crime."
2037,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",That sure is a mystery.
2038,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Yeah, it sounds super-hard."
2039,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Whoever did it must have been angry with the school. Oh... Oooo... I think I'm getting a clue.
2040,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",F-really?
2041,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Yeah, this is totally giving me a clue right now."
2042,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",[turns to Frank] Oh... I'm starting to get a clue too.
2043,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",My clue is kind of pointing this way.
2044,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","[moves to his left, to where Frank's clue is pointing] Ohhgh. Yeah, now I've got a total clue."
2045,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",I've still got a raging clue.
2046,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",[turns right] My clue's pointing over there now!
2047,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Oh, let's follow that clue! [move off to the right and away from the boys' room.]"
2048,10,9,Stan Marsh,Did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet?
2049,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Not yet.
2050,10,9,Eric Cartman,"They aren't going to find out who did it. But they'll make up a scapegoat, send him to detention, and make us all believe it. It'll be 9/11 all over again."
2051,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Will you shut up about 9/11!
2052,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, why are you so afraid of the truth?!"
2053,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Because anybody who thinks 9/11 was a conspiracy is a retard!
2054,10,9,Eric Cartman,Oh really? Well did you know that over one-fourth of people in America think that 9/11 was a conspiracy? Are you saying that one-fourth of Americans are retards?
2055,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yes. I'm saying one-fourth of Americans are retards.
2056,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, at least one-fourth."
2057,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's take a test sample: There's four of us, you're a retard, that's one-fourth."
2058,10,9,Eric Cartman,"...There are soo many people who know the truth, Kyle. Uh Butters! [sees Butters walking towards the group]"
2059,10,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey, fellas!"
2060,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Butters, do you think 9/11 was just a plot by some angry terrorists, or do you think there was some kind of coverup?"
2061,10,9,Butters Stotch,"Well, I heard that 9/11 was caused by President Bush."
2062,10,9,Eric Cartman,Aha! Do you see?
2063,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where did you hear that?
2064,10,9,Butters Stotch,[points] From Eric.
2065,10,9,Eric Cartman,I rest my case.
2066,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[walks up and stands next to Butters] Butters, you don't really believe that, do you?"
2067,10,9,Butters Stotch,"Well, l-uh, I mean, uh, you never know. Uh, the government does some pretty spooky things. The government and the corporations headed by the Jews that tear down 9/11."
2068,10,9,Eric Cartman,"That's right, Butters."
2069,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Goddamnit, you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap, fatass?"
2070,10,9,Eric Cartman,What? People see the truth?
2071,10,9,Butters Stotch,Can I go now?
2072,10,9,Eric Cartman,You guys are blind! I can't believe that everyone here is just buying into what they're told by the media! [begins to move away from the boys] I'm gonna go find out the truth. I'm gonna blow the lid off this whooole 9/11 conspiracy once and for all! [goes around a corner and disappears]
2073,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rolls his eyes] Oh no...
2074,10,9,Eric Cartman,"It is wrong for me to ask questions?Is it wrong to seek the truth?I just can't blindly accept their version.I can't base my logic on proof.Almost all the evidence points one way,But I'm like Charlie Sheen and Gloria Estefan:I need to know what really happenedOn 9/11-leven-leven-leven-leven.What really happenedOn 9/11?[He's back at his computer once more and clicks on his mouse]Of course. It's so obvious. How did we not see it before?"
2075,10,9,Leroy,"This is my frog.  He doesn't have a name. He's a frog not a toad because toads don't ribbit. I think frogs are good pets. [he gets a smattering of applause from the other kids, then goes back to his seat]"
2076,10,9,Mrs Garrison,"Okay, thank you, Leroy, thanks for sharing your dumb little frog with the class. Okay, anybody else have anything for Show and Tell?"
2077,10,9,Eric Cartman,"[raises and waves his hand] Uh! Erh, eh. Uhhh!"
2078,10,9,Mrs Garrison,"All right, Eric, you can go next."
2079,10,9,Eric Cartman,[leaves his seat and goes to the front of the class with his laptop.] For Show and Tell today I have brought... [puts on some glasses] ...my shocking Powerpoint report on the truth!.. [removes the glasses for dramatic effect] behind the 9/11 attacks! [the lights go out and a projector is turned on]
2080,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[rolls his eyes] Oh Christ...
2081,10,9,Eric Cartman,"[his first image is that of the Twin Towers] We are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers, [the image gets animated as a cross-section of a wall is picked apart and the steel girders shown, which led to their collapse.] which led to their collapse. But did you know jet fuel doesn't burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel? [the other kids look at each other. Kyle's eyes are half-closed, showing his disinterest] We were told the Pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well, [a picture of the Pentagon with the damage clearly visible. A helicopter hovers nearby] but now look at this photo of the Pentagon. The hole is not nearly big enough. And if a plane hit it, where is the rest of the plane?"
2082,10,9,Clyde Donovan,Whoa...
2083,10,9,Eric Cartman,"So now, the inevitable question: if terrorists didn't cause 9/11, who did? [he begins to use his fingers to show the numbers as he says them] Remember that there are in fact two towers. Two minus one is one; one one - 11; two minus one is one; one one, and there are nine members on Silverstein's board of directors. That's nine-one-one. Nine-eleven. And take 2 - 1 + 9/11 and you get 12, which leads us all to the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. [click. Kyle now appears superimposed on the 9/11 picture already onscreen]. Kyle!"
2084,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Me??!
2085,10,9,Eric Cartman,"Twelve contains the numbers one and two, just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one! And one and two with 911 and you get 914! Drop the 4 and it's 91! Exactly the score Kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 9/11! Who has the most to gain from 9/11?! Kyle! Who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell?! Kyle! Who dropped the deuce in the urinal?! Kyle! But probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of Tower 2! [clicks, and another shot of the Twin Towers is shown] When I zoomed in I saw what first appeared to be a blur, [he zooms in on the picture, which just becomes pixilated] but when I computer-enhanced it, [the pixilation disappears as the picture sharpens - it's a drawing of an evil Kyle with a large, sharp knife in his right hand] You almost got away with it, you sneaky butthole."
2086,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Token. [Token does not respond, but just watches him walk by. Kyle stops by Butters and Craig] You-you gonna watch the game tonight, Butters? [Butters is suddenly scared]"
2087,10,9,Butters Stotch,Waaaah! [drops his book and runs away. The other kids just stare at Kyle]
2088,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, all right, I was not responsible for 9/11! [the other kids move away quickly] God-damnit!"
2089,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Hello bubbe, how was school today?"
2090,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[stops in front of Sheila, to her left] Terrible."
2091,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, come on, school isn't all that bad."
2092,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"But, everyone thinks I was responsible for 9/11."
2093,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat?!
2094,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,We have to do something! It is obvious our children are still completely confused about 9/11!
2095,10,9,Principal Victoria,"Yes, we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened."
2096,10,9,Skeeter,"Well, what really happened? There's strong evidence that what we were told isn't the truth."
2097,10,9,Other men,"Oh no, oh brother, oh God."
2098,10,9,Mr Adler,[stands up] That's right. Did you know that there were explosions seen at the base of the towers?
2099,10,9,Other men,"Oh no, oh God, that's so retarded."
2100,10,9,Mr Mackey,"[stands up] Look, what-ever you believe, the fact of the matter is somebody... dropped a dookie in the school urinal, and there's still no explanation for that!"
2101,10,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Mr. Mackey, there are more important things going on here!"
2102,10,9,Mr Mackey,"More important?! You aren't the one, who had to walk into the boys' bathroom, okay, after having tuh, to wake up early, you know, there's no, no coffee in the teachers' lounge, and then you, you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal! Like it's laughin' at you!"
2103,10,9,Jimbo Kern,He's right! The turd could have been put there to cover up 9/11!
2104,10,9,Mr Mackey,"No, I'm not saying they're related!"
2105,10,9,Randy Marsh,[rises] How do we know they're not? We need to be brave enough to ask questions! [makes a fist]
2106,10,9,Skeeter,"It's obvious that before we go any further, we need to find out who was behind 9/11 once and for all!"
2107,10,9,Richard Tweak,Who else could it have been?
2108,10,9,Det Yates,This is too big a mystery for me. I think we'd better call in the Hardly Boys.
2109,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Oh no, not the Goddamned-"
2110,10,9,Narrator,The Hardly Boys. Two young whippersnappers with a knack for solving mysteries. The Hardly Boys in: [the cover of a new book is shown] The Case of the World Trade Center Conspiracy.
2111,10,9,Det Yates,"So that's about the long and short of it, Hardly Boys. There were two towers that stood right here, [shows off the question mark] and they're gone."
2112,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",And nobody knows who's responsible?
2113,10,9,Det Yates,"There are theories, but, nobody's certain."
2114,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Nnnn, who would benefit most from two buildings disappearing?"
2115,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Ooo... oh, I just started getting a clue."
2116,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Really?
2117,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Yeah, I'm totally getting a clue."
2118,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Oh... Oh, that's giving me a clue. Yeah, ye-yeah, I've got a raging clue right now."
2119,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Mine's pointing to the left.
2120,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Oh F-, oh Frank, seriously, I have such a raging clue right now, I think we'd better follow it."
2121,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","Okay, let's follow your raging clue."
2122,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Oofff.
2123,10,9,Randy Marsh,[watches them walk away] Godspeed.
2124,10,9,Stan Marsh,[appears suddenly in the living room] Kyle!
2125,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[jumps] Aaaah!
2126,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, do you mind telling me why CIA guys [looks around] are coming to my house and questioning me about you??"
2127,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I don't know, dude. It's like everyone's putting pieces together that aren't there."
2128,10,9,Stan Marsh,Well why did you have to involve me??
2129,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's not my fault.
2130,10,9,Stan Marsh,"All right, look, I've been doing a lot of research on the Web and I found an organization who says they can prove you weren't involved in 9/11."
2131,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Really?
2132,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Come on. We'll go out the back so they don't see you. [moves off, then stops and turns around] There's just one thing I need to know before we go: you weren't responsible for 9/11, right?"
2133,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,......Dude.
2134,10,9,Stan Marsh,[mulls it over] That's all I needed. [turns around and heads for the back door. Kyle follows.]
2135,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Now you might all think I've given up finding out who crapped in the urinal. M'kay? And maybe, maybe you think it's a victimless crime. This, is Mr. Venezuela [walks up to a school janitor, who's a Latino with mop and bucket in hand], the school janitor. Okay? [the fourth graders are shown with some kindergartners in front of them] He's the person... who has to clean up... when some trickster... drops a dook in the wrong toilet! Mr. Venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best! Okay? He's got three kids at home, he's got a car that barely works, he's gotta clean up puke with sawdust, m'kay, then he walks into the boys' room and sees a big meaty chud starin' him in the face! [the sixth graders are shown seated to the left of the fourth graders] So when you crapped in that urinal, m'kay, you might as well have just dropped your pants, and laid a turd right on top of Mr. Venezuela's head! [the kids laugh] Oh, you think it's funny, huh?!"
2136,10,9,Mrs Garrison,Mr. Mackey! [he and Principal Victoria enter the gym] We got him.
2137,10,9,Mr Mackey,Huh?
2138,10,9,Mrs Garrison,We caught the person that did it.
2139,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Hi, we were hoping you can help us. My friend is being blamed for 9/11."
2140,10,9,Man from 911truth.org,"[wearing a 911truth.org T-shirt] Aw geez. Come on in, kids. [the boys enter. A model of the towers stands on the coffee table while the computer displays a 9/11 Web page. The rest of the office is littered with 9/11 stuff] It doesn't surprise me. More and more people are being blamed for 9/11 every day."
2141,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,They are?
2142,10,9,911truth Man,"Yeah, it a way of keeping people from seeing the real evidence. I know it seems crazy, but 9/11 was pulled off by our own government, so they could gain support for attacking the Middle East."
2143,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,What? No no no.
2144,10,9,911truth Man,I know it's hard to believe.
2145,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, why would the government attack its own buildings?"
2146,10,9,911truth Man,It's called the False Flag policy. Make it look like the enemy attacked you. Get all your citizens riled up and waving American flags. Then you're free to invade any country you want.
2147,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,...That's retarded.
2148,10,9,911truth Man,[sits at his computer and starts typing away] Look into the evidence of 9/11 and you'll see there are a lot of holes in their story.
2149,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,There's a lot of holes in the Theory of Evolution too; it doesn't mean it's wrong.
2150,10,9,911truth Man,"You don't understand! The government controls everything. The media, the corporations, they have the power to do anything they want. Here, look! [grabs two large glass jars and hands them to Kyle] Read the labels on these! Go on, read them!"
2151,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[reads the labels] Code 234
2152,10,9,911truth Man,We think they came from a government office.
2153,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,What is it?
2154,10,9,911truth Man,It's anthrax.
2155,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Anthrax?!
2156,10,9,911truth Man,Someday we'll use it as evidence against them.
2157,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, we can't be seen with this nutjob! [at that moment the house is raided by Chicago cops. The doors and windows fall away as they rush inside. An ambulance and a lot of police cars wait outside as a helicopter hovers overhead. Kyle stands with the jars of anthrax, sure that he's in big trouble] Aw, aw, awww!"
2158,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Why, Clyde? Why did you do it?"
2159,10,9,Clyde Donovan,"I don't know. [looks away as Mr. Mackey gets up, walks around the desk, and stands behind him, to his left]"
2160,10,9,Mr Mackey,"You got a whole school here, Clyde! M'kay? You got over three hundred people that need to use the boys' room. [walks behind Clyde to the right side. Clyde looks away and to the left] Then you decide you're gonna be a comedian, m'kay, and pinch one off in the urinal, and leave it layin' there for everyone to have to look at! [Clyde tries hard to contain his laughter] Okay okay, you think it's funny, but nobody else does! They gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll! [Clyde grins, then bursts out laughing. The door opens and Principal Victoria looks in]"
2161,10,9,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Mackey, Clyde's parents are here."
2162,10,9,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, that's good! [Principal Victoria walks away. Mr. Mackey addresses Clyde again] Let's see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade! [The Donovans show up] Come on in, please. I'm just trying to get your son to explain why... he would drop a dook in the urinal!"
2163,10,9,Mr Donovan,"Mr. Mackey, there's something you should know..."
2164,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Eh-xcuse me, there's been a misunderstanding."
2165,10,9,Donald Rumsfeld,"Come on in, Mr. President. [President Bush comes in through one of the side doors]"
2166,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, Mr. President, my name is-"
2167,10,9,President George Bush,SSHHUUDDUUPP!! You think we don't know your name?! We know everything! We control everything! [walks to his desk] We've all worked very hard to keep our involvement in 9/11 a secret! But you just had to keep digging!
2168,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[quite surprised] Really?
2169,10,9,911truth Man,You won't get away with it! People know!
2170,10,9,President George Bush,People? You mean sheeple. We have the majority of them kept in blissful ignorance. Just one more... leak... [pulls out a pistol and his voice gets sinister] to fix... [the Secret Service agents take the 911truth man to the President]
2171,10,9,911truth Man,Wait. What are you doing?
2172,10,9,President George Bush,"[leaves his desk and cocks the gun] You've been a thorn in our side for too long, I'm afraid."
2173,10,9,911truth Man,No! You can't do this! [Bush grabs him by the collar] Please! I'll stop. I'll take down the Web site. I'll sto- [the President sticks the gun into the man's mouth] Oh no! Oh no!
2174,10,9,President George Bush,Too late. [squeezes the trigger once and the bullet goes clear through the man's head. The 911truth man is dead]
2175,10,9,Stan Marsh,JESUS CHRIST!!
2176,10,9,Donald Rumsfeld,[Condoleezza Rice stands to his left] Hahaha. He died like a pig.
2177,10,9,President George Bush,[wipes the blood off his clothes and skin] Some pigs never learn.
2178,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[in sheer disbelief, cocks his head right] No. Way."
2179,10,9,Stan Marsh,He was right. You DID cause 9/11.
2180,10,9,President George Bush,"Yes. Quite simple to pull off, really. All I had to do was have explosives planted in the base of the towers. Then on 9/11 we pretended like four planes were being hijacked.when really we just rerouted them to Pennsylvania, then flew two military jets into the World Trade Center filled with more explosives, then shot down all the witnesses of Flight 93 with an F-15 after blowing up the Pentagon with a Cruise missile. It was only the world's most intricate and flawlessly-executed ever, ever."
2181,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[ever more incredulous, cocks his head left and lower] ...Really??"
2182,10,9,Stan Marsh,Why?!
2183,10,9,President George Bush,"[smiling, he begins to pace] Oldest reason in the world. Money. The towers fell and the American sheeple all waved their flags. [walks by Dick Cheney, who's got a crossbow and is dressed to hunt] Finally we could invade Iraq, [finishes off with sinister glee] and get the oil which made us all richer than before."
2184,10,9,Donald Rumsfeld,"[rubs his hands together greedily] Beauutiful money, hahahaha!"
2185,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[cocks his head right and even lower. He's not buying it] ...Really??
2186,10,9,Stan Marsh,[off on a different page] Is the whole government in on this?
2187,10,9,President George Bush,"We are all-knowing and all-powerful. Good-bye, boys. [steps aside as Dick Cheney takes aim at them. Cheney fires an arrow at them, but the arrow hits a marble vase on a table behind the boys. The arrow bounces off the vase and hits fire alarm, which sets off the sprinkler system. Everyone does his best not to get wet]"
2188,10,9,Dick Cheney,Dangit! I missed again!
2189,10,9,President George Bush,"For Christ's sake, Cheney! [Two aids open the doors to the Oval Office and enter]"
2190,10,9,Stan Marsh,[seeing their chance] Kyle! Run! [the boys take off with the Secret Service in hot pursuit]
2191,10,9,President George Bush,KILL THEM!
2192,10,9,Mr Mackey,"Attention students. Apparently, Clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal, because Clyde had a colostomy at age 5. 'Kay? Now, whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large. The boys' bathroom is closed until further notice, 'cause one of you thought it would be a good idea... to pull down your pants... m'kay, hover your buttcheeks over the urinal... and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog... m'kay? [all the kids in the hall listen, then start laughing] Oh you think that's funny, huh?! [Principal Victoria is also snickering in the background] Let me assure you, there is nothing funny... about going up to a nice, clean, unsuspectin' urinal, [next shot is the school gym, where some students are practicing their basketball skills, but now they're listening] 'kay, droppin' your pants then... turnin' around... squattin' over that urinal, 'kay, maybe... maybe pullin' your buttcheeks apart with your hands, m'kay, and then layin' out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see. [the kids there begin to laugh] Oh yeah, that's real funny! [turns off the mic and slams it down] I'm gonna catch this sonofabitch if it's the last thing I DO! M'kay?! [moves off]"
2193,10,9,Stan Marsh,"All right, now we have to switch over to Interbus 65. We made it dude. [next scene is another city, somewhere] We should be home in less than eighteen hours. Then we'll tell everyone what we saw."
2194,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,It just... doesn't seem right.
2195,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, our eyes are finally open, dude. It's like waking up for the first time."
2196,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah... but doesn't it seem like we got out of the White House pretty easily? I mean, it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the White House with everyone chasing you, and we just kind of... ran out. [a door opens besides them and the 911truth man the President had shot exits a restaurant and goes the other direction]"
2197,10,9,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, maybe we're just super badass. Have you thought of that? [Kyle stops and turns around]"
2198,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey! [the 911truth man turns around, then panics as he recognizes the boys] Dude. You're alive? [the man stands there for a few seconds, not knowing what to do, then turns around and runs away, pushing people aside. Kyle gives chase] Come back here! [the man keeps running]"
2199,10,9,Man 1,Hey!
2200,10,9,Man 2,Ogh!
2201,10,9,911truth Man,[begins to plead] No. Please. Pleeease!
2202,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! What the hell is going on?!
2203,10,9,911truth Man,"Don't kill me! I, I just do what they say!"
2204,10,9,Stan Marsh,What who said?
2205,10,9,911truth Man,I have a family. Please don't kill me!
2206,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we aren't going to kill you. [just then a gunshot is heard and the 911truth man falls dead... again]"
2207,10,9,Stan Marsh,Oh God!
2208,10,9,Bearded Man,"[appears with the smoking gun] It isn't safe here, boys. Follow me!"
2209,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Who the fuck are you?!
2210,10,9,Bearded Man,There's no time! come on! [the camera pans up but stays focused on the three folks as the boys follow the bearded man out of the alley.]
2211,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Do you mind telling us what the hell is going on??
2212,10,9,Stan Marsh,Who are you?
2213,10,9,Bearded Man,"[pours himself a drink] I'm a detective, and I'm afraid that you kids have been double-crossed."
2214,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,You f-figured this thing all out?
2215,10,9,Bearded Man,"Not me. My mystery-solving sons. Come on in, boys. [the Hardly Boys enter] My boys were researching who went number two in the urinal at your school when they discovered something odd, which gave them a clue."
2216,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",Gave us both a clue.
2217,10,9,Mr Hardly,"That clue led them to a 9/11 conspiracy group party, where they got a lot more clues."
2218,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",I was getting a clue like every two minutes.
2219,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",I got such a raging clue that I almost shot clue goo all over Joe.
2220,10,9,Mr Hardly,Those clues pointed out that all the 9/11 conspiracy theories could be disproven scientifically. And that's when Frank got his biggest clue.
2221,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father",It was huuuge.
2222,10,9,Mr Hardly,That all the 9/11 conspiracy Web sites are run by the government. The 9/11 conspiracy... is a government conspiracy.
2223,10,9,Stan Marsh,Aw Jesus...
2224,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why would the government want people to believe they caused 9/11?
2225,10,9,Mr Hardly,"For a government to have power, they must appear to have complete control. What better way to make people fear them than to convince them they are capable of the most elaborate plan on earth?"
2226,10,9,President George Bush,"[off-screen] That's quite enough, Hardly! [the camera shows him entering with his staff] Don't believe what he says, boys; we caused 9/11. [brings forth a manila folder] It's all right here in these secret documents, [hugs the folder tight] but you'll never get them. [turns around as he yawns, dropping the folder to the floor behind him. No one picks it up]"
2227,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,I knew it! You didn't plan 9/11 and you really didn't shoot that guy!
2228,10,9,President George Bush,"[dropping the act] Boys, you don't understand. People need to think we are all-powerful. That we control the world. If they know we weren't in charge of 9/11 then... we appear to control nothing."
2229,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well why don't you just tell people the truth?!
2230,10,9,President George Bush,"We do that too. And most people believe the truth. But one fourth of the population is retarded. If they wanna believe we control everything with intricate plans, why not let them?"
2231,10,9,Mr Hardly,"Just one thing, Mr. President: How the devil did you know we were all here? [a close-up of Kyle. A gun appears next to his left temple. The camera moves clockwise as it refocuses on Stan, who's got the gun aimed at Kyle. Stan must have told the President]"
2232,10,9,Stan Marsh,"How come you couldn't just go home, dude? That's all we had to do!"
2233,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,Stan! What the fuck?!
2234,10,9,Stan Marsh,It was all planned out!
2235,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,You knew this whole time? Why?
2236,10,9,Stan Marsh,Because it was me. I'm the one who took a dump in the urinal.
2237,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,[backs away a bit] What??
2238,10,9,Stan Marsh,The stalls were full and I didn't wanna miss recess! I didn't think it would turn into such a big deal!
2239,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,So you blamed the government?!
2240,10,9,Mr Hardly,"And the government was more than willing to take the blame, so long as it made them look responsible for 9/11!"
2241,10,9,Stan Marsh,"[lowers his pistol] Oh man, now everyone's gonna know. Why did the stupid Hardly Boys have to be so good at solving mysteries?"
2242,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"So wait, wait: Stan took a dump in the urinal and he contacted the conspiracy Web site? But the conspiracy site was run by the government?"
2243,10,9,Stan Marsh,Yuh.
2244,10,9,Kyle Broflovski,"So then, who was responsible for 9/11?"
2245,10,9,Stan Marsh,Whattaya mean? A bunch of pissed-off Muslims.
2246,10,9,"Frank and Joe Hardly, and their father","[giggles] Yeah. What are you, retarded? [The President and his staff laugh heartily]"
2247,10,9,Mr Hardly,"Well, it looks like this mystery is solved. It's time for the culprit to finally pay!"
2248,10,9,Mr Mackey,"When you dook in the urinal, it's bad, m'kay! [Stan squirts some cleaning fluid onto the urinal basin] How would you feel... if somebody came into your home, m'kay, pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your mom's face? [Stan laughs] Oh you think that's funny, huh?! Yeah, that's real funny!"
2249,10,10,Cartman,"And so then, I put my finger up my butthole, right? And I walked up to Kelly Nelson, and I said, ""Do you smell lemon grass?"", and she smelled my finger and puked! Hehehehe. Oh, guys, you should have been there."
2250,10,10,A Hall Monitor,"[a ginger, he taps on Cartman's right shoulder] Eric, I have to take you to the principal's office."
2251,10,10,Cartman,"What? I didn't do it, Kelly Nelson's a liar!"
2252,10,10,A Hall Monitor,I've been instructed to bring you to the principal's office.
2253,10,10,Cartman,"Oh, suck my balls you ginger Jew rat hall monitor! Punkass stoolie, who the fuck do you think you are?!"
2254,10,10,A Hall Monitor,I'm just doin' my job.
2255,10,10,Cartman,[taunting and jabbing at him] I'm juh duh duh duhhh! Do you know why you're a hallway monitor?! Because you don't have any friends! You should kill yourself! You should kill yourself!!
2256,10,10,Principal Victoria,"Eric Cartman, report to the principal's office immediately."
2257,10,10,Cartman,Aw Goddamnit!
2258,10,10,Principal Victoria,"Come on in, Eric. [Cartman and the hall monitor enter]"
2259,10,10,Cartman,"[apologizes, but in a blas fashion] I'm sorry, Principal Victoria. I didn't mean to do it, how could I have been so foolish?"
2260,10,10,Principal Victoria,"Eric, the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor. [the former hall monitor removes his belt and sash and prepares to give them to Cartman]"
2261,10,10,Cartman,The hall monit- me?
2262,10,10,Mr Mackey,"You need to watch for bad behavior, and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass. M'kay? [Cartman receives the sash and the former hall monitor leaves]"
2263,10,10,Principal Victoria,"If anyone doesn't, you have the authority to bring them to me."
2264,10,10,Cartman,[incredulous] Auth- authoritah?
2265,10,10,Mr Mackey,"Now Eric, being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility. M'kay? It is important that you take the job seriously, and that you don't abuse the power."
2266,10,10,Cartman,Ahem. Me?
2267,10,10,Cartman,"There's fear and darkness all around you
The criminals are on the run
No use in not having your hall pass
I'll take you to the principal 'cause I'm the Dawg
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg
The Hallway Monitor!
[laughs until a hand appears and knocks on the driver's window.]"
2268,10,10,Car Salesman,"[opens the door] Hey, kid, get outta there."
2269,10,10,Cartman,That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [leaves. The video shoot resumes at school. Cartman is on the job when he turns around and sees someone else in the hall. He strikes a dramatic pose and yells] Hall pass! Show me your hall pass!
2270,10,10,Boy,What?
2271,10,10,Cartman,"[shoves the boy into the lockers and whips out the Bear Spray] You know what this is? This is the mace that they use on bears, faggot! Now let me see your hall pass!"
2272,10,10,Boy,It's right here. [reaches into his pocket and pulls it out to show him]
2273,10,10,Cartman,"[releases the boy] All right, cool, brah. Go with Christ. [turns right and walks away. The boy isn't quite finished]"
2274,10,10,Boy,What? You can't just push me up against the-
2275,10,10,Cartman,[kicks the boy away] Argh!
2276,10,10,Boy,[flies out of view]Aah!
2277,10,10,Cartman,"[marches on] I am the Dawg, the big bad- [stops] Oh my God! [sees a wad of paper on the floor, runs up to pick it up and checks it out] What the fuck is this?!"
2278,10,10,Teacher,"And so this shape with four sides is what, class?"
2279,10,10,Cartman,"[bursts into the classroom] Boyarrrgh! [everyone turns to see who it is. Cartman walks up to Ike] Ike Broflovski! You littering my hallway, brah?!"
2280,10,10,Teacher,What are you doing?!
2281,10,10,Cartman,"I found this in the hallway. [unfolds the wad of paper - it's a drawing Ike made of his teacher with hearts all around her] Apparently your student Ike has a crush on you. [Ike looks around nervously] You got a crush on your teacher, brah?! Keep it out of my hallway! Go with Christ. Here you go. [hands the drawing to the teacher and heads for the door]"
2282,10,10,Teacher,I don't think that's really necessary.
2283,10,10,Cartman,"Hey! I don't tell you how to run your class, don't tell me how to run my hallway! [leaves and closes the door]"
2284,10,10,Fillmore,Ike has a crush on teacher!
2285,10,10,Class,Ike has a crush on teacher! [the class laughs]
2286,10,10,Teacher,"That's enough, class! [the period ends and the teacher begins erasing the chalkboard] Okay, well see you tomorrow, everybody. Ike, could you stay just a few minutes, please? [Fillmore takes his crayon and leaves. The teacher moves towards Ike] Ike, I'm very flattered, by all of your love notes, but I need to be clear. See, there've been a lot of female teachers on the news lately who have been having relationships with young male students and, people might get the wrong idea, even though... I do admire you. You are so smart and gifted. Soo mature for your age."
2287,10,10,Ike,I don't like Mason.
2288,10,10,Teacher,"You listen, and you really care about what I have to say. You make me feel things I've never... [reaches out to Ike and touches his right hand] felt before. [she and Ike hold hands, but she lets go and leaves her seat]  Ike, this is crazy. I'm your teacher. How can we be having these feelings for each other? [turns around and faces him] You're so mysterious, and I can't... and I can't... [begins to swoon. A montage follows]"
2289,10,10,REO Speedwagon,"And I can't fight this feelin' anymore
I've forgotten what I started fightin' for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashin' through your door
Baby, I cant fight this feelin' anymore
[the last scene is the two of them under the covers ]"
2290,10,10,Teacher,"That was unbelievable. I've never felt like such a woman before. They'll say our love is wrong, but we can't let anybody know; they'll never understand. [rolls to her right and starts massaging Ike tenderly] We were meant to be, I know it. How else could sex be that incredible? [lays back down]"
2291,10,10,Ike,[oops] Ike made a nuno.
2292,10,10,Butters,"Hey there, Mr. Wiener, whattaya know? Do ya need to tinkle tinkle? [falsetto] Yes I do think so."
2293,10,10,Cartman,[bursts into the restroom. Butters is startled] Hands?! Let me see those hands!
2294,10,10,Butters,[backs off] Haaaah!
2295,10,10,Cartman,"[advances] Where's your pass?! Show me your hall pass, brah!"
2296,10,10,Butters,"[looks around frantically for it] It's, it's... I just had it! [keeps looking, but Cartman grabs him...]"
2297,10,10,Cartman,"I knew it! [...slams his head against a toilet stall, then tosses him to the floor, cuffs him, and escorts him out of the restroom. Butters doesn't get a chance to pull his pants up. The hall pass remains on the sink where Butters left it.]"
2298,10,10,Cartman,"Look, brah, I had to bring you in, but I don't have any hard feelin's against you all right?"
2299,10,10,Butters,Huh?
2300,10,10,Cartman,"Here, you need a smoke, brah?"
2301,10,10,Butters,"Uhh, okay. [Cartman puts a cigarette into Butters' mouth, then lights it for him]"
2302,10,10,Cartman,"You've gotta give yourself over to Christ, brah."
2303,10,10,Butters,I do. [coughs]
2304,10,10,Cartman,"Jesus is Lord. You can go one direction in life, or you just walk around the hallways without a hall pass. Or you can see the light, brah. [Butters coughs some more]"
2305,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[greets him holding some laundry] Kyle, I need you to go get your brother over at his teacher's house."
2306,10,10,Kyle,Huh?
2307,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Tell his teacher I'm sorry, but I forgot he has a doctor's appointment today."
2308,10,10,Kyle,What's he doing at his teacher's house?
2309,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,He's been going there in the afternoons for private tutoring.
2310,10,10,Kyle,"Hello? [finds the door open and walks in] Excuse me. I'm here to pick up Ike? [moves further into the house] Uh, hello? Is Ike here? [enters the room the music and some giggling is coming from - it's the bathroom] Hello? [the teacher, in the bathtub, looks at him]"
2311,10,10,Teacher,OOOH! [covers her breasts]
2312,10,10,Kyle,"Oh God! [squeezes his eyes shut] I'm sorry. [opens them again] I didn't mean to-ah, I'm looking for my brother. [Ike pops up out of the water dressed in snorkel gear. Kyle's eyebrows go up] Ike?? [they just look at him] What the hell is going on??"
2313,10,10,Teacher,"Oh, what's the use, Ike? We're caught. [moments later, an angry Kyle is pulling Ike towards the front door] Hold on, please, you don't understand."
2314,10,10,Kyle,[turns to look at her] Really?! What's there not to understand?!
2315,10,10,Teacher,Your brother and I... are in love.
2316,10,10,Kyle,"He's a little young, don't you think?!"
2317,10,10,Ike,"Oh. [angrily, he leaves Kyle for his teacher]"
2318,10,10,Teacher,"Ike is very mature for his age, and you know it!"
2319,10,10,Ike,Ring around the rosey.
2320,10,10,Teacher,"He makes me feel like nobody else does. He loves me and only me, and I know I'm a goddess to him. When we make love, he can give it to me HARD, or soft and gentle-"
2321,10,10,Kyle,All right! We're getting the hell out of here! [begins to pull Ike away from the teacher]
2322,10,10,Ike,"[resisting] Nonono, nononono."
2323,10,10,Kyle,"Ike, you can't possibly want this. We have to tell Mom."
2324,10,10,Ike,"[sobbing] No, no."
2325,10,10,Kyle,Ike?
2326,10,10,Teacher,Is it so hard to believe that true love exists?
2327,10,10,Kyle,[turns to the front door] This is nuts.
2328,10,10,Kyle,"Mom, Dad, have you ever met Ike's kindergarten teacher? [Ike glares at Kyle]"
2329,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,Miss Stevenson? Yes. She's very nice.
2330,10,10,Kyle,"Yeah. Well, she likes Ike a whole lot."
2331,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,That's great.
2332,10,10,Kyle,"Yyeah, except maybe it's not perfectly great, because to some degree, Ike and Ms. Stevenson are having an-."
2333,10,10,Ike,"Spider-Man! I'm safe, Mom."
2334,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Yes, Ike, you like Spider-Man, don't you?"
2335,10,10,Kyle,"Mom, there might be something that you should look into about Ike staying after school all the time-"
2336,10,10,Ike,Weohhh part ten. Mom-my I love you I love you.
2337,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Mommy loves you too, sweetie."
2338,10,10,Kyle,"Would you excuse us for a second? [leaves his chair and takes Ike to the living room. Kyle now addresses Ike] You just can't expect me to sit there and say nothing. No, Ike, I'm supposed to be looking out for you. So what? I wasn't going to just blurt it out, I was gonna use some tact, but you won't even let me... What? Uh uh! Stop right there, Ike! [Ike replies with a series of snippets from nursery rhymes, which has nothing to do with Kyle's concern. Kyle is finished, and the two of them return to the table] Mom, I think maybe you should talk to Ike about love and sex!"
2339,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,"Sex? Oh bubbe, Ike is much too young. [silence follows as the family continues eating]"
2340,10,10,Det Yates,"You're so full of crap, Foley."
2341,10,10,Foley,What? I did shoot him in the face. Twice.
2342,10,10,Kyle,"[appears at the breakroom entrance] Ex, excuse me? [the officers look, and he walks in] My name is... Brad. And uh I need to report a crime. Anonymously."
2343,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,Oh? What's the crime?
2344,10,10,Kyle,"Well, I attend South Park Elementary, ah-and... w-one of the teachers is having sssex with a student."
2345,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,"Oh my God! This is terrible! [other officers say other things. Yates and another officer get on bended knee next to Kyle] Ya-you did the right thing telling the police, Brad. Now, who is the teacher? What's his name?"
2346,10,10,Kyle,"Well, it isn't a guy teacher. It's a woman."
2347,10,10,Officer 1,A woman.
2348,10,10,Kyle,Yeah. She's having sex with a boy. [the officer to his right is taking notes.]
2349,10,10,Officer 2,"Oh, but, but she's ugly, right?"
2350,10,10,Kyle,"Well no, not really. It's the Kindergarten teacher, Miss Stevenson."
2351,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,The blonde?
2352,10,10,Kyle,Yeah.
2353,10,10,Officer 1,Some young boy is having sex with Miss Stevenson?
2354,10,10,Kyle,[firmly] Yes.
2355,10,10,Officer 1,Nisssse.
2356,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,Nnice.
2357,10,10,Kyle,"What?! No, you don't understand-"
2358,10,10,Officer 1,You sure they've had sex?
2359,10,10,Kyle,Yeah.
2360,10,10,Officer 3,Has she performed oral sex on him?
2361,10,10,Kyle,I think so.
2362,10,10,Officer 3,...Nice.
2363,10,10,Officer 1,Nisssse.
2364,10,10,Officer 3,[whispers] Nisssse.
2365,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,"So wait, what, what's the crime?"
2366,10,10,Officer 1,"The crime is, she isn't doing it with me. [jabs jokingly at Officer 2. All the officers laugh]"
2367,10,10,Kyle,Hay! He's totally underage. She's taking advantage of him.
2368,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,"You're right. We're sorry. This is serious. We need to track this student down and... give him his ""Luckiest Boy In America"" medal right away. [All the officers laugh harder]"
2369,10,10,Kyles,[throws his hands up in frustration and leaves] Gargh!
2370,10,10,Kyle,"Guys, can I talk to you?"
2371,10,10,Stan,Sure dude.
2372,10,10,Kyle,"I need you to keep quiet about this, all right? [Cartman walks up] My little brother and his tea-"
2373,10,10,Cartman,"Brahs, it's almost class time. I need you to start clearin' the hallways aright?"
2374,10,10,Kyle,"Not now, Cartman! I have really serious problems!"
2375,10,10,Stan,"Dude, what's the matter?"
2376,10,10,Kyle,The kindergarten teacher is having sex with my little brother.
2377,10,10,Stan,...Wow.
2378,10,10,Kenny,(Reaaly??)
2379,10,10,Cartman,"Damn, brah, your little brother's pretty cool."
2380,10,10,Kyle,It's not cool! Ike isn't old enough to understand.
2381,10,10,Cartman,"What's to understand? You get a boner, slap her titties around some and then stick it inside her and pee."
2382,10,10,Kyle,"[looks long and hard at Cartman] ""stick it inside her and pee"""
2383,10,10,Cartman,"Well, okay, fine. Unless you don't want to get her pregnant, then you pull it out and pee on her leg."
2384,10,10,Stan,"Dude, I really don't see a problem."
2385,10,10,Cartman,"Yeah, I've got bigger things to deal with."
2386,10,10,Kyle,"You guys don't understand! His wacko teacher is like a schoolgirl! They pass notes to each other in the classroom, they have sex at her house over lunch break, [Cartman waves Kyle off and walks away] and during class they sneak out and kiss in the hallways! [this stops Cartman and makes his eyes big]"
2387,10,10,Cartman,They what??
2388,10,10,Kyle,They sneak out during class and make out in the hallways!
2389,10,10,Cartman,[spins around] Hang on a second: making out in the hallways is strictly against school policy!
2390,10,10,Kyle,Well they're doing it!
2391,10,10,Cartman,"Yeah, well now it's personal! The hallways are my jurisdiction! If there's a hallway infraction going on, they're gonna have to deal with the Dawg!"
2392,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"Okay, just continue with your macaroni pictures. Teacher has to step out for a second. Uh Ike, could you help me out, please? [Ike leaves his seat and joins Miss Stevenson outside. She puts him on the shelf of the telephone booth next to the classroom] Oh Ike, I just had to have a second alone with you."
2393,10,10,Ike,I like dada better.
2394,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"I got your love letter, and I wrote you one back. Oh, just one kiss to hold me over for the rest of class. [she begins to kiss Ike. Cartman appears in the distance and turns right...]"
2395,10,10,Cartman,Hall infraction! [runs up to Miss Stevenson]
2396,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"[turning to Cartman] Oh uhh, we were just heading back in."
2397,10,10,Cartman,"You got a hall pass, brah?!"
2398,10,10,Miss Stevenson,I don't need a hall pass. I'm a teacher.
2399,10,10,Cartman,"Yeah? Well, where's his hall pass?!"
2400,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"Look, just let us get back in-"
2401,10,10,Cartman,Get down on the floor!
2402,10,10,Miss Stevenson,We're going back inside!
2403,10,10,Cartman,"[whips out the Bear Spray] You like bear mace, icehead?!"
2404,10,10,Miss Stevenson,Bear mace??
2405,10,10,Cartman,You're goin' with Christ! [sprays Miss Stevenson pretty good]
2406,10,10,Miss Stevenson,Oooooh!
2407,10,10,Cartman,"...And that's what I got, Principal brah. These two were in the hallway making out. She had those love letters on her person."
2408,10,10,Principal Victoria,"""Ike, I long to feel your arms around me""?? Miss Stevenson, you- you're having a relationship with this student?"
2409,10,10,Cartman,"Yes. During classtime, without a hall pass."
2410,10,10,Principal Victoria,This is unbelievable.
2411,10,10,Cartman,I know. It's like a hall pass doesn't even matter to her.
2412,10,10,Principal Victoria,"Miss Stevenson, I will need to inform the police."
2413,10,10,Miss Stevenson,[puts her hands to her cheeks] Oh God...
2414,10,10,Cartman,"You just dealt with the Dawg, bitch!"
2415,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,"[sarcastically] Sorry we had to do this, but the lady principal insisted. [the officers move past Yates]"
2416,10,10,Randy Marsh,[shows up next to Jimbo and Ned] What's goin' on?
2417,10,10,Jimbo Kern,The kindergarten teacher is suspected of having sex with a student
2418,10,10,Randy Marsh,With a student? But... she's a woman.
2419,10,10,Jimbo Kern,Yeah. I know.
2420,10,10,Randy Marsh,But... she's hot.
2421,10,10,Kyle,"Wow. I think I owe you one, Cartman."
2422,10,10,Cartman,You don't owe me anything. My hallways are cleeean. [points his index fingers at the camera]
2423,10,10,Kyle,"[sensing Ike, turns around in his chair] Ike, I didn't tell on you, you got busted by the hallway monitor. [Ike glares at him] Okay, okay. I did have something to do with it. But someday you're gonna realize it was for the best."
2424,10,10,Ike,You are dead to me!
2425,10,10,Kyle,What?
2426,10,10,Ike,"I said, you're dead to me!"
2427,10,10,Kyle,I'm dead to you?
2428,10,10,Ike,"[points at him] You're dead to me, Kyle!"
2429,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"I'm at the police station. They say they found some evidence. I'm so scared. [Ike is at the other end of the line] Listen, I want you to know it's okay. If anybody tries to talk to you, you don't need to say anything. Just leave it to me. I know a way out of this."
2430,10,10,Reporter,"Tom, an elementary school teacher is under arrest for allegedly having an affair... with one of her young students. The case is shocking, due mostly to the fact that the teacher... is pretty hot, Tom. If the accusations are true, then... damn! Uh, looks like the defendant and her lawyer are about to give a statement, Tom."
2431,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"I am deeply sorry to announce that the allegations against me are true. Over the past several weeks, I have been having physical relations with one of my students."
2432,10,10,Man 1,Nice.
2433,10,10,Man 2,[whispers and squeezes his eyes shut] Nissse
2434,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"I know my actions were wrong, but I cannot be fully to blame. You see, I am an alcoholic."
2435,10,10,Officer 4,Ohhhh.
2436,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"Yes, I'm afraid it's true."
2437,10,10,Cartman,Oh no!
2438,10,10,Kyle,What?
2439,10,10,Cartman,I don't believe it. She's using the Mel Gibson defense.
2440,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"I am a perfectly good person, but when I drink, the alcohol makes me say and do things I wouldn't normally do."
2441,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,"Well, that explains it."
2442,10,10,Officer 1,Do we still press charges?
2443,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,Who are we gonna convict? Johnny Walker?
2444,10,10,Man 3,Poor woman. She's a victim.
2445,10,10,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, she's a hot victim. [looks around for any reaction, but none comes]"
2446,10,10,Lawyer,[steps up to the mic] My client has agreed to check herself into rehab immediately. [everyone cheers her on]
2447,10,10,Print Reporter,"Good luck, ma'am. You can beat your alcoholism. [more cheering]"
2448,10,10,Rehab Therapist,"Alcohol is a crutch which we use to medicate ourselves; to, to cover up emotional baggage from our past. Was there ever a history of sexual abuse in your family?"
2449,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"No, but my uncle used to ask me and my twin sister to kiss and he'd take pictures."
2450,10,10,Rehab Therapist,"Nissse. [sometime later, they're outside the center. He sees her off] Congratulations, Miss Stevenson."
2451,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"All better now. [walks away, gets into her truck and drives away. She drives up to the Broflovski house, stops, gets out a ladder and extends it, props it up against Ike's window, and climbs up]"
2452,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"Ike. [climbs in and walks to Ike. He turns and stands, his arms outstretched]"
2453,10,10,Ike,"Miss Stephenson [she kneels down, picks him up and holds him close]"
2454,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"Ike, we have to get out of here! They'll never let us be together. I think... I think we should go to Milan, like we always talked about. [puts both her hands to her heart]"
2455,10,10,Ike,"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay, Mulan!"
2456,10,10,Miss Stevenson,Get your things together. We don't have much time.
2457,10,10,Kyle,"Ike, are you okay? [sees an emptier room than usual, and the open window.] Ike? [walks up to the window and sees the ladder still in place.] Iiiike! [the teacher and Ike away.]"
2458,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,"Are you sure you're not lying, Foley?"
2459,10,10,Foley,"No, really! I shot both of them! They weren't even doin' nothin'!"
2460,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,"[enters the breakroom with Kyle following close behind] Help! Please, I need your help! That teacher, Miss Stevenson, she, she left town with my son! I got a note saying they're going to Milan!"
2461,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,You're kidding!
2462,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,"No, it's true!"
2463,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,"Damnit, where were all these sexed-up teachers when I was a kid?!"
2464,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,This is serious!
2465,10,10,Officer 3,"Yeah, boys going to Milan with a beautiful older woman. Quick! Call the FBI! [the officers laugh. Detective Yates smiles]"
2466,10,10,Sheila Broflovski,Are you going to do nothing?!
2467,10,10,Det. Yates and fellow officers,"[irritated] All right all right, we'll make a report. Jesus..."
2468,10,10,Cartman,"There you are. What are you doing? You giving up, brah?!"
2469,10,10,Kyle,"Dude, my brother's in Milan. There's nothing I can do."
2470,10,10,Cartman,"No, they haven't left yet. Their flight is tomorrow morning."
2471,10,10,Kyle,How do you know that?
2472,10,10,Cartman,I had Beth check out their Travelocity account.
2473,10,10,Kyle,Who's Beth?
2474,10,10,Cartman,"Beth is my bitch. I put a whole crew together, brah. I'm gonna get that hallway-defilng slut no matter what it takes! Are you in?!"
2475,10,10,Cartman,"I got some badass guys to help me.
I only had to pay them fifteen bucks.
You think you got away with not having a hall pass?
You won't get away from me 'cause I'm the Dawg!
I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!

Think you can get away with not having a hall pass? Think again! [the video ends and the hallway looks normal again] How was that, Butters?"
2476,10,10,Butters,[behind the camera] Ehthat was pretty good.
2477,10,10,Kyle,"Can we get going now, please?!"
2478,10,10,Cartman,"Yep. We're all done with the video, let's move out! [they go forth]"
2479,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"Ike, is that all you're gonna do is watch TV?"
2480,10,10,Ike,I love TV. Yaaay!
2481,10,10,Miss Stevenson,[climbs into bed] But what about me? I want to talk. [Ike just goes back to watching the TV]
2482,10,10,Cartman,Everyone get a good look at our fugitive! I want her taken down fast and clean!
2483,10,10,Leeroy and Earl,"[in a retarded voice] She ran away; now she got to deal with the Dawg, huh?"
2484,10,10,Cartman,"[determined] Beth found out they have a room at the Airport Hilton. We need to search it. Here's the hotel! [into the Intercom] Beth, tell Leeroy to pull up here! [Beth just signals for Earl to drive into the hotel driveway and stop at the front doors. Earl pulls up and brakes quickly] All right, let's go! Move out! [they leave the SUV and rush into the hotel]"
2485,10,10,Bellboy,Hey! You can't leave your car there!
2486,10,10,Cartman,"It's okay! I'm a hallway monitor! [they pass through the front entrance] Keep separation! Leeroy, check out our twenty!"
2487,10,10,"Bellboy, Concierge, Receptionist",Can I help you?
2488,10,10,Cartman,"You seen this woman, brah? [shows her a picture of Miss Stevenson] She's staying here!"
2489,10,10,"Bellboy, Concierge, Receptionist",Who are you?
2490,10,10,Cartman,"I am the Dawg, the big bad Dawg!"
2491,10,10,Head Concierge,I think you should leave before I call the police!
2492,10,10,Cartman,"Beth! Bear-mace that guy! [she sprays bear mace all over the concierge and he crumbles to the floor, trying to vomit] Let's check out the rooms! Leeroy and Kyle go that way! Beth, you come with me!"
2493,10,10,Bellboy,"[dials 911] We need police here, right away! [Cartman begins his rounds. He goes to Room 236 and knocks on the door with the bear mace can]"
2494,10,10,Guest 1,"[a man, opens the door] Yes?"
2495,10,10,Cartman,"I'm looking for this teacher! Is she in your room, brah?!"
2496,10,10,Guest 2,[an elderly man in Room 233] Do you mind keepin' it down?
2497,10,10,Cartman,"[walks over to the second guest] Keep your mouth shut, brah!!"
2498,10,10,Miss Stevenson,Oh no! Ike! [Ike climbs up to see the commotion] They're on to us!
2499,10,10,Ike,Oh no!
2500,10,10,Miss Stevenson,Hurry darling! We have to get out of here!
2501,10,10,Officers,What have we got? What have we got?!
2502,10,10,Officer 5,Who called 911?!
2503,10,10,"Bellboy, Concierge, Receptionist",They went that way. [points in the direction Kyle and Leeroy took. The concierge barfs continuously. The officers leave] Look out! They have bear mace!
2504,10,10,Leeroy and Earl,[pounds at the door at Room 323] Open up! I'm with the Dawg! [pounds some more]
2505,10,10,Kyle,Oh crap! [some officers round the corner at the far end of the hall]
2506,10,10,Officer 6,[draws his gun] You freeze right there! [Kyle and Leeroy run in the other direction]
2507,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"Come on, darling! [Ike steps out and they beginning walking. Earl rounds the corner behind them and catches them]"
2508,10,10,Leeroy and Earl,"Hey! [they stop and the camera zooms in on Earl.] Uh I got 'em, Dawg. Fifth floor!"
2509,10,10,Cartman,Praise Christ! Let's go! [the elderly man is convulsing from the effects of the bear mace.]
2510,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"Ike, run! [back on the second floor, Cartman and Beth run down a hallway]"
2511,10,10,Cartman,Bear mace that guy! And that guy! [Beth maces another bellboy and a guest as she and Cartman run by. Police officers round the corner and run after them]
2512,10,10,Cartman,"Freeze, bitch!"
2513,10,10,Officer 7,Freeze!
2514,10,10,Officer 8,Hands up! Hands up!
2515,10,10,Officer 9,Don't move! Don't move!
2516,10,10,Cartman,It's all right! There's been a misunderstanding! I'm a hall monitor. [the officers are somewhat stunned] This fugitive is trying to avoid a hallway infraction by skipping off to Milan.
2517,10,10,Officer 1,"Hey, that is the teacher we just got the report about. [she and Ike back up slowly, towards the roof's edge. Kyle and Leeroy show up]"
2518,10,10,Officer 7,"[through his bullhorn] All right, Miss Stevenson, you got nowhere to go!"
2519,10,10,Miss Stevenson,Why couldn't you just leave us alone? All we wanted was to love.
2520,10,10,Cartman,"Get down! We can do this the easy way, or we can do it Dawg-style!"
2521,10,10,Leeroy and Earl,"She gawt a scarf awn her heyed, huh?"
2522,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"It's all over, Ike. Milan, the house in Tuscany. They'll never let us be together! We have to go with the backup plan. [she and Ike walk to the roof's edge and look down at the ground]"
2523,10,10,Officer 7,"[through his bullhorn] Now hold on, don't do anything foolish! We can talk about this!"
2524,10,10,Miss Stevenson,[returns from the edge with Ike] You can't accept our love? So then we can only be together in eternity.
2525,10,10,Kyle,"[steps through Cartman and Beth towards Ike] No! Ike, don't do it!"
2526,10,10,Ike,I don deser futty bad man.
2527,10,10,Kyle,"Ike, please. I know your first love seems like the only love, but trust me, it's not. You have so much life ahead of you. [Ike looks at Kyle intently]"
2528,10,10,Miss Stevenson,You who don't believe in true love don't understand.
2529,10,10,Kyle,"Ike, you need to have a life. Have fun. Then ruin it by having a serious relationship. [Ike thinks it over]"
2530,10,10,Miss Stevenson,"I'm afraid you're too late. [to Ike] Are you ready, my love? [she and Ike turn around and run for the edge] Here we go! One, two, three, aaaahhh! [she jumps over the edge, Ike turns back and walks towards Kyle. She looks up at the roof's edge] Ike?? [she lands on her back and dies on impact]"
2531,10,10,Ike,Yaaaay!
2532,10,10,Kyle,Ike!
2533,10,10,Cartman,"[moves towards the camera] Well, looks like once again, the Dawg has prevailed. I hope you've learned, kids, that if you don't go with Christ, you could end up just like that splattered bitch down on the pavement."
2534,10,10,Officer 8,"Hey kid, you need to get off the roof now."
2535,10,10,Cartman,That's cool. I'm done making my video anyways. [walks towards the camera to turn it off.]
2536,10,11,Satan,[slow and deliberate] Halloween is a night for evil. It is time for me to take what is mine.
2537,10,11,Demon 1,"[the pale one] What do you plan, Lord Satan?"
2538,10,11,Satan,"On Halloween we shall open the Gates of Hell, rise up to the earth, and we will rent out the entire W Hotel, for an awesome party, and invite a bunch of celebrities!"
2539,10,11,Demon 2,[second from right] How big a party are we talking?
2540,10,11,Satan,"Have you seen those rich, spoiled, teenage girls who have massive Sweet 16 parties? That big."
2541,10,11,Demon 2,"Satan, we can't possibly do-"
2542,10,11,Satan,"SILENCE! [descends from his thrown to the floor] Halloween is about me! And I deserve a par-ty! This... shall be MY Super Sweet 16!! [raises his arms up in victory and laughs heartily. A few blasts of steam pop out of volcanoes and the citizens of Hell are frightened. Satan's image appears in the smoke] Minions of Hell! The time has come for us to rise! For my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party!! [the minions look at each other] I got Bacardi, and Ghetto One to sponsor the party, and I'm calling it [a poster for the event appears] Hell On Earth 2006! [everyone yells approval] But now, heed my words: in order to get in to the party, you have to RSVP and get a blue wristband. Everyone is gonna try and get into this party, so if you don't get your wristband in advance, or you're not wearing that wristband at the door, you're NOT GETTING IN!! [the volcanoes fire off another batch of smoke and the minions tremble] And NOW know this: It's a costume party, so you have to wear a costume. BUT... nobody better show up as The Crow! I'm serious. Every costume party there's like fourteen guys come dressed like the Crow 'cause they wanna look hot and hook up. It's lame! If you come dressed as the Crow, you're NOT GETTING IN to the party!! [the volcanoes fire off another batch of smoke and the minions tremble] Go now and prepare!! If you miss my party you are a looozer!! [laughs miniacally and vanishes. The minions tremble once more]"
2543,10,11,George Burns,"Oh boy, a Halloween party up on Earth."
2544,10,11,Ghandi,I can't believe he got the entire W Hotel.
2545,10,11,Princess Diana,This is going to be the best Halloween ever. [Other minions raise their arms and cheer]
2546,10,11,Stan,"Go ahead, Kyle, do it."
2547,10,11,Kyle,[glances defiantly at Stan] I am doing it.
2548,10,11,Tweek,No! Don't do it!
2549,10,11,Cartman,"What's the big deal, Kyle? You just look in the mirror, and say the name three times."
2550,10,11,Kyle,[blinking rather quickly] Biggie. Smalls... Biggie Smalls...
2551,10,11,Cartman,"See? You're scared. Because you know if you say it a third time, he's gonna show up and shoot you in the face. [starts imitating a hen's  cluck]"
2552,10,11,Kyle,"Fine! [hops off the stool and walks past Cartman] Then YOU do it, you're so tough!"
2553,10,11,Cartman,I've done it lots of times.
2554,10,11,Kyle,[pushes Cartman to the stool] Prove it!
2555,10,11,Cartman,"[now on the stool facing the mirror, laughs a bit] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... This is dumb, you guys, let's do somethin' else."
2556,10,11,Kyle,"You're afraid to do it, too."
2557,10,11,Cartman,I am not!
2558,10,11,Butters,"Then do it, if you're not yellow! [Cartman is shocked that Butters talked to him this way, so he raises a fist as if he's about to punch him in the face. Butters flinches.]"
2559,10,11,Cartman,[turns back to the mirror] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [the door opens and Jimmy enters]
2560,10,11,Jimmy,Hey fellas. [Cartman freaks out and falls from the stool.] You should come downstairs. Stan's mom made pa-pizza.
2561,10,11,The other boys,"[rushing out of the bathroom] Let's go. Yeah, let's go!"
2562,10,11,Cartman,"Oh my God. I crapped my pants. [feels his ass through his pants to be sure] You guys, I crapped my pants! [thinks, then leaves the bathroom] Heheh. You guys! You guys, check it out!"
2563,10,11,Demon 1,"Satan, I must speak with thee."
2564,10,11,Satan,[turns around] What is it?
2565,10,11,Demon 1,You've invited so many celebrities on Earth to your party that people in Hell can't get wristbands.
2566,10,11,Satan,Well I have to invite celebrities or else my party won't be cool.
2567,10,11,Demon 1,"Satan, I warn thee, do not throw this party at the cost of alienating your friends."
2568,10,11,Satan,[childishly] I'm not alienating my friends! I know they come first!
2569,10,11,Demon 1,"I hope for your sake that's true. You've never thrown a party of this magnitude before, Satan. Be wary. [turns and leaves]"
2570,10,11,Cardinal Mahoney and the Catholic clergy,"Halloween has always been a time of evil and darkness. But now it appears that Satan will literally be among us. He is bringing Hell here to Los Angeles, and from what we understand, the gathering is going to be... completely off the hook. [the clergymen begin to murmur amongst themselves] There's more: None of us... are invited. [the murmurs get louder]"
2571,10,11,Bishop 1,None?
2572,10,11,Bishop 2,Satan mocks us.
2573,10,11,Bishop 3,His party must be stopped.
2574,10,11,Priest 1,"Yes, we cannot let evil take over our city, even for a night. [he's holding a leash... which has a small naked boy at the other end of it.]"
2575,10,11,Priest 2,[an old priest with his own boy] What can we do? [more boys on leashes begin to appear]
2576,10,11,Resident Bishop,"Tomorrow night, after all of Satan's guests have arrived, we'll call in a complaint about how many people are there. We'll see how long Satan's party lasts... after the fire marshal shows up."
2577,10,11,Butters,"That's why I like to brush my teeth; I know they're clean and white. All the [begins to choke on the words and spits out some toothpaste] I truly love to brush my teeth. [smiles, then frowns. He looks around, then] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [hesitates a bit] Biggie Smalls...  [a second later, Biggie materializes behind Butters]"
2578,10,11,Biggie Smalls,What the fuck is THIS?!
2579,10,11,Butters,AAAAH! [dodges the bullets Biggie begins firing at him.]
2580,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"Hey! [Butters falls off the stool and gets up, runs to the bathroom door and gets out without getting any bullets in him, and makes his way to the front door.]"
2581,10,11,Butters,"[runs outside] WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! [his parents pull into the driveway just as Butters leaves the front steps, and get out of the car]"
2582,10,11,Stephen and Linda Stotch,Butters! We told you to be in bed! What are you doing?!
2583,10,11,Butters,"I summoned Biggie Smalls, the hip-hop rapper!"
2584,10,11,Stephen and Linda Stotch,You had a nightmare! Turn around and get back in your room right now!
2585,10,11,Butters,"But Dad, he's gonna bust a cap in my ass!"
2586,10,11,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Well, you wanna get shot or you wanna be grounded?!"
2587,10,11,Butters,AAAAAAAAAAH! [runs back up to his room]
2588,10,11,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"[to his wife Linda] ...Honestly, why do let him watch that darn Black Entertainment Channel?"
2589,10,11,Satan,"So I want the DJ to set up over here, and then the main dance floor area can be this whole area right here."
2590,10,11,Male Staffer,"What about valets? Ha, how will people be arriving from Hell?"
2591,10,11,Satan,"Oh, it's like a dimensional vortex gate thingy, they won't have cars."
2592,10,11,Female Staffer,Buut we're probably gonna want security at the dimensional vortex gate.
2593,10,11,Satan,I want all the servers dressed in skimpy outfits serving all the hors d'oeuvres.
2594,10,11,Demon 1,This is getting really expensive.
2595,10,11,Satan,"Shut up, it's Halloween! This is my night! Then at midnight, for dessert, I'm thinking over here, we bring out a huuuge chocolate fondue fountain."
2596,10,11,Male Staffer,"Oh yeah, P Diddy had his birthday party here a couple years back and he had one of those."
2597,10,11,Satan,"Oh, screw that, then. I don't want a fondue fountain if P Diddy had one."
2598,10,11,Demon 1,[between his teeth] Does it matter?!
2599,10,11,Satan,Yes it matters! I don't wanna do it if Diddy did it!
2600,10,11,Demon 1,How about a doughnut machine?
2601,10,11,Satan,Did Diddy do it?
2602,10,11,Male Staffer,Diddy did do it.
2603,10,11,Satan,A full ice cream bar!
2604,10,11,Male Staffer,Diddy did it.
2605,10,11,Satan,"[steps forward in frustration] Damnit, what didn't Diddy do?! [thinks a moment] Wait. I know. [turns right] Yes. It's perfect. At midnight, all the lights go down. The music stops. And then we wheel in... a Ferrari. Only it isn't a Ferrari... It's a cake. And everyone gets a piece."
2606,10,11,Demon 1,A Ferrari cake?
2607,10,11,Male Staffer,Diddy didn't do it.
2608,10,11,Demon 1,"Satan, really, the logistics of getting a cake the size of a Ferrari made in time-"
2609,10,11,Satan,"[spins around] This party has to be the bomb! Don't you get it?! [turns around] When everyone sees the Ferrari cake, [makes a fist and says in a low voice] they will shudder and know my greatness!"
2610,10,11,Demon 3,"Hear me, demons! Lord Satan has demanded a Ferrari cake! Now I will take charge of Halloween, and call upon the spirits of Hell's most evil souls! Ted Bundy! [walks into view] Jeffrey Dahmer! [walks into view] And John Wayne Gacy! [walks into view. Each entrance is accompanied by newspaper clippings and actual background shots of their faces] You shall rise once again to walk the earth, for tomorrow is Halloween, and I need you... to pick up Satan's Ferrari cake, and deliver it to the W Hotel!"
2611,10,11,Ted Bundy,No problem.
2612,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,We can handle it.
2613,10,11,Demon 3,"Heed my words: Satan's entire Halloween depends on this Ferrari cake. Fail, and you will know his greatest wrath!"
2614,10,11,Biggie Smalls,You punkass fool!
2615,10,11,Butters,Haaaah.
2616,10,11,Biggie Smalls,Why'd you summon me?
2617,10,11,Butters,"P-please don't ice me, homie?"
2618,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"You'd better have a good reason, sucka!"
2619,10,11,Butters,I just... w-was seein' if it works.
2620,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"[lowers the pistol and walks away] Damn! Every Halloween I gots tuh deal with this shit! I'm in hell, mindin' my own business, and the next thing I know, I'm in some kid's bafroom."
2621,10,11,Butters,"[scared] I Iii, I apologize, Mr. Smalls."
2622,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"[returns and places the tip of the gun against Butters' forehead] You don't understand, fool! I ain't missin' the party!"
2623,10,11,Butters,W-what party?
2624,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"I already got my wristband, see? [lowers the gun and shows off the blue wristband Satan was passing out] You've got to get me to Los Angeles!"
2625,10,11,Butters,Uh whah well can't you just take a plane?
2626,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"How, punk?! We don't use money in here, nigga!"
2627,10,11,Butters,"Well damn, nigger, there's gotta be some way!"
2628,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"[places the tip of the gun against Butters' forehead again] This is your fault, homie! You've gots to get me to that party in L.A., or i'm gonna smoke your ass!"
2629,10,11,Butters,Oh hamburgers!
2630,10,11,Demon 1,"Yes. Yes, Satan. Your Halloween costume turned out perfect."
2631,10,11,Satan,"[dressed as the Crow] Yeah, it's okay, but everyone thinks Zazul's schoolgirl costume is hotter."
2632,10,11,Zazul,[Deomn 3] Ehhhhhhh.
2633,10,11,Satan,"Zazul, switch costumes with me."
2634,10,11,Demon 1,"Satan, Zazul worked really hard on his costume."
2635,10,11,Satan,"Nobody can look hotter than me! It's my Super Sweet 16 Halloween party! Take it off, Zazul. [dejected, Zazul walks away slowly] And what about my Ferrari cake?! Where's the Ferrari cake?!"
2636,10,11,Demon 1,"Relax, it's being picked up from the bakery."
2637,10,11,Ted Bundy,"[looking at a map] All right, this is the place. Now remember, you numbskulls, this Ferrari cake is really important for Satan's party, so don't louse it up!"
2638,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,[as Larry] Who's lousing?
2639,10,11,Ted Bundy,"[as Moe] Come 'ere. [Dahmer draws near, Bundy slaps him] Shut up! [Bundy opens the doors and the three killers go inside]"
2640,10,11,Head Baker,Can I help you?
2641,10,11,Ted Bundy,We're here to pick up the Ferrari cake.
2642,10,11,Head Baker,"Ohhh yes, it's just about finished. What kind of truck are we loading it up to?"
2643,10,11,Ted Bundy,We got that flatbed. [Gacy whips out a butcher knife]
2644,10,11,Head Baker,"Okay well, we're just gonna need to- GYAAAH! [Gacy has just impaled him and begins to slice his body in two by moving the knife towards his head]"
2645,10,11,Ted Bundy,"Gacy, you numbskull, what'd ya kill him for?!"
2646,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,[as Curly] I didn't mean tuh. [a second baker comes out of the kitchen]
2647,10,11,Ted Bundy,Give me that! [takes the knife from him and smacks him upside the head]
2648,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,Oh!
2649,10,11,Ted Bundy,What's the matter with you?! [hands the knife to Dahmer] Take this!
2650,10,11,Baker 2,Everything all right? [Dahmer stabs him in the throat with the knife.] Bwa! Gaaaghaghaghagh!
2651,10,11,Ted Bundy,You nincompoop! [bops him on the head]
2652,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,Ow.
2653,10,11,Ted Bundy,That was the baker!
2654,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,He startled me.
2655,10,11,Ted Bundy,"[looks to his left] Gacy! [goes into the kitchen, where Gady is stabbing away at a third baker] What'dja kill him for?! [bops him on the head] Siddonw!"
2656,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,I'm a victim of circumstance. [Dahmer bops him on the head]
2657,10,11,Ted Bundy,"[grabs Dahmer by the back of the head] Ahh, who're you hittin'? [picks him in the eyes.]"
2658,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,Ohhhh... [stumbles away]
2659,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk. [Bundy smacks him] Oh!
2660,10,11,Ted Bundy,[to Dahmer] Get outta here. [to Gacy] Be quiet. [Gacy makes like he's rubbing blood from his face as he groans] You idiots! Now who's gonna help us load the Ferrari cake onto the flatbed?!
2661,10,11,Officer,"Did your son say anything before he disappeared, Mrs. Stotch?"
2662,10,11,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"He just said something about... summoning Biggie Smalls... [upon hearing this, the other boys know what happened and look at each other.]"
2663,10,11,Cartman,Dude...
2664,10,11,Jimmy,Du... du... dude.
2665,10,11,Stan,[rushes into the living room with the other boys] Dad! Dad!
2666,10,11,Randy Marsh,[reading his newspaper on the sofa] What?
2667,10,11,Stan,"If you look in the mirror and say Biggie Smalls' name three times, he doesn't come and get you, right??"
2668,10,11,Randy Marsh,[thinks a moment] Biggie Smalls?
2669,10,11,Cartman,"You know, escargot, my cargo, one eighteen, sippin' on booze at the House of Blues"
2670,10,11,Randy Marsh,"[folds his paper up and rises] All right, boys, I know it's Halloween, but you can't summon dead rappers in the mirror."
2671,10,11,Cartman,How do you know??
2672,10,11,Randy Marsh,I'm a geologist! [leaves]
2673,10,11,Kyle,He's right. It's just a spooky story.
2674,10,11,Tweek,Hguh. Then how come you couldn't do it?
2675,10,11,Kyle,"I can do it. It just got... look, it just doesn't matter, because it's not true."
2676,10,11,Cartman,How can we be sure? How do we know Butters isn't with Biggie right now? Being tormented by him?
2677,10,11,Butters,"I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh, yeah, I'm going going, back back, to Cali Cali. Uhh-"
2678,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"Yo dawg, keep it down."
2679,10,11,Butters,"Yo dawg, uh, can't I just go back home right after the flight so I don't get grounded?"
2680,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"Oh no! YOU summoned my spirit, YOU're gettin' me all the way to the party! As long as I get to the party in time to party, everything'll be all right. [begins to vanish] Hey! [Smalls is gone]"
2681,10,11,Kyle,...Smalls. [Smalls materializes]
2682,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"Oh, God-damnit! [the boys scream and run out of the bathroom, leaving Kyle on the stool]"
2683,10,11,Stan,It does work!!
2684,10,11,Kyle,Holy crap!!
2685,10,11,Biggie Smalls,[pulls out his gun...] That's it! Now I'm pissed! [...and begins firing away. Kyle and Token are the last to leave.]
2686,10,11,George Burns,"Hehey, everybody. Check out Hitler. [Hitler appears with a cell phone attached to his ear] He's the ""Can you hear me now?"" guy. [the minions around him laugh]"
2687,10,11,Adolf Hitler,[moves from spot to spot and asks] Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? [the minions around him laugh again]
2688,10,11,Satan,"[introducing himself] Everyone quiet! Here he is, the man of the night, SATAN! [four Chippendale men enter, two with leather pants and two with leather briefs, carrying Satan on a litter. Satan is seated on his throne dressed as a girl celebrating her Sweet 16 party. Adolf Hitler wanders by still testing out that cell phone] Get out of the way, Hitler! You're ruining my entrance! Gaau!"
2689,10,11,Cardinal Mahoney and the Catholic clergy,"Yes, hello? It this the fire department? [the other clergy whisper and remind him what to say, he whispers back] Wait, shh, shh, shh. [normal voice] I need to make a complaint to the fire marshal. [listens for the reply] He's what? Where? [soon hangs up, having gotten nowhere] Damn your evil heart, Satan!!"
2690,10,11,Resident Bishop,What?
2691,10,11,Cardinal Mahoney and the Catholic clergy,"The Fire Marshal is at the party! Satan invited him!
Priest:
"" Satan's trickery knows no bounds! ""
Cardinal Mahoney:
"" That's it! One way or another, we're crashing this party! """
2692,10,11,Satan,"This is VIP. Don't just let anybody into my VIP area, okay? [the bouncer walks away and an elderly minion arrives]"
2693,10,11,Frank Sinatra,"Hey, Satan, you got a little problem."
2694,10,11,Satan,What?
2695,10,11,Frank Sinatra,Somebody showed up in a Crocodile Hunter costume. It's really offending some of the other guests.
2696,10,11,Satan,"Oh jeez. [walks over to the offending guest, who happens to be none other than Steve Irwin, with a stingray attached to his chest. Steve looks around with a smile on his face. Satan arrives] Hey, uh, hi, listen, dude, ya know, the whole Crocodile Hunter thing? It... it's just a little soon, you know? I mean, he just dies a few weeks ago and... it's just not supercool and you gotta leave."
2697,10,11,Steve Irwin,"But it's me, Satan. Steve Irwin. I am the Crocodile Hunter."
2698,10,11,Satan,"[thinks a moment] Oh... oh, but then, dude, no costume. Sorry, you gotta go. [two bouncers come and escort him away]"
2699,10,11,Steve Irwin,Wait! I thought we were friends!
2700,10,11,Satan,"[watches Irwin leave, then] Oh hey, Sinatra! [walks away]"
2701,10,11,Male Staffer,"Demonius! [approaches a minion wearing a Captain America outfit] Demonius, we have a problem!"
2702,10,11,Demonius,"[the pale elder demon, lifts up his mask] What is it?"
2703,10,11,Male Staffer,The Ferrari cake! It isn't here!
2704,10,11,Demonius,What?? Don't even tell me that!
2705,10,11,Male Staffer,It was never delivered to the hotel.
2706,10,11,Demonius,Deva! Fetch my Blackberry! That Ferrari cake must get here by midnight! [lowers his mask and moves on]
2707,10,11,Man,"Do you gentlemen need a hand? [Gacy and Dahmer look; Gacy runs over, jumps on him and stabs him to death with a knife. Bundy notices, jumps out of the crane and runs over]"
2708,10,11,Ted Bundy,Gacy! [Gacy jumps off the man and cleans the knife quickly] Whatcha do that foor?!
2709,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,I did it for Dahmer.
2710,10,11,Ted Bundy,For Dahmer?
2711,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,"Yeah. He likes havin' sex with dead bodies. [Dahmer is shown pumping away, from the elbow up]"
2712,10,11,Ted Bundy,Dahmer! Stop havin' sex with them intestines!
2713,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,What good are intestines if you can't have sex with them?
2714,10,11,Ted Bundy,"[slaps Dahmer hard] We gotta get rid of this body before anyone sees it! [brings out a portable saw and begins sawing the body to bits. The crane continues moving the cake around, and no one is at the controls. Bundy finishes cutting up the body] Now get those to the trashcan! [Gacy has the man's head, Dahmer has the man's left forearm and starts eating it] Stop eating that! [takes the forearm and slaps him with it.]"
2715,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,Leave him alone! [Bundy slaps him with the forearm] Unh!
2716,10,11,Ted Bundy,"Cut it! [punches Gacy in the belly] Come 'ere, ya. [takes Dahmer's right hand and places it under Gacy's chin, then forces an upper cut with his own fist]"
2717,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,Oh! [both men then take their right hands and move them up an imaginary pole]
2718,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,Oh! [both men then take their right hands and move them up an imaginary pole]
2719,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,There. [Bundy punches them both in the belly and the nose] Oh. [the cable snaps and the cake drops down a bit] The cake! [the pulley is undone and the cake flips over and hits the ground. Pieces of it fly everywhere. The three murderers are covered in it]
2720,10,11,Ted Bundy,Oh no!
2721,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,"Mmm, Ferrari."
2722,10,11,Ted Bundy,[smacks him] What's the matter with you?! It's ruined!
2723,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,We're gonna get it now.
2724,10,11,A guest,"This is a really extravagant party, Satan."
2725,10,11,Satan,"I know, but just wait till midnight. You are not gonna believe what's coming for desert! [laughs heartily]"
2726,10,11,Black Bouncer,"Uh, these aren't the right wristbands."
2727,10,11,A Bishop,"Uh, yes they are."
2728,10,11,White Bouncer,"Then how come they say ""Knott's Berry Farm""? [the clergy get restless, the bouncers hold them back]"
2729,10,11,Cardinal Mahoney and the Catholic clergy,"In the name of Christ, just let us in!"
2730,10,11,Stan,"We're really sorry, Mr. Smalls."
2731,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"Not as sorry as you're gonna be, if I completely miss the party!"
2732,10,11,Ticket agent,"Here you go, flight 72 to Los Angeles boarding in 10 minutes."
2733,10,11,Kyle,[gets the ticket and goes back to Satan] See? You can still make it for the end of the party.
2734,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"Yeah, I'm just gonna be pissed if I miss- [begins to vanish again] What the? No! No!"
2735,10,11,Randy Marsh,...Smalls. [Bigge Smalls materializes behind him] No way!
2736,10,11,Biggie Smalls,Motherfucking God-damnit!
2737,10,11,Randy Marsh,"That's pretty cool. Hey, Hey Sharon!"
2738,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"Cool this, sucka! [begins firing at Randy, who's grazed by a few bullets but runs out of the bathroom.]"
2739,10,11,Ted Bundy,"All right, listen you mugs! It's now 11:30. That means we only have twenty minutes to bake a new Ferrari cake."
2740,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,No problem! It just so happens that I went to an Italian cooking school.
2741,10,11,Ted Bundy,Yeah? Why'd you quit?
2742,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,There weren't enough Italians to eat. [a second later Bundy smacks him across the face]
2743,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,Nyak nyak nyak nyak nya-eh [Bundy moves his hand in front of Gacy and then moves it around his head] Nyaaa nyaaaa
2744,10,11,Ted Bundy,"Get over here! [pulls Gacy by the left ear. Dahmer follows. They go to a clean, ready counter] All right, what's the recipe call for first?"
2745,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,Ten thousand eggs.
2746,10,11,Ted Bundy,"Gacy, go get ten thousand eggs."
2747,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,You get 'em!
2748,10,11,Ted Bundy,[bops him on the head] Shut up!
2749,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,Nyaaaaa! [pokes Bundy in the left eye]
2750,10,11,Ted Bundy,"Oh! Ohh, wise guy, ey? [pokes both of Gacy's eyes out, leaving him with bleeding sockets]"
2751,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,GAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
2752,10,11,Ted Bundy,How's that?
2753,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,Hey! Leave him alone! [gets the knife and stabs him in the ribs]
2754,10,11,Ted Bundy,AAA!
2755,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,[sticks his tongue out at Bundy] Nehhh!
2756,10,11,Ted Bundy,Try that again!
2757,10,11,Jeffery Dahmer,[sticks his tongue out at Bundy again] Nehhh! [Bundy grabs the tongue and cuts it right out with a knife]
2758,10,11,John Wayne Gacy,What happened??
2759,10,11,Ted Bundy,"Shut up! [smacks Gacy with Dahmer's tongue. Dahmer sticks a knife in Bundy's chin, making him fall down. Gacy with loss of eyesight smacks Dahmer's head open with a rolling pin, leaving his brains pouring out]"
2760,10,11,Cowboy,"He can't do it, he can't do it."
2761,10,11,John Elway,"All right, be quiet. [laughs] Biggie Smalls... Biggie Smalls... [the others crowd in for the payoff] Oh I can't do it! I'm too freaked out. [the others laugh at him as he leaves the restroom]"
2762,10,11,Male Staffer,What do we do?? It's midnight. The Ferrari cake never arrived!
2763,10,11,Zazul,This is terrible!
2764,10,11,Demonius,[rushes up] It's okay! It's okay! [lifts up his mask] I found a backup! Go ahead and start the ceremony! [the music dies out and the lights go down]
2765,10,11,Zazul,[through the party's speakers] Your attention please: It is now midnight! Time for Satan's special surprise. [the guests gather around a raised platform]
2766,10,11,A Guest,I wonder what this is going to be.
2767,10,11,Satan,"[in a low voice, making a fist] Just you wait. [the sound of revving car engines play through the speaker system. The doors open and the surprise is revealed] Yes. Here it comes. [the car is rolled into place and begins rotating counterclockwise]"
2768,10,11,Zazul,"Ladies and gentlemen: a fully edible Acura cake! [the guests cheer, not knowing what Satan really wanted]"
2769,10,11,Satan,Acura?? But I wanted a Ferrari! [Zazul and Demonius are quickly at his side]
2770,10,11,Demonius,We did the best we could; there was a problem.
2771,10,11,Zazul,Acuras are really nice.
2772,10,11,Satan,IT'S NOT THE CAR I WANTED! THE WHOLE PARTY'S RUINED! [one swing of his left arm and Zazul flies out of the picture]
2773,10,11,Demonius,It doesn't matter. Your guests are having fun. They don't care.
2774,10,11,Satan,"[jumps up and down] IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM, IT'S ALL ABOUT MEEEEEEE!!! [his voice echoes throughout the hotel and no one says a word for several seconds]"
2775,10,11,Frank Sinatra,"Wow, what a jerk."
2776,10,11,A Cowboy,"Come on, Helen. Let's just go back to hell. I'm suddenly not so hungry for Acura cake."
2777,10,11,Satan,"Oh God, what's happened to me? I've never been this terrible before. By trying to have a party like those spoiled rich teenage girls on MTV, I've become like one of them."
2778,10,11,Zazul,"[returns] Satan, don't be so hard on yourself. You're not as bad as they are."
2779,10,11,Satan,"But I am. Throwing people out, making a big entrance, having these stupid pictures of me all over. Halloween is supposed to be for everyone. Everybody, I'm sorry. This party is for you. It's for all of you who make my life so special. If I don't realize that, then I'm no better than a rich American teenage girl. [the guest begin to applaud the speech] Open the doors! Let everyone in, wristband or no! [everyone cheers at this and the waiting guests rush in, including the Catholic clergy and their naked boys on leashes. Butters appears in the crowd and stops a catwoman powdering herself]"
2780,10,11,Butters,"Uhh, excuse me. uh ma'am, can I borrow that? [she hands him her mirror, and he looks into it] Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls Biggie Smalls. [Smalls materializes next to him]"
2781,10,11,Biggie Smalls,What the-?
2782,10,11,Butters,"Thanks. [hands the mirror back to the catwoman, and she enters the party]"
2783,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"I am soo sick of this! Wait, I'm at the party."
2784,10,11,Butters,"Sure, homie. I got your back, yo."
2785,10,11,Biggie Smalls,"[happily] And it's not too late. Hey, why don't you come in with me?"
2786,10,11,Butters,"Wull what the heck? I'm gonna get grounded anyway, might as well. [they both enter the party happily]"
2787,10,12,Eric Cartman,"[under his breath] Come ohhhn! Come ohhhn! Oh, for the love of God, how much longer?! [his mom arrives]"
2788,10,12,Liane Cartman,"There you are, Eric. What are you doing here?"
2789,10,12,Eric Cartman,I'm waiting for the new Nintendo Wii to come out.
2790,10,12,Liane Cartman,When does it come out?
2791,10,12,Eric Cartman,Three weeks. Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn!
2792,10,12,Liane Cartman,[takes him by the hand] It's time for school
2793,10,12,Eric Cartman,"[yanks his hand away and runs back to the store] No Mom, you don't understand! I've been waiting for this thing to come out for months. And now, every day time is slowing down. It's like... waiting for Christmas... times a thousand."
2794,10,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, you're just going to have to be patient. [pulls him away again]"
2795,10,12,Eric Cartman,Noo!! Nooo!!
2796,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Principal Victoria, it is wrong! [she's at the principal's office, her back to the principal's desk.] It is wrong and I simply will not do it! [walks back to the desk] I care about my students, and I will not fill their heads with lies! [pounds the desk for emphasis] I am NOT teaching evolution in my class!! [Mr. Mackey is also present]"
2797,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Mrs. Garrison, evolution is in the school curriculum. We have to teach it."
2798,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Evolution is a theory! A hare-brained theory that says I'm a monkey! I am not a monkey!! I'm a woman!
2799,10,12,Mr Mackey,"M, m'kay. Ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh... proven."
2800,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"I warn you, Principal Victoria! Those students are not prepared to hear this stuff!"
2801,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Our students want to learn, Mrs. Garrison, and they're mature enough to handle anything."
2802,10,12,Eric Cartman,How long until Nintendo Wii comes out now?!
2803,10,12,Stan Marsh,It's still three weeks.
2804,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Oh God... [shivers like someone in withdrawal] Okay, how long now?"
2805,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,Will you shut up already?! [Mrs. Garrison enters and isn't too happy about her lesson]
2806,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"All right kids, it is now my job to teach you the theory of evolution."
2807,10,12,Butters,Oh boy!
2808,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Now I, for one, think evolution is a bunch of BULL CRAP. But I've been told I have to teach it anyway. It was thought up by Charles Darwin and it goes something like this: [goes up to a large poster of evolution and begins pointing things out with her pointer.] In the beginning we were all fish. Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its [waves his left hand limply] mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this. [points to a rodent] retard frog squirrel, and then that had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you! [faces the class. A new girl is seated in the front row, looking around] So there you go! You're the retarded offspring of five monkeys having butt sex with a fish-squirrel! Congratulations!"
2809,10,12,Eric Cartman,[hopping out of his chair and running out] HEHHH! I can't take it anymore! HAAAAAH!
2810,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Yeah? You see? I knew that would happen.
2811,10,12,Eric Cartman,Come ohhhn! C-Come ohhhn! [a store clerk notices and walks over]
2812,10,12,Clerk,"Look, kid, for the fortieth time, pacing in front of the store isn't gonna make the Wii come any faster. [he goes back inside, and Liane walks up]"
2813,10,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, you're coming home right now!"
2814,10,12,Eric Cartman,Can't I just stay and... look at the sign a little longer?
2815,10,12,Liane Cartman,It's almost bedtime. If you sleep then time'll go by faster.
2816,10,12,Eric Cartman,Oh God!
2817,10,12,Eric Cartman,Agh! That does it!! I am not waiting three weeks!!
2818,10,12,Eric Cartman,"You guys! You guys! You guys, you gotta help me."
2819,10,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude you don't look so good, Cartman."
2820,10,12,Eric Cartman,"I can't take it anymore, you guys. The wait for Nintendo Wii is literally killing me."
2821,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Well there's nothing you can do, so you just have to be patient."
2822,10,12,Eric Cartman,[assertively] No. There is something I can do.
2823,10,12,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
2824,10,12,Eric Cartman,"All right, listen: you know how in space movies they put astronauts in suspender animation so that their trip seems really short, right? [turns around] I think I figured out how to do it."
2825,10,12,Stan Marsh,Do what?
2826,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Freeze myself. If I freeze myself, then in three weeks, when Nintendo Wii comes out, you guys can unfreeze me. The wait will seem instantaneous to me."
2827,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,No.
2828,10,12,Eric Cartman,"It's simple science, Kyle."
2829,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,"You'll die, retard!"
2830,10,12,Eric Cartman,I'll die waiting for the Wii to come out!! Don't you see this is my only chance!!
2831,10,12,Stan Marsh,"Dude, no way."
2832,10,12,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I hate you, but I'm not going to help kill you."
2833,10,12,Eric Cartman,"I thought you were my friends! I guess I was wrong! After everything we've been through together, you guys won't even help me freeze myself! [walks away in a huff]"
2834,10,12,Father,"Principal Victoria, we are a devout Catholic family! Do you mind telling me why my daughter now thinks she's a retarded fish-frog?!"
2835,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,"I told you this would happen, didn't I?!"
2836,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Triscotti, I wasn't aware that-"
2837,10,12,Mr Triscotti,"We have worked years to instill the teachings of Jesus Christ into our daughter, and in one fell swoop, you try to destroy everything we did!"
2838,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,I hear ya.
2839,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Sir, if you don't wish your daughter to learn about evolution, then we can pull her out of class."
2840,10,12,Mr Triscotti,You most certainly will!
2841,10,12,Daughter,"But Dad, I want to learn everything."
2842,10,12,Mr Triscotti,No you don't! Shut up! [takes his daughter and leaves the room]
2843,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,"Well, I told you. We should leave evolution out of the classrooms."
2844,10,12,Principal Victoria,It has become obvious to me that you don't know enough about evolution to teach it! I'm having you replaced! Mr. Dawkins! [Mr. Dawkins enters the office]
2845,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,Re-replaced??
2846,10,12,Principal Victoria,Richard Dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist.
2847,10,12,Mr Dawkins,[courteously] Charmed to meet you. Ms...
2848,10,12,Mrs Garrsion,"Shut up, faggot! Principal Victoria, I can teach my own class!"
2849,10,12,Principal Victoria,You are to sit in class and help Mr. Dawkins with whatever he needs!
2850,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Over billions of years life has evolved from simple one-celled organisms into all the complex life we see around us. [although all the kids have pencil and paper out ready to take notes, only Kyle is actually writing anything as Dawkins lectures. Mr. Dawkins himself delivers his lecture in a scholarly voice.]"
2851,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Whatever.
2852,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"[glances over, then continues] It was changes in hereditary traits that allowed the first mammals to breath in the air."
2853,10,12,Mrs Garrison,[relating Dawkin's points to his own] Retarded fish-frogs.
2854,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"[a bit shocked] Ms. Garrision, I believe that's a gross over-simplification."
2855,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Well, you're a faggot! [the look of shock returns to Dawkins.] Continue."
2856,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"You see, children, life has the amazing ability to change, to adapt. Like changing us to the point that we walk upright."
2857,10,12,Mrs Garrison,So you are saying that we're all related to monkeys.
2858,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"[puts the chalk in the holder below the blackboard] Well yes, basically, we are."
2859,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Do you see monkeys at the zoo?! They crap in their hands and throw it at people!
2860,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison, this isn't theory, it is scientific fact!"
2861,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"What about the fact that if I believe in this crap, you're gonna go to hell?! Doesn't that bother you a little?"
2862,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Actually, no. Because I'm an atheist."
2863,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"[rises and walks up to him] AHA! I've got you, you snake in the grass!! I found you out!!"
2864,10,12,Mr Dawkins,I never covered it up.
2865,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"And if I'm a monkey, then I might as well act like a monkey, huh?! [begins to dance around like a monkey, hooting and hollering. He lowers his pants and poops into his left hand.]"
2866,10,12,Mr Dawkins,What on earth are you doing?? [now Butters is the one taking notes]
2867,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Don't ask me, I'm a fuckin' monkey!! [throws the log of feces at Dawkins and gets him on his forehead and on the left side of his sweater]"
2868,10,12,Mr Dawkins,AAAH!
2869,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Principal Victoria, I was simply trying to make a point to Mr. Dawkins about the incongruity of some scientific statements."
2870,10,12,Principal Victoria,"Mrs. Garrison, I am pulling you out of the classroom."
2871,10,12,Mrs Garrison,What??
2872,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Principal Victoria, I really don't think that's necessary. This woman is very opinionated but, she does care about her students."
2873,10,12,Principal Victoria,Very well. But there is to be no more throwing of feces. Understood??
2874,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison. Ms. Garrison, could I have a word with you, please?"
2875,10,12,Mrs Garrison,What?!
2876,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Look, I know you think we're at war, but I want you to know I admire your passion."
2877,10,12,Mrs Garrison,[softens immediately] You d-you do?
2878,10,12,Mr Dawkins,I've never met a woman with so much... fire
2879,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Well I... [begins preening] I do bring down a woman's wrath now and again. [slight giggle]
2880,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"So much boldness in a woman. So beautiful. [snaps out of it] I'm sorry, I'm sure you have a husband, but I-"
2881,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"No! N-no! My, my husband is g-gone, dead."
2882,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Would you then... consider having dinner with me tonight?
2883,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Well, [preens again] well, I suppose we could have a little steak or something. [Dawkins smiles, Garrison smiles back]"
2884,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"I've got a date! I've got a date! My first real date with a real man since my sex-change operation! [skips away, towards the front doors] Oh boy, what'll I wear?! [opens the doors and skips out] Hey everybody!"
2885,10,12,Eric Cartman,[in the freezer] Ey!
2886,10,12,Liane Cartman,"[jumps back in surprise, dropping the ice cream] Whoa!"
2887,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Close the door, I'm trying to freeze!"
2888,10,12,Liane Cartman,"Eric, get out of there. [tries to pull him out, but he kicks her hand away]"
2889,10,12,Eric Cartman,"[resisting all of Liane's efforts] No! No, it's too soon!"
2890,10,12,Liane Cartman,"[pulls him out of the freezer] Now Eric, this has gone far enough! [sets him down and goes down on a bended knee] You need to learn to be patient!"
2891,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Butters, get your coat. We gotta go."
2892,10,12,Butters,Go where?
2893,10,12,Eric Cartman,You're gonna help me freeze myself.
2894,10,12,Butters,"[looks at Cartman a while, then] Okay. [walks away to get his coat, smiling]"
2895,10,12,Butters,"Well, how come we've gotta come all the way out here?"
2896,10,12,Eric Cartman,"[stops and begins digging ] Butters, if anyone else comes upon my frozen body, they'll try to unfreeze me right away. [finishes digging a hole, tosses the ice pick away, and prepares to step down into it] I have to be hidden. [removes his jacket and gives it to Butters] That's good. [begins to gather the snow around him and then faces Butters, who's shocked at this turn of events] And no matter what happens, Butters, you are not to unfreeze me until the day the Nintendo Wii comes out. Do you got it?!"
2897,10,12,Butters,"Eric, are you sure this is a good idea?"
2898,10,12,Eric Cartman,"No, it's not a good idea. It's an awesome idea"
2899,10,12,Butters,"[not so sure, casts his eyes down] Yeah...I guess it is..."
2900,10,12,Eric Cartman,"All right, you got the spot figured out? You're not gonna lose where I am, right?"
2901,10,12,Butters,I got it. [looks around] Big Tree. Oval Rock.
2902,10,12,Eric Cartman,"All right, now get out of here. You can't freeze too, or else we're both screwed. [Butters looks at Cartman once more, then leaves. Butters turns to look at Cartman again] Get out of here, you asshole! You're gonna ruin everything!"
2903,10,12,Butters,Oh jeez! [turns around and walks away quickly]
2904,10,12,Eric Cartman,[all alone now] Yes. Come on. Freeeze. Freeeze.
2905,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"So I told my gynecologist, ""you put so many things in my vagina, maybe I should charge you!"" [they both laugh at the story.]"
2906,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Oh, Ms. Garrison, you are the most outspoken woman I have ever met! It's almost like you're one of the guys."
2907,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Hehyeah, almost."
2908,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"You have so much spunk, so much life... If only you were an atheist."
2909,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Well... Well, you know, I'm... I'm open to stuff."
2910,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Why is someone as outspoken as you given themselves over to the whole God thing?
2911,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Oh I'm not... I'm not totally into the whole God thing. I just... I just think, you know, you can't disprove God."
2912,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Well what if I told you there was a flying spaghetti monster: Would you believe it simply because it can't be disproven?
2913,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"[Thinks a moment] You're riiight. It's so simple! God is a spaghetti monster. Oh thank you, jeez! My eyes are opened! [stands up] Hey everyone, I'm an atheist!"
2914,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Really?? Oh that's wonderful!
2915,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"No, I totally get it now! Evolution explains everything! There is no great mystery to life, just evolution and God's a spaghetti monster! Thank you, Richard!"
2916,10,12,Mr Dawkins,You're so welcome!
2917,10,12,Mrs Garrison,Would you like tuh... [preens again] head over to my place for dessert?
2918,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!"
2919,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Oh Ms. Garrison!
2920,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Yeah, pound my monkey hole, Richard! Yeah, I'm a monkey all right!"
2921,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Nin-ten-do. I'm coming. I'm coming, Nin-ten-do."
2922,10,12,Medic,"We have a pulse. [Cartman comes to, coughs, and sits up. The aliens gather around]"
2923,10,12,Alien 1,Can you... understand me?
2924,10,12,Eric Cartman,Where am I?
2925,10,12,Shvek,My name is Shvek. You are safe.
2926,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Safe where, butthole?!"
2927,10,12,Shvek,"My friend, this is going to be a bit of a shock, but... it is the year 2546."
2928,10,12,Eric Cartman,[looks around] What??
2929,10,12,Shvek,"You have been frozen in ice for over 500 years. [Cartman jumps off the bed and runs to the nearest window, where he sees a city unlike any he's seen before.]"
2930,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Butters? Butters, you black asshole?! [suddenly looks tired.]"
2931,10,12,Medic,Please be careful. You are frail.
2932,10,12,Eric Cartman,Is the Wii out? Where's the Wii?
2933,10,12,Analyst,"[brings up a holoscreen and presses a few buttons on it. A picture of the Wii appears] Ahh, Nintendo Wii. A primitive gaming device used in his time."
2934,10,12,Eric Cartman,"Primitive? It has motion-control controllers, asswipe!"
2935,10,12,Medic,"Young man, you don't seem to understand. [goes down on one knee] Your family, your friends, everyone you knew, has been dead for over 500 years."
2936,10,12,Eric Cartman,I don't care! Is there a Nintendo Wii!
2937,10,12,Shvek,We don't play videogames in our time. There's no such thing as a Nintendo Wii.
2938,10,12,Eric Cartman,No... [looks up at the ceiling and] NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!
2939,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"You must understand, children, that we are dealing with VERY large numbers here."
2940,10,12,Mrs Garrison,[thinking] That's my man.
2941,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"So, evolution doesn't even happen by chance. It is, in fact, bound to happen."
2942,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"That's right, kids. And so you see, there is no God."
2943,10,12,Mr Dawkins,Careful darling. The school board doesn't like it when we-
2944,10,12,Stan Marsh,Well there could still be a god.
2945,10,12,Mrs Garrison,What?!
2946,10,12,Stan Marsh,Couldn't evolution be the answer to how and not the answer to why?
2947,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"[brings out a triangle and starts ringing it] Uh oh, retard alert! Retard alert, class! [leaves her desk and walks up to Stan's] Do you believe in a flying spaghetti monster too, bubblehead?!"
2948,10,12,Stan Marsh,"I wasn't talking about spaghetti. [Mrs. Garrison picks him up, desk and all, and carries him to the front of the class.]"
2949,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Come on, you. You're gonna have to sit in the dunce chair! [sets him down next to the blackboard, goes for a dunce cap, and places it on Stan's head. The cap reads ""I HAVE FAITH""]"
2950,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Ms. Garrison, I'm not so sure what you did in class today was right."
2951,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"What?? But Dick, you told me the world would be a better place without religion."
2952,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Yes, but to be so bold about it... [looks away] I've just never seen a woman with such... balls."
2953,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"[gets up and sits on Mr. Dawkins with the blanket over her chest] You've just been too soft on religious people in the past. Think about it, Richard. With your intellect and my balls, we can change the future of the world."
2954,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Can you imagine a world with no religion? No Muslims killing Jews, no Christians bombing abortion clinics. The world would be a wonderful place... without God."
2955,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"You're the smartest man on earth, Dick. With me by your side, there's no stopping you."
2956,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Oh, just let me see those beautiful breasts again."
2957,10,12,Mrs Garrison,"Oh, all right. [lowers the blanket and the breasts appear. The implants... are not balanced. The left nipple is huge and lower compared to the right one, and the stitches are still visible.]"
2958,10,12,Mr Dawkins,"Oh yeah, baby! Oh-hm. [begins to shake his head between the breasts, which has the effect of a motorboat's engine revving up.]"
2959,10,12,Mrs Garrison,OHOH YEAH!! AHHH!! [Mr. Dawkins revs up again]
2960,10,12,Butters,"Quick, General Disarray! Kill those superheroes!"
2961,10,12,Dougie,[fires at the action figures] Pehpew Pehpew! [walks over and kicks them down]
2962,10,12,Butters,Yes! Now the world shall feel the wrath of Professor Chaos! Hahaha!
2963,10,12,Linda Stotch,"Butters? [she appears at the sliding door entrance with two policemen behind her] Butters, you haven't seen Eric Cartman in the past few days, have you?"
2964,10,12,Butters,"[a bit afraid, slowly] Who, me?"
2965,10,12,Linda Stotch,"It's very importance, Butters. He's missing. You haven't seen or heard from him?"
2966,10,12,Butters,"[looks right, then left, trying to figure out what to say...] No ma'am."
2967,10,12,Linda Stotch,Okay. [closes the sliding door and walks away with the officers]
2968,10,12,Dougie,"Come on, Professor Chaos! Let's destroy this anthill! [Butters turns and joins him]"
2969,10,12,Butters,"Geh-General Disarray, can I ask you a scientific question?"
2970,10,12,Dougie,Okay.
2971,10,12,Butters,"Well, um, can... Can anything bad happen if you completely freeze yourself and then unfreeze yourself three weeks later?"
2972,10,12,Dougie,[long pause] ...Yeah.
2973,10,12,Butters,"Well, like what?"
2974,10,12,Dougie,"...Like, you die."
2975,10,12,Butters,...Die??
2976,10,12,Dougie,"Well yeah. If you freeze your body, it means you die. When you wake up three weeks later you can be unfrozen, but you're still dead."
2977,10,12,Butters,Oh hamburgers!! [runs away]
2978,10,12,Butters,Eric! Erihic!
2979,10,12,Dougie,You just left him here?! Without a jacket or anything?!
2980,10,12,Butters,He told me to!
2981,10,12,Dougie,He's dead for sure.
2982,10,12,Butters,Wait! [looks around.] It's all different. Nothing's in the same place!
2983,10,12,Dougie,Oh my God...
2984,10,12,Butters,"[begins to dig frantically] Uh, eh, Eric! Eric!"
2985,10,12,Dougie,[trying to stop him] Butters ButterButterBUTTERS! [Butters stops and looks at him] We have to get out of here!
2986,10,12,Butters,What??
2987,10,12,Dougie,"Nobody is ever going to find his body. You've got to never say anything about this, do you understand?! He's dead, and if they know you had a hand in it, you'll go to jail! [runs off]"
2988,10,12,Butters,But I just did what he told me!
2989,10,12,Dougie,"Come on, we have to leave!!"
2990,10,12,Butters,Oh jumping Jesus! [follows Dougie. They head back to town]
2991,10,12,Eric Cartman,This is terrible. Five hundred years in the future. [puts his head in his hands and starts to weep. A door slides open and three of the aliens enter the room]
2992,10,12,Shvek,"Eric, I have good news for you. We may have found you a Nintendo Wii."
2993,10,12,Eric Cartman,What?? [hops onto the desk] Really?? [jumps down and exults] YES!! YES!!
2994,10,12,Medic,It's rumored that there's one at the Museum of Technology at New New Hampshire.
2995,10,12,Eric Cartman,"So I'm not too late! Come on, let's go!"
2996,10,12,Shvek,"Well, there's just... th-there's something we need from you first."
2997,10,12,Shvek,"You see, my young friend, you were unfrozen for a reason."
2998,10,12,Medic,Lots of people froze themselves in cryogenic labs and we don't unfreeze them. But you... are special.
2999,10,12,Eric Cartman,I know I'm special. This isn't news to me.
3000,10,12,Shvek,"You lived in a time when a great event happened. A glorious event that finally made all religion obsolete. Now, the entire world is atheist."
3001,10,12,Eric Cartman,[strokes his chin and thinks] And this gives me a Nintendo Wii how?
3002,10,12,Medic,We believe that somebody you knew in your time was the person who first started our wonderful group: The Unified Atheist League.
3003,10,12,Eric Cartman,Who? [the medic is about to reply when something shakes the building they're in]
3004,10,12,Shvek,"What in Science's name was that?! [outside, an enemy ship first at the building and leaves a hole in it. The ship docks at that hole and the invaders pour into a cargo room. The UAL members and Cartman enter the cargo room at the other end.]"
3005,10,12,Medic,Oh no! It's the United Atheist Alliance!
3006,10,12,Shvek,"Oh Science, help us! [a laser battle between the two groups begins]"
3007,10,12,UAA Member 1,"[yellow hair, green suit] Science damn you, Unified Atheist League!"
3008,10,12,Eric Cartman,Who are they??
3009,10,12,Shvek,"The Alliance Atheists. We're at war with them. [the battle rages on, with laser shots going back and forth. The laser shots turn out to be syringes which inject the victim with poison. Once the load is fully inside the body, the head explodes. Men on both sides explode and die.]"
3010,10,12,UAL Member 1,[a syringe gets him] No! [his head explodes]
3011,10,12,Eric Cartman,Jesus Christ!
3012,10,12,Shvek,"Hahahaha, you believe in a supernatural being. [gets a syringe to the neck] Oh my Science. [his head explodes and the battle is over. The UAA closes in on Cartman, its guns drawn]"
3013,10,12,Eric Cartman,I'm just a little boy from the past who wants to play Nintendo Wii.
3014,10,12,UAA Member 1,Put me through to the Allied Atheist Allegiance!
3015,10,12,UAA Member 2,[black hair] Onscreen.
3016,10,12,UAA Member 1,"Look, Allied Atheist Allegiance! We have the time child!"
3017,10,12,AAA Leader,"Science damn you, United Atheist Alliance!"
3018,10,12,UAA Member 1,"Now you see, foolish sea otters, that we are the atheists in control!"
3019,10,12,AAA Leader,"It won't make a difference! This is the dawning of the sea otter! Know this, time child! I shall smash your skull like a clam on my tummy!"
3020,10,12,Eric Cartman,What??
3021,10,12,AAA Leader,Otters! The time has come! Sound the nafferty!
3022,10,12,Sea Otters,The nafferty! [a giant otter walks over to a very fanciful horn and blows into it.]
3023,10,12,AAA Leader,"[rises on a platform and turns around. A lens drops down from a contraption he has to his left ear and lands on his nose] So, it begins!"
3024,10,13,Narrator,"The year is 2006, and young Eric Cartman cannot wait for the new Nintendo Wii to come out. Unable to cope with the wait any longer, Eric decides to freeze himself for three weeks. But a freak avalanche makes Eric impossible to find, and so he remains frozen for 500 years."
3025,10,13,Otter Leader,"Whoa, steady! [motions to the otters] This way, otters! [other otters move forward on their ostriches]"
3026,10,13,Otter 1,"This is it. New New Hampshire. We have risked much bringing you here, Time Child. [the camera pans left to show Cartman on an ostrich and wearing goggles.]"
3027,10,13,Cartman,"Can it. You otters may have evolved to the point you can talk, but I don't need lectures."
3028,10,13,Otter 1,Don't let the time child out of your sight. He could try to run.
3029,10,13,Cartman,"[goggles now above his eyes] We have a deal, Blavius. As long as I get what I want, you have nothin' to worry about. [the leader's ostrich makes a noise]"
3030,10,13,Otter Leader,Something is spooking the ostriches.
3031,10,13,Cartman,Sure. This is Monarch land now. Probably Jarvis probes everywhere.
3032,10,13,Otter Leader,Here it is! We have arrived.
3033,10,13,Blavius,"[Sea Otter 1] Hold! [the ostriches stop at a large entrance] This is it, Time Child. [the building's name is shown: New New Hampshire Museum of Technology] The old museum of technology, abandoned long ago. Let's get what you want, Time Child, and get out of here."
3034,10,13,Cartman,Over here! [runs over to it] Yeah it's here! It's here! The Nintendo Wii... I've waited so long for this. [shatters the glass case protecting it and removes it]
3035,10,13,Blavius,"All right, Time Child, we've filled our side of the bargain. Now return with us to Otter Bay."
3036,10,13,Cartman,"Sorry Blavius. I've got other plans. [switches hands in holding the Wii, presses a button on his left glove and disappears]"
3037,10,13,Blavius,NOOOO!
3038,10,13,Otter Leader,It was a trick!
3039,10,13,Blavius,"SCIENCE DAMN YOU, TIME CHILD!"
3040,10,13,Cartman,I got it! I got the Wii!
3041,10,13,UAA Leader,Time Child! You've returned!
3042,10,13,UAA 1,We thought for sure you had died in the in the Phobart plant.
3043,10,13,Cartman,"[turns and leaves the transporter pad] Yeah. Lucky for me the otters believed I was on their side. [turns around as he reaches the door] Do me a favor: next time I'm in a recessed biocave, don't send me a level 2 homing call. [the door opens and Cartman walks into the hallway outside the room. The leader and his assistant look at each other]"
3044,10,13,UAA Leader,"TC, wait!"
3045,10,13,Cartman,[ruonds a corner] Oh I can't wait! This is gonna be so awesome! [almost walks into another UAA member] Get out of my way!
3046,10,13,UAA Leader,[catches up with Cartman] You gained the otters' trust?! Were you wearing an information crystal?!
3047,10,13,Cartman,Here. [takes off the information crystal and hands it to him]
3048,10,13,UAA 1,Science be praised. This could end the war!
3049,10,13,UAA Leader,"You've done a great thing, TC. [Cartman turns right...] How can we repay you?"
3050,10,13,Cartman,[...and enters an elevator] Just send a maintenance guy to my room. I want this Nintendo hooked up to my float screen NOW! [the doors close]
3051,10,13,Cartman,"Come on! Come on! Dude, what is taking so long! I wanna play!"
3052,10,13,Maintenance Guy,"Uhh, what kind of output does this have? This is some ancient Super-VHS output or somethin'. I can't connect it to your float screen."
3053,10,13,Cartman,There's gotta be some way to hook it up! It's the freakin' future!
3054,10,13,Maintenance Guy,"It may be the future for you, but I can't hook up anything to a float screen without at least a laser-7 output."
3055,10,13,Cartman,"You've gotta be shittin' me!! Science-dammit! I am so fucking sick of the future! [starts throwing a tantrum, throwing things around]"
3056,10,13,UAA Woman,[entering the room] TC? What's wrong?
3057,10,13,Cartman,"I'll tell you what's wrong! I've been waiting 500 years to play the Nintendo Wii! And if I don't get to play real soon, I'm gonna bust a nut!"
3058,10,13,UAA Woman,"Well, we're all glad you're back. I know somebody who's missed you very much. Come on in, K-10. [steps aside to reveal K-10, who walks in]"
3059,10,13,K 1,"Bark bark. Hello, Eric. I have missed you."
3060,10,13,Cartman,"Suck my balls, K-10. I'm not in the mood."
3061,10,13,UAA Leader,"Fellow atheists: the time child has returned with information on our sworn enemies, the Allied Atheist Alliance. They have started digging for clams in sector J7. If we mount an all-out attack, we can wipe out their food supply!"
3062,10,13,UAA 2,"But, those are civilian otters."
3063,10,13,UAA Leader,We cannot tolerate the otters! Their Science is flawed! Their answer to the Great Question is different from ours.
3064,10,13,UAA 3,"Yes, but... sending out all our ships at the same time... it would leave our city exposed!"
3065,10,13,UAA Leader,...That's why we have to be super-duper sure that nobody finds out we're doing it.
3066,10,13,UAL 1,[hanging upside down from a jet-powered platform] The United Atheist Alliance is about to send out all its defense ships to take down the Allied Atheist Alliance's clam fields.
3067,10,13,UAL 2,"Praise Science. This is your chance, young Shvek, to avenge your father's death."
3068,10,13,UAL 3,"Careful, son. Just because their Science leads them to a different answer to the Great Question doesn't mean we have the right to kill them all."
3069,10,13,Shvek and the UAL,"No! Our answer to the Great Question is the only logical one. Our Science is great. [walks away from the table and stands before a wall] Let us not forget the great Richard Dawkins who finally freed the world of religion long ago. [a painting is shown, with Dawkins in it] Dawkins knew that logic and reason were the way of the future. [More of the painting is shown: Mrs. Garrison appears] But it wasn't until he met his beautiful wife that he learned using logic and reason isn't enough. You have to be a dick to everyone who doesn't think like you. [turns around] Prepare all the troops! We will level the United Atheist Alliance to the ground!"
3070,10,13,Announcer,"With new Glade monvert cleaner, you can make your monvert sparkle like never before."
3071,10,13,Woman,"My monvert's never looked so clean. [apparently, a monvert is a phallic device]"
3072,10,13,Cartman,"God I hate future TV. There's too many commercials! [switches channels. A picture appears briefly in which a reporter is about to mention an attack, but that vanishes. Three bored kids appear seated at a coffee table]"
3073,10,13,Boy 1,Agh! I'm so bored.
3074,10,13,Boy 2,There's nothing to do.
3075,10,13,Cartman,Tell me about it.
3076,10,13,Boy 3,"Hey, I know! Let's crank call people in the past!"
3077,10,13,Boy 1,Huh?
3078,10,13,Boy 3,I just got... [brings out a big box] the Crank Prank Time Phone! [the other two boys marvel at it]
3079,10,13,Singers,"Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone."
3080,10,13,Announcer,"New, from Blasbro, it's Crank Prank Time Phone!"
3081,10,13,Boy Announcer,"I just dial a random number on the keypad, enter a date and year on the debilibrator, and..."
3082,10,13,Boy 1,"Wow! Someone from the past is on the line! [talks into the phone] Hello? Is there a refrigerator running? Well then, you'd better go catch it! [the boys have a good laugh]"
3083,10,13,Singers,"Crank Prank, Crank Prank Time Phone."
3084,10,13,Cartman,[now interested] What?
3085,10,13,Boy 2,"Uh hi. It's the year 1973, right? Could I speak to Al Coholic, please? [the boys laugh again]"
3086,10,13,Announcer,"Crank Prank Time Phone comes with debilibrator [looks like a space-age microphone], antimatter fusion cone, and 30 plain HF watt triggers. Warning: Crank Prank Time Phone is for entertainment purposes only. Making anything OTHER than crank calls to the past could affect the present and end your existence. Crank Prank Time Phone is not intended for the use by otters."
3087,10,13,Cartman,Why didn't anyone tell me there was a time phone?!
3088,10,13,K 1,Why does it matter? Bark bark
3089,10,13,Cartman,"Don't you see?? If I get one of those phones, I can call myself in the past and tell me not to freeze myself. [walks forward a few steps] Then I can go back into my time... and play Nintendo Wii."
3090,10,13,K 1,Bark bark. That call is for crank calling only. Using it in the way you describe is illegal.
3091,10,13,Cartman,I care! Where's the closest toy store??
3092,10,13,K 1,"Working, bark bark. The Jarvanian shopping complex. But it is not open yet."
3093,10,13,Cartman,Come on! Come on!
3094,10,13,Voice,Store is now... open. [the storefront lights up like a Christmas tree and the doors open] Welcome
3095,10,13,Cartman,"Ugh, finally!"
3096,10,13,Clerk,Welcome to Zeebod's Toys
3097,10,13,Cartman,I want one of those time-phone things.
3098,10,13,Clerk,"Ahh, the Crank Prank Time Phone. Sure. Now, I am required by the state to make sure you know this is for prank-calling the past ONLY, right?"
3099,10,13,Cartman,"Yeah yeah, I'm only gonna prank-call people."
3100,10,13,Clerk,"[pulls up a small float screen and calculates the cost on it] All right, that'll be 6000 credits. [a second float screen pops up with the price on it]"
3101,10,13,Cartman,Six thousand credits?! What do I look like to you? A Thurilian miner?!
3102,10,13,Clerk,This is a pretty advanced piece of equipment. It's expensive.
3103,10,13,Cartman,"Look, I have to have one of those phones!"
3104,10,13,Clerk,"Oh, all right, then I have to have 6000 credits. [Eric sighs and looks down]"
3105,10,13,K 1,"Bark bark, I'm sorry, Eric, bark bark."
3106,10,13,Cartman,How about a robot? How much for the robot?
3107,10,13,K 1,Awww.
3108,10,13,Clerk,"[puts the phone away] Sorry, kid, you're just gonna have to crank-call people in the present."
3109,10,13,Cartman,"[turns around and walks away. K-10 follows] Science-dammit! [stops] Wait. K-10, can you access the store's sales records?"
3110,10,13,K 1,"Working, bark bark. Access."
3111,10,13,Cartman,I want the name and address of anybody who's bought a time phone from this guy in the past week.
3112,10,13,K 1,"Working, bark bark."
3113,10,13,Blavius,"The United Atheist Alliance has taken the bait! Soon they will send their ships out to destroy our decoy clam fields! And while their ships are away, the United Atheist League intends to attack them! Our plan has worked perfectly! For when the United Atheist League attacks the United Atheist Alliance, we will charge in and kill them all! Our Science, our answer to the Great Question shall prevail!"
3114,10,13,Otters,Hail Science! Hail Science! Hail Science!
3115,10,13,Blavius,"And I will personally kill the Time Child, and eat his entrails on my tummy!"
3116,10,13,Man from the early 20th century,"I'll get it, darling. [approaches the phone and picks up the receiver. His wife goes back to vacuuming] Hello? Hello?"
3117,10,13,Boy 4,"Uh yes, hello? I'm calling for Mr. Wall?"
3118,10,13,Man from the early 20th century,"I;m sorry, there's no Mr. Wall here."
3119,10,13,Boy 4,Oh. Is Mrs. Wall there?
3120,10,13,Man from the early 20th century,"Nno, there are no Walls here."
3121,10,13,Boy 4,Then how does your roof stay up? [he and his friend begin to laugh]
3122,10,13,Man from the early 20th century,"Oh, I see! Is this the Johnson boys from down the street?!"
3123,10,13,Boy 4,"No, we're from the future. [stifled laughter]"
3124,10,13,Man from the early 20th century,Very funny!
3125,10,13,Boy 5,"Hi, uh, I'm a Pepper, and I'm wondering if you'd like to be a Pepper too?"
3126,10,13,Man from the early 20th century,God darn ya! [hangs up. The two boys laugh]
3127,10,13,Boy 4,Yeah.
3128,10,13,Boy 5,"That was a great one! [the doorbell rings and Boy 4 gets up to answer it. Cartman, dressed as a maintenance man, and K-10 appear at the entrance]"
3129,10,13,Cartman,"Hello, I'm with the cubic waste department. I need to check your lowertram for inhibitors."
3130,10,13,Boy 4,"Oh. Okay, I guess."
3131,10,13,Cartman,"[steps inside] Come on in, Bob. [K-10 enters the room] All right, just let me use my tools... [pulls out a gun and fires at Boy 4, who is instantly trapped in a bubble, floating in the air. K-10 does the same to Boy 5.]"
3132,10,13,Boy 5,Hey!
3133,10,13,Cartman,[walks up and takes the time phone from the coffee table] Haha! Stupid assholes! I got your time phone! [walks out the door with K-10]
3134,10,13,Boy 4,Science H. Logic! What a jerk!
3135,10,13,The Wise One,"[walks in with a cane] Silence, otters!"
3136,10,13,Otter 1,It's the Wise One
3137,10,13,Otter 2,The Wise One speaks.
3138,10,13,The Wise One,This is not the path we should be taking. Will more bloodshed end anything?
3139,10,13,Blavius,"[floats up to him on a hovering throne] Wise One, our answer to the Great Question is the only one based on good science."
3140,10,13,The Wise One,"Science, reason, is that really all there is?"
3141,10,13,Blavius,"They are not a logical race, Wise One! They go around chopping down trees for tables, when they have perfectly good tummies to eat on. How logical is that?!"
3142,10,13,Otter Leader,Yes! [walks up to a painting of Dawkins and Garrison] The great Dawkins said we cannot tolerate those who don't use reason! How reasonable is it to eat off wood instead of your tummy?
3143,10,13,The Wise One,"Well perhaps the great Dawkins wasn't so wise. Oh, he was intelligent, but, some of the most intelligent otters I've ever known were completely lacking in common sense. Maybe, some otters do need to believe in something. Who knows? Maybe, just believing in God makes God exist."
3144,10,13,Otter Soldier,Kill the Wise One!
3145,10,13,Otter 3,Kill the Wise One! [the other otters crowd him in and start attacking]
3146,10,13,The Wise One,"Whoa, wait wait! [perishes amid the pummeling]"
3147,10,13,Cartman,"Oh God! [throws himself back on the bed and squeezes his eyes shut. This time, the phone rings. He gets up to answer it. The caller is the Time Child] Hello? [he gets static until...]"
3148,10,13,Time Child,[in a higher pitch] Hello? [Cartman is surprised to hear his own voice on the other end] Are you there?
3149,10,13,Cartman,Who is this?
3150,10,13,Time Child,"[to K-10] No, no, I have me. [to his past self] All right, all right, listen! Listen to me carefully! You need to be patient!"
3151,10,13,Cartman,What?? Who the hell is this?!
3152,10,13,Time Child,It's me.
3153,10,13,Cartman,Me who?!
3154,10,13,Time Child,Me you!
3155,10,13,Cartman,What?!
3156,10,13,Time Child,"I'm you in the future! You have to be patient and wait for the Nintendo Wii to come out, or else you'll wake up in the future and have to deal with a bunch of see otters!"
3157,10,13,Cartman,"Oh very funny, Kyle!"
3158,10,13,Time Child,"It's not Kyle, it's you!"
3159,10,13,Cartman,Yeah? Well you can go fuck yourself.
3160,10,13,Time Child,"I'm trying to do you a favor, dumb-ass!! Just listen to me!"
3161,10,13,Cartman,"Listen to this! [puts the phone to his ass and farts into it, then slams the phone down on its base] Dickhead. [the phone rings again. Cartman picks it up and quickly slams it down again.]"
3162,10,13,Time Child,[surprised at his own reaction in the past] What an asshole!
3163,10,13,Butters,Hello? [he gets static until...]
3164,10,13,Time Child,Butters? Butters!
3165,10,13,Butters,Eric? Is that you?
3166,10,13,Time Child,"Butters, Butters! Listen to me! Just just listen. I'm about to come over to your house and ask you to help me freeze myself. Do not... do t!"
3167,10,13,Butters,"[looks around unsure what to make of this strange call] Eric, are you playing a joke on me again?"
3168,10,13,Time Child,"No! This is not a joke! Whatever I say to you, Butters, no matter how hard I try, do not... do... what I tell you!"
3169,10,13,Butters,But... [notices Cartman entering through the front door] but you're here right now. [Cartman walks into view]
3170,10,13,Cartman,"Butters?! Come on, we gotta go!"
3171,10,13,Time Child,[hearing his past self] No! Don't listen to me! Tell me to go screw myself!
3172,10,13,Butters,Huh??
3173,10,13,Cartman,"Come on, Butters, it's gonna get dark!"
3174,10,13,Butters,"But, you're telling me not to go with you."
3175,10,13,Cartman,What?? [enters the kitchen to talk to his future self] Who the fuck is this?!
3176,10,13,Time Child,"Aw dammit, just listen to me! If you freeze yourself, you're going to die!"
3177,10,13,Cartman,Suck my balls!
3178,10,13,Time Child,"No, you suck my balls!! Just listen to me for one minute!"
3179,10,13,Cartman,"...Okay, you have one minute."
3180,10,13,Time Child,"Right before you left for Butters' house, you drank a buncha Ovaltine and put Clyde Frog in the closet so nothing would happen to him, right?"
3181,10,13,Cartman,[shocked] Are you spying on me?!
3182,10,13,Time Child,"No, I am you, you stupid asshole!"
3183,10,13,Cartman,"Fuck you, asshole. You can go fuck yourself! [hangs up and pulls his hood back over his head] Come on, Butters, we're going!"
3184,10,13,Butters,"Oh, all right then."
3185,10,13,Time Child,[frustrated] God I hate that guy!!
3186,10,13,UAA Leader,"My friends, the time has come! May Science give us the courage to do what we must! Launch all defensive ships to sector J7! Take out the otters' clam fields! [a fleet of UAA ships takes off]"
3187,10,13,UAL Aide,Sir! The United Atheist Alliance has sent out all their ships. Their capital is now unprotected.
3188,10,13,UAL Leader,[turns and issues the command] Then begin the attack! Science be praised.
3189,10,13,Otter Leader,Kill the table-eaters! In the name of Almighty Science! [the otters ride on]
3190,10,13,Kyle,Hello? [he gets static until...]
3191,10,13,Time Child,Hello? Kyle?
3192,10,13,Kyle,Hello?
3193,10,13,Time Child,"Yes. Hello, Kyle. It's Eric. Uh, how's it going?"
3194,10,13,Kyle,What do you want?!
3195,10,13,Time Child,"Kyle, you are the smartest guy I know, so I think maybe you're the only person who can understand this. You know how earlier today I asked you to help me freeze myself?"
3196,10,13,Kyle,"I'm not going to help you freeze yourself, Cartman! It's a stupid idea!"
3197,10,13,Time Child,"No, see, I know it's a stupid idea. Because, I actually did freeze myself.and... you were right, Kyle. It it backfired and I was frozen for 500 years, and now I'm calling you from the future."
3198,10,13,Kyle,[with half-closed eyes] ... Uh huh.
3199,10,13,Time Child,"No, really, Kyle, I'm I'm seriously. Here, talk to my robot dog. [backs up to hand the phone to K-10.]"
3200,10,13,K 1,"Bark bark. Hello, Kyle. Bark bark."
3201,10,13,Kyle,... I'm hanging up now.
3202,10,13,Time Child,"No, Kyle, listen! Please! I think right about now, I'm in my mom's freezer."
3203,10,13,Kyle,"Suck my balls, fatass."
3204,10,13,Time Child,"... I will. I will suck your balls, Kyle. Just stop me from freezing myself, and I will get down on my knees, and I will suck your balls. I'll suck 'em dry, Kyle. [a car honks its horn at Kyle's end and he looks over. It leaves]"
3205,10,13,Kyle,"Aw Goddammit, now you've made me miss my ride! My whole day is screwed up because of you! [hangs up]"
3206,10,13,Time Child,"Kyle? [as he asks, everything around him changes. His float screen goes from red to green, his suit goes from blue to saffron with light blue cape, the plant turns leafy, and the floor goes from orange to navy] Kyle!"
3207,10,13,KIT 9,"[K-10's new look] Eric, I really think you should stop calling the past. You could change the present."
3208,10,13,Time Child,"Well I don't notice anything different, KIT-9! Do you?"
3209,10,13,KIT 9,"I guess not, meow meow."
3210,10,13,Time Child,"[begins to notice the differences] Hm, I see... [the building is shaken hard by something striking it] Hey!"
3211,10,13,KIT 9,Meow meow. [the UAL ships swarm in and fire at all the buildings in UAA territory]
3212,10,13,Time Child,Heeeeey!
3213,10,13,KIT 9,Meow meow.
3214,10,13,UAA Woman,TC! We're under attack!
3215,10,13,Time Child,By who?!
3216,10,13,UAA Woman,We have to get to the War Room! It's the only safe place!
3217,10,13,UAA Leader,The United Atheist League is bombing the city! We're defenseless!
3218,10,13,Cartman,This is terrible! I'm gonna die in the future without ever playing Nintendo Wii?!
3219,10,13,Tactical Officer,Sir! The sea otters are advancing! They've broken through the east portal!
3220,10,13,UAA Leader,"What?! Three-way phone channel onscreen! [the main screen lights up with two windows. On the left window appear the UAL leader and the UAL, on the right window appear Blavius and the otters]"
3221,10,13,Shvek and the UAL,[from UAL headquarters] What are you otters doing?! This is our attack!
3222,10,13,Blavius,[from AAA headquarters] Yes. And we're attacking both of you!
3223,10,13,UAA Leader,You fools! This will be the end of us all!
3224,10,13,Blavius,"Then accept our answer to the Great Question, and we will withdraw."
3225,10,13,UAA Leader,Your answer to the Great Question is illogical!
3226,10,13,Cartman,What is the Great Question?
3227,10,13,KIT 9,What atheists should call themselves.
3228,10,13,Shvek and the UAL,Unified Atheist League is the most logical name.
3229,10,13,UAA Leader,>Unified Atheist Alliance makes more sense.
3230,10,13,Blavius,No! Allied Atheist Alliance! That way it has three A's! That is the logical choice!
3231,10,13,Shvek and the UAL,So be it. We cannot agree; prepare to die.
3232,10,13,Tactical Officer,"Forward missiles launched, sir!"
3233,10,13,Cartman,I have to get out of here! Why is everyone in my past so stupid that they think I'm crank-calling them?!
3234,10,13,KIT 9,"But Eric, meow meow, you knew the wife of the smartest man in history."
3235,10,13,Cartman,Who?
3236,10,13,KIT 9,"Your teacher, the one called Garrison."
3237,10,13,Cartman,Garrison? But he's an asshole.
3238,10,13,Mrs Garrison,"Oh yeah! Yeah, I'm a monkey! Give this monkey what she wants!"
3239,10,13,Mr Dawkins,Oh Ms. Garrison!
3240,10,13,Mrs Garrison,"Dammit, who the hell is calling?!"
3241,10,13,Mr Dawkins,"I'll tell them... to call you back... Oh... yeah... [answers the phone] Garrison residence. Can you call... back later, please?"
3242,10,13,Cartman,It's an emergency! It's an emergency!
3243,10,13,Mr Dawkins,[stops] An emergency?
3244,10,13,Cartman,I need to speak to Mr. Garrison right now!
3245,10,13,Mr Dawkins,"I'm sorry, but Mr. Garrison has passed away. Mrs. Garrison is the only person here and she's rather tied up at the moment."
3246,10,13,Cartman,"Look asshole, this is a real emergency! Just pass the phone to whatever Garrison wants to call himself since the sex-change operation!"
3247,10,13,Mr Dawkins,Sex-change operation??
3248,10,13,Mrs Garrison,Uh oh.
3249,10,13,Mr Dawkins,[pulls out and protects his genitals] Uuuuugh! You're a man?!
3250,10,13,Mrs Garrison,"Not anymore. I've been fixed. [Dawkins runs for his clothes] Richard, hold on. I can explain."
3251,10,13,Mr Dawkins,"Explain?? How can I be so stupid?? [runs out of the house with his pants on, carrying the rest of his clothes]"
3252,10,13,Mrs Garrison,"Richard, come back, please! [Dawkins does NOT return, and Garrison loses her faith in atheism in a flash] Well go ahead and leave, you atheist faggot! Have fun mocking God in hell! You queer!"
3253,10,13,Cartman,"Mr. Garrison! Mr. Garrison! [Cartman's present changes again, and now he's wearing a gray suit with orange cape. Also, he's back at UAL headquarters, which is quiet and undamaged]"
3254,10,13,Shvek and the UAL,"[enters from a side door] All right, Eric. Are you all set to go?"
3255,10,13,Cartman,[turns around] Go... Right... Where am I going? [he was facing a panel of UAL and UAA members]
3256,10,13,UAA Leader,[joins Shvek from the left side] W-we told you: we're sending you home. With the Crank and Wank Time Machine.
3257,10,13,Blavius,"[joins them both from the right side] Don't worry, my son. When you return to your time you will merge with your other self. It's all very Zen."
3258,10,13,Cartman,Wait... Isn't... everybody at war over atheism?
3259,10,13,Shvek and the UAL,Atheism? No. We've learned to get rid of all the isms in our time.
3260,10,13,Medic,"Yes. Long ago we realized isms are great for those who are rational, but in the hands of irrational people, isms always lead to violence."
3261,10,13,Cartman,So there is no war now in the future.
3262,10,13,Blavius,Of course there's war. The stupid French-Chinese think they have a right to Hawaii.
3263,10,13,All,Yeah!
3264,10,13,UAA Leader,"But now the moment has come to send you back to your time. [some rings descend from above and a blue light appears, indicating that beaming is about to begin]"
3265,10,13,Shvek and the UAL,"We unfroze you for a purpose, and now that purpose is fulfilled."
3266,10,13,Cartman,[wondering] And what was that purpose again?
3267,10,13,Shvek and the UAL,We explained that to you already.
3268,10,13,Cartman,Right... [a bird flies in and sets down next to him.]
3269,10,13,COCKA 3,"Goodbye, Eric. I will mess you. Squawk squawk"
3270,10,13,Cartman,"I'll miss you too, COCKA-3."
3271,10,13,UAA Leader,"So long, Eric. And tell everyone in the past for us, that no one single answer... is ever the answer. [the rings go back up and take Eric with them.]"
3272,10,13,Cartman,Noooo! [his future self is beamed into his body and he checks himself] I'm back. Wow! I'm back!
3273,10,13,Liane,"There you are, Eric."
3274,10,13,Cartman,"Mom! Mom, they did it!"
3275,10,13,Liane,"Eric, you have to come home. You can't just wait here for that game to come out."
3276,10,13,Cartman,"[happy, for once] No, I know. You're right, Mom. I need to learn to be patient. I think I can wait three weeks for Nintendo Wii to come out."
3277,10,13,Liane,"But, honey, it's only September. That... [points] Nintendo Wii doesn't come out for two months."
3278,10,13,Cartman,What? NO! [runs up to the window and sees that his mom is right] NOO!! [turns around and moves away from the storefront] You sent me back too far!! HEY! Do it over!
3279,10,13,Liane,"Who are you talking to, muffin?"
3280,10,13,Cartman,I can't wait two months! [runs back to the doors] I can't! There has to be a way around this!
3281,10,13,Clerk,"Hey, kid, somebody's on the phone for you."
3282,10,13,Cartman,Hello?
3283,10,13,Time Child,Hello? Hello? I know what you're thinking! Do not do it! You just need to be patient and wait the two months! Do you hear me?!
3284,10,13,Cartman,"...Oh, suck my balls, Kyle! [hangs up and leaves the store.]"
3285,10,14,Editor,[The nameplate on his desk says Mr. Jarvis] Being a delivery boy for the South Park Gazette is a noble privilege.
3286,10,14,Stan Marsh,"I'm sorry, Mr. Jarvis, it's just that... I have to get up at 4 a.m. to deliver your paper and then I go to school all day."
3287,10,14,Mr Jarvis,"Oh waaa waaa waaa! We've all got problems, pussy! Get used to it! [picks up today's paper] You aren't delivering the papers on time!"
3288,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[insistent] My bike had a busted pedal, but I got it fixed, so there won't be a problem anymore. [behind him, outside the window, a tow truck pulls up]"
3289,10,14,Mr Jarvis,[noticing] Is that your bike out there? [the driver leaves the cab and moves towards the back of the truck.]
3290,10,14,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Why?
3291,10,14,Mr Jarvis,'Cause it's being towed.
3292,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[turns around] What?? [walks to the door and looks out its window, then leaves the office while the driver locks the bike in place]"
3293,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Hey, hey! What are you doing?!"
3294,10,14,Tow Truck Driver,This your bike?
3295,10,14,Stan Marsh,Yes!
3296,10,14,Tow Truck Driver,"It's on the impound list. You owe the county for tickets. [the list shows the tow truck belonging to Jerry's Towing. The driver activates the crane, which slowly lifts one end of the bike up]"
3297,10,14,Stan Marsh,"No-dude, I need my bike to do my job!"
3298,10,14,Tow Truck Driver,Yeah? Well my job is to tow this bike. You want it back? You talk to the county. [gets back into the cab and closes the door]
3299,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[climbs up the door towards the driver] No NOO. Do NOT tow my bike! [the truck moves forward and Stan hops off. He moves towards the bike.] Stop, asshole! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! [catches up to the bike and grabs one of the pedals, but that just jerks him up and down a few times as the wheel on the ground moves the pedals. Stan hits the ground several times, getting bruised until he finally lets go of the pedal and rests on the street. He looks on helplessly as the truck keeps moving and his bike disappears in the distance]"
3300,10,14,Judge,Yes? Come in.
3301,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Hi, my name is Stan Marsh. I was told to come down here and try to-"
3302,10,14,Judge,"Yes! Come on, Mr. Marsh. I've been told all about your case. Impounded bicycle, $83 owed to the county. Maybe you should get a job."
3303,10,14,Stan Marsh,"I got a job, but without my bike to do my paper route, I can't make the money! See?"
3304,10,14,Judge,"[pulls out a pre-loaded record player and puts the needle onto the record, which begins playing, then says] Stan Marsh is a bright young man. He's got a great family, a promising paper route; only problem is, [removes the needle from the record] his bike's been impounded! [puts the needle back on the record, on another song] But now, he's about to find out that getting his bike back isn't so easy. [pulls the needle off again and puts the needle's arm in its resting place]"
3305,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[several seconds later] Look, I really need my bike."
3306,10,14,Judge,"[puts the record player aside] Well, I'm afraid I can't give it to you, because then you wouldn't learn anything.."
3307,10,14,Stan Marsh,What do I have to learn?! This isn't fair!
3308,10,14,Judge,"Whoa whoa, hold on. I've looked your case over and I think maybe we can cut a little deal here. According to your background check, when you were in kindergarten, you played on the Park County Pee Wee Hockey Team."
3309,10,14,Stan Marsh,...Yeah?
3310,10,14,Judge,Well it just so happens that the pee wee hockey team this year needs a coach.
3311,10,14,Stan Marsh,[apprehensive] Me?
3312,10,14,Judge,"[pulls out the record player again and plays it] Stan Marsh is a washed-up fourth grader. He's got no job, no bicycle. And his only way out is to coach... [pulls the needle off the record] a pee wee hockey team! [puts it on again] And now, he's about to find out that to coach, you've got to grow."
3313,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh boy. Uh, all right, guys, over here? Come over here. [the kids move towards him, tumbling. Stan decides to go in and meet them] We've got a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in."
3314,10,14,1,Who are you?
3315,10,14,Stan Marsh,My name is Stan and I'm your new coach. Now we just need to kind of organize a little bit and practice our-
3316,10,14,8,"Coach, I have to go potty."
3317,10,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, fine, go ahead."
3318,10,14,8,...By myself?
3319,10,14,Stan Marsh,"S- hold it a while, okay?"
3320,10,14,7,"What does ""passing"" mean?"
3321,10,14,Stan Marsh,When you shoot the puck to another player.
3322,10,14,15,[chubby boy] My mommy said I'm as big as the sky.
3323,10,14,3,"Coach, Wooden spit on my forehead!"
3324,10,14,6,I did not!
3325,10,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, all right, shut up! We're gonna practice! You two guys play defense, and you play goalie."
3326,10,14,13,"[downcast] I can't play goalie. [he's balk, save for a few hairs hanging down from inside his helmet]"
3327,10,14,Stan Marsh,Why not?!
3328,10,14,13,My doctor says I'm not supposed to.
3329,10,14,Stan Marsh,"What, you got asthma or something?"
3330,10,14,3,"No, he has cancer."
3331,10,14,Stan Marsh,[off guard] What?
3332,10,14,8,Nelson has leukemia. It's already spread to his bone marrow.
3333,10,14,13,I don't wanna have cancer! [covers his eyes and begins to weep]
3334,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Ah, it's okay. Don't cry."
3335,10,14,13,"But why me, coach? Why?"
3336,10,14,7,"Coach, why do people get cancer?"
3337,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[feeling overwhelmed] Oh Jesus, can we just practice?"
3338,10,14,1,"Are we gonna get cancer if we play with Nelson, Coach?"
3339,10,14,Stan Marsh,NO! [a rival team and its coach walk up to Park County]
3340,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach",Well well well! If it isn't the Park County Losers! [the rival players laugh. They're from Adams County]
3341,10,14,7,"Oh no! Adams County! [the Park County players back away, leaving Stan out front]"
3342,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","We just thought we'd come check out the ice for the game tomorrow. [steps forward and offers a handshake] Gavin Throttle, coach of the Adams County team."
3343,10,14,Stan Marsh,[steps forward to reply] Hey. [Coach Gavin withdraws his hand]
3344,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","Look, why don't you just give up? You can't beat us. You really want to embarrass your players?"
3345,10,14,7,Our coach isn't gonna let us lose!
3346,10,14,Park County Pee Wee Players,Yeah!!
3347,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","[steps forward again] Fine, if that's the way you want it. See ya tomorrow, coach! Adams Team!"
3348,10,14,Adams County Pee Wee Players,Right! Follow! [they leave the rink]
3349,10,14,6,"Coach, please don't let us lose to Adams County. My daddy will beat me again."
3350,10,14,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ. [his parents walk up to him]
3351,10,14,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, where have you been?! It's almost bedtime!"
3352,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Your mother's been worried sick, and I've been watching TV!"
3353,10,14,Stan Marsh,I got a new job. I'm finally gonna be able to pay off all the money I owe.
3354,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh, well that's good."
3355,10,14,Sharon Marsh,What kind of job?
3356,10,14,Stan Marsh,I'm working with the Pee Wee Hockey League.
3357,10,14,Randy Marsh,"...What? With the-? [turns around] What whoa wait, Stan. You gave up playing hockey a long time ago."
3358,10,14,Stan Marsh,"I'm not playing, I'm coaching."
3359,10,14,Randy Marsh,Have you forgotten what happened all those years ago? Or are you just trying to make up for it?
3360,10,14,Stan Marsh,[tense] What are you talking about?
3361,10,14,Randy Marsh,Your Pee Wee hockey game! The Pepsi Center?! In between periods of the Colorado Avalanche?
3362,10,14,Stan Marsh,[relaxes] I remember going to Shakey's afterwards.
3363,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Stan, you can't put your family through this again! Whatever your reasons are!"
3364,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[heads upstairs] I'm tired. I'm goin' to bed. [Randy moves towards him a bit, but Stan's door closes, and Randy turns to Sharon]"
3365,10,14,Randy Marsh,"What are we goin' to do, Sharon??"
3366,10,14,Sharon Marsh,What?
3367,10,14,Randy Marsh,Don't you get it? He's getting back into hockey to prove something to himself. So he can forget what happened in that Pee Wee skirmish.
3368,10,14,Sharon Marsh,Maybe he doesn't remember. He was only 4.
3369,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Oho, he remembers. I'm sure it eats at him every single day."
3370,10,14,Announcer,"And we're about out of time here in another scoreless Pee Wee hockey game. [a boy skates towards the camera] And that's # 7, Stan Marsh, skating towards the goal, sort of, but h doesn't have the puck. [players nowhere near him just fall randomly. Two players manage to move towards a puck. The South Park player falls onto the Denver player, who kicks the puck away]"
3371,10,14,Denver Goalie,"[farts, and realizes he did more than that] I crapped 'em! Oh me I crapped 'em! [leaves the goal defenseless]"
3372,10,14,Announcer,"Oh, it appears the goalie has pooped his pants. [the pucks moves towards Stan and stops right in front of him. The spotlight lands on him. The announcer stands] Oh and look at this! Little Stan Marsh actually has a shot at the goal!"
3373,10,14,Crowd,Ohhhh!
3374,10,14,Randy Marsh,[with longer hair] Stan?? Shoot it! [Stan isn't sure what to do]
3375,10,14,Announcer,Time is running out. Stan Marsh with a chance to win!
3376,10,14,Kyle Broflovski,"You got it, Stan!"
3377,10,14,Randy Marsh,"[quite animated. Sharon holds him down] Take the shot!! Take the shot!! [Stan takes the shot and the puck moves towards the goal, but stops just inches from success. The buzzer sounds and no one wins] NOOOOOOOOOOO!"
3378,10,14,Announcer,"Ohoooo, that's the end of the game! How disappointing. [Stan looks around, scared.]"
3379,10,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, what's wrong??"
3380,10,14,Randy Marsh,"OH! Ohh... Oh Sharon, it was horrible! It was like I was living it all over again."
3381,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[blows his whistle] All right, guys. Tonight is our big game against Adams County. We still have all day to practice."
3382,10,14,A Man,"Coach? Hey coach. [the man and his wife appear] Could we talk to you, please? [Stan leaves the rink to meet them]"
3383,10,14,Woman,We are the Browns. Nelson's parents?
3384,10,14,Stan Marsh,Oh
3385,10,14,Mr Brown,"Our little Nelson, he's... taken a turn for the worse, I'm afraid! His cancer is... real ba-a-a-ad. [Mrs. Brown tries to soothe him, but begins to weep softly]"
3386,10,14,Stan Marsh,Ohhh.
3387,10,14,Mr Brown,"Yeah. Oh. Doctors say this could be it. How am I supposed to do it, coach? How do I look a five year old child in the eye and tell him he's not gonna live? [frustration leads to anger] You tell me, coach! You tell me how!!"
3388,10,14,Mrs Brown,"Stop it, Jack! He doesn't mean to take it out on you, coach."
3389,10,14,Mr Brown,"[frustrated again] No, I don't mean to take it out on you, coach. It's just... [fiddling with his had nervously] I don't know what to say to him, coach. Neither of us do. What do you say tuh... somebody who's dying, huh?"
3390,10,14,Stan Marsh,... I don't know.
3391,10,14,Mr Brown,"Will you talk to him, coach? He looks up to you."
3392,10,14,Stan Marsh,"No, I think you oughta."
3393,10,14,Mr Brown,"Nah, I'm just his father. But you're his coach! You're like a father to him."
3394,10,14,Mrs Brown,"Please, coach, he's... [turns aside to cry] he's counting on you!"
3395,10,14,Mr Brown,"[bows several times] Please, coach, he's counting on you!"
3396,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[enters the room] Oh uh, hey Nelson."
3397,10,14,Nelson Brown,"Oh. [coughs] Hi, coach."
3398,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I can come back later. Is this a bad time for you?"
3399,10,14,Nelson Brown,"Yeah, it's a pretty bad time for me, coach. I'm only five and I'm dying. [Stan walks up to him] Coach, what's it like when you die?"
3400,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Wugh, I'm not sure. I would... think that... it's a lot like it was before you were born?"
3401,10,14,Nelson Brown,How come I have to die now?
3402,10,14,Stan Marsh,Ogh.
3403,10,14,Nelson Brown,"I mean, how come I don't get to grow up?"
3404,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Goddammit, dude, I don't know."
3405,10,14,Nelson Brown,I'm sorry.
3406,10,14,Stan Marsh,"No, what I mean is, nobody really knows, see? But everyone does it. I mean, it's not like everyone else gets to live and only you have to die. Everyone's gonna die. You feel better now?"
3407,10,14,Nelson Brown,I think so.
3408,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay, great. Look, I, I gotta get to the stadium, but uh... hang in there? All right? [gives him a thumbs up and walks away]"
3409,10,14,Nelson Brown,"Thanks, coach. [Stan is close to the door...] Will you do me just one favor, Coach? That game tonight? I'm gonna be watching, so... could you... make it so I don't have cancer?"
3410,10,14,Stan Marsh,"No- dude, I told you I can't do that."
3411,10,14,Nelson Brown,"Well then, will you just... win for me?"
3412,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay. [pause. He steps out of the room and closes the door. Behind the door is the judge, waiting. He has his record player with him. He starts playing it...]"
3413,10,14,Judge,"Stan Marsh has always lived a carefree life. But in the blink of an eye, what seemed important before can all be put in perspective. Stan Marsh is... ""Bummin' on Cancer."" [takes the needle off, and Stan walks away.]"
3414,10,14,Announcer,"Welcome, parents, to this Pee Wee hockey match between Park County and Adams County. [Sharon walks in and sits down]"
3415,10,14,Adams County Pee Wee Players,[Gavin leads them in the cheer] Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win!
3416,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Gavin] Coach, can I talk to you for a second?"
3417,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","Come to surrender, coach?"
3418,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[takes him aside] Look, there's a kid in my team who's got cancer, and, he wants us to win this game really bad, so, could you just... give us kind of a break?"
3419,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","HA! I don't think so, Coach. We're gonna beat you into the ground, cancer or no! [turns and heads back to his team] Win! Win! Win! Win!"
3420,10,14,Adams County Pee Wee Players,Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! Win! ...
3421,10,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, guys, listen. [turns around] I saw Nelson in the hospital, and he asked me one thing: he said he wanted us to win this game... for him. [the players look at each other]"
3422,10,14,6,"Sooo, if we lose we're gonna kill Nelson?"
3423,10,14,7,"Oh Jesus, no!"
3424,10,14,3,I don't wanna be a murderer!
3425,10,14,Stan Marsh,Relax! If we lose we're not gonna be murderers.
3426,10,14,7,If we lose are we gonna get cancer?
3427,10,14,13,Oh no!
3428,10,14,15,Ohhh..
3429,10,14,8,Oh no.
3430,10,14,6,I don't want cancer.
3431,10,14,7,"They look pretty strong, coach. I think Nelson's gonna die for sure. [Stan looks a bit awed at the kid's assessment. The referee skates up to the center of the rink. Blur's ""Song No. 2"" begins to play.]"
3432,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","Good luck, Coach! You're gonna need it! [the ref throws down the puck and the skaters move... and fall over] Yeah! Let's go Adams!"
3433,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Let's go, Park! Come on!"
3434,10,14,"Gavin Throttle, Adams County Coach","That's it, Brian! Kill him! [motions to Stan, then returns to watching the game]"
3435,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Get near the puck! [Park County players fall. No one is getting near the puck. No. 15, the goalie, continues picking his nose. Fast forward to the end of the third period. An Adams County player is struggling to keep his bladder in check. One second left in the game]"
3436,10,14,Announcer,And that's the end of the game. The result is a tie.
3437,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Tie? Well, what does that mean?"
3438,10,14,Judge,"[walks up with his record player and plays it] Stan Marsh was supposed to win it all. The big game. A dying boy's hope. Only problem is, [pulls the needle off the record.] he tied! [puts the needle on another track] And now, he's about to find out that tying isn't the same as winning. [pulls the needle up]"
3439,10,14,1,So did we kill Nelson or not?
3440,10,14,Stan Marsh,Hello?
3441,10,14,Nelson Brown,Coach.
3442,10,14,Stan Marsh,How are you feeling?
3443,10,14,Nelson Brown,"I feel pretty good, except for the cancer. [coughs] Coach? Does God hate me?"
3444,10,14,Dr Doctor,"Oh, hello Coach."
3445,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Uh, hi Doc. How's he doing?"
3446,10,14,Dr Doctor,"Well, he isn't worse, but, he isn't getting better. It's almost as if... his cancer were tied."
3447,10,14,Stan Marsh,Oh boy.
3448,10,14,Nelson Brown,[coughs] Oh. My cancer hurts.
3449,10,14,Dr Doctor,"He seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game. And with a tie, he's in a kind of... cancer limbo."
3450,10,14,Stan Marsh,But what can I do?
3451,10,14,Judge,[rushes into the room with his record player] Stan Marsh! Stan Marsh! Great news! Our hockey team has just been invited to play against Denver County during a Colorado Avalanche game!
3452,10,14,Nelson Brown,Wow. [smiles] At the Pepsi Center?
3453,10,14,Dr Doctor,Look! He's coming around again.
3454,10,14,Nelson Brown,"That's our biggest game ever. Do you think we can win, Coach?"
3455,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Well, ah, I mean..."
3456,10,14,Judge,"[sets the record player on the floor and plays it] Imagine. If there was one game, one chance, to make everything right. Stan Marsh is being given that chance. But to win, he's gonna have to pull out all the stops in... ""Stanley's Cup""! Rated R. [turns the player off]"
3457,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah... yeah, we'll beat 'em."
3458,10,14,Nelson Brown,All right! Maybe there IS hope for me.
3459,10,14,Dr Doctor,"[takes Stan aside] Just be aware of this, Coach. If you lose the Big Game, that little boy is going to die faster than Steve Irwin in a tank full of stingrays."
3460,10,14,6,Coach! What the hell were you thinking?
3461,10,14,3,We can't beat Denver County.
3462,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Well, sure we can."
3463,10,14,6,Last time we played Denver they scored seven times.
3464,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Look, guys. I believe in you. Nelson believes in you. Doesn't that count for anything?"
3465,10,14,8,"No, 'cause they're gonna kill us."
3466,10,14,Stan Marsh,They're not gonna kill us.
3467,10,14,6,That's what Steve Irwin said about those stingrays.
3468,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[thinks a bit] Haven't you guys ever seen these movies? We're just supposed to rally together, believe in ourselves, and we win in the end."
3469,10,14,3,"No. In the movies, they always go out and find a kid who's really good to join the team."
3470,10,14,Stan Marsh,Hey that's right. We need a ringer. [smiles]
3471,10,14,13,We need a Canadian. [Next thing you see is Ike shooting pucks into the goal. Stan and Kyle watch. Stan smiles.]
3472,10,14,6,"Wow, he's good."
3473,10,14,Park County Pee Wee Players,Yeah!
3474,10,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, I told you. My mom doesn't want Ike playing hockey. She thinks it's dangerous."
3475,10,14,Stan Marsh,"It's just for one game. He won't get hurt, I promise. [Ike is wearing #2]"
3476,10,14,Park County Pee Wee Players,Yeah!
3477,10,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, but it's gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions, Stan. You'd better have a really good game plan."
3478,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Can you believe it, Stan? The Pepsi Center. You're going back to the place where it all happened. Same place where you missed that shot all those years ago."
3479,10,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, I'm working on my game plan right now."
3480,10,14,Randy Marsh,"Ya have to understand why I can't go. I can't... sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again. [sits at the foot of the bed] Oh, Stan. Of all the places, why does it have to be the Pepsi Center? All right, all right, I'll go. No, no I WANT to go. [gets up and looks at Stan] I'm gonna be there for you and... I'll be rooting louder than anybody, saying ""That's my son!"" [turns around and leaves the room, then turns around again] And just remember, Stan: win or lose. Those are your two options, Win, or lose. [turns left and walks away]"
3481,10,14,Announcer,"His shot is blocked! What a great save! [a man holds up a banner that reads ""GO AVS."" The buzzer sounds and the score is tied at 2-2 at the end of the second period] And that's the end of the second period. The score is tied 2-all. [the teams go to their locker rooms] And now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our state's finest Pee Wee hockey players."
3482,10,14,Stan Marsh,"[at an entrance with his team] All right, you guys, this is it. The moment is here. We've been through a lot together, and according to every movie ever made, we're going to win this game. Just don't forget: there's a little boy in the hospital who's really counting on us. So let's not let him down. Are you with me?! [all the players are with him in their own ways.] All right, let's go win!"
3483,10,14,NHL Official,"[rounds the corner and spots them] Sorry boys, you aren't playing tonight."
3484,10,14,Stan Marsh,Huh?
3485,10,14,NHL Official,The other Pee Wee hockey team didn't show up. There's nobody for you to play. Thanks for makin' the trip though.
3486,10,14,Park County Pee Wee Players,We came to play.
3487,10,14,Stan Marsh,Sso then we win?
3488,10,14,NHL Official,No. Nobody wins.
