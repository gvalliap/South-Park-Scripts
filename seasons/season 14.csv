0,14,1,Man,"Put it down, you bitch!"
1,14,1,Man,"Put the golf club down, you crazy bitch! [it's Tiger Woods, cowering behind a chair]"
2,14,1,Woman,"[smashes some more dishes] You motherfucker! I never should have married you! [Elin, with a bad Swedish accent]"
3,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"You're overreacting, you stupid Swedish cow!"
4,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,Then why-a the fuck are you getting a text-a message from some-a low-life-a hooker on Thanksgiving?!
5,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"God, shut up! [runs out of the dining room] Shut! Up! [enters his den and starts rummaging through a drawer] Where are my fucking pills?! [finds them, takes a bunch, and swallows them]"
6,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"Oh yeah! Take more vitamins, Tiger! That'll help!!"
7,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,Will you just listen to me?!
8,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"Listen to this-a! [runs up to him and whacks him across the face as he turns to face her, leaving a bleeding gash across his right cheek]"
9,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,[winces] Aaaah! [looks at her] You fucking whore!
10,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,Oh where the fuck do ya think-a you're going?!
11,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"I'm getting the fuck away from you! [opens the drivers' side door and gets in the SUV. Elin approaches that door with the club. Tiger starts the engine, and Elin starts swinging at the left rear door]"
12,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"Open the door, you motherfucker! [Tiger peels away]"
13,14,1,Eric Cartman,"[playing as Tiger] Ooo yeah, take that from me in the car, Kenny! [Stan and Kyle walk into the store and spot the other two boys]"
14,14,1,Stan Marsh,What are you guys doing?
15,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, check it out! It's EA Sports Tiger Woods PGA Tour '11 for Xbox. [onscreen, Elin is chasing the SUV and leaving cracks in the rear windows with each swing of the club]"
16,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"D'Aaaah! Fuck you, cunt!"
17,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Stop breaking through the window, Kenny! Whoa, I'm gonna crash I'm gonna crash! [Cartman loses control of the SUV, which hits a fire hydrant, then a tree. Elin catches up to the SUV as Tiger opens the door and staggers out, a bit dazed. The radiator is letting out steam]"
18,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"Aw, look what you did, you crazy bitch!"
19,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"It serves you right, you cheating turd! [swings at him and misses]"
20,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh dude, was that a combo move?"
21,14,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah dude, I fucked you up.)"
22,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, here come the cops! We've gotta lie to them. Hit X to lie."
23,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, I didn't know golf games were this cool."
24,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Yeah dude, EA Sports outdid themselves this time."
25,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"I've gathered you together here because you are the best minds our country has to offer. As you've all seen on the news, our country is facing a major crisis, and we need to find out what's causing it. [the men glance at each other] Why? Why are rich successful men suddenly going out and trying to have sex with lots of women?"
26,14,1,Expert 1,"[with mustache and black coat] Tiger Woods was only the most prevalent, but our data shows that the numbers are growing. David Letterman and before that, Bill Clinton. There's a pattern here, people."
27,14,1,Expert 2,"[with mustache and midnight blue coat] Why would a man who's famous and makes tons of money use that and have sex with lots of different women? [glances at the woman to his left, then looks ahead again]"
28,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"[stands up] Aand these rich celebrities have perfectly good wives at home. Why would they even think of sex with others? Dammit! [pounds the table with his right fist, but manages only a soft blow] I want answers!"
29,14,1,Expert 3,"[balding, with lab coat] We believe that it may be an outbreak of sex addiction, sir."
30,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,[sits down] Sex awhowho?
31,14,1,Expert 4,"[glasses and lab coat] It's a new phenomena we don't completely understand yet, but it... seems to make people... different. Of course, we all know the normal healthy male thinks only of sex occasionally and has no desire for sex with multiple partners. [the other men murmur in agreement]"
32,14,1,Expert 5,Definitely true.
33,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"Yes, we all know that, go on."
34,14,1,Expert 4,"But in the sex addict, their entire lives are consumed with thoughts of wanting more and more. The mere sight of an attractive woman could... can make them think about sex with her."
35,14,1,Expert 6,[with fat cheeks] But what about love? How could tons of fame and money make you forget about love? [looks at the woman to his right]
36,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,What could be causing this outbreak of sexual addiction?
37,14,1,Expert 7,"[black] It could be caused by something in the water supply. Uh, perhaps even by - global warming."
38,14,1,Expert 8,[Japanese ancestry] Or cooling.
39,14,1,Expert 9,Yes
40,14,1,Expert 7,"If.so, then the disease could start to affect our children"
41,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,That does it! [pounds the table softly] I want health screening at all our nation's schools! We need to find out if any young people might be carrying this disease.
42,14,1,Expert 9,"Good afternoon, students. We are going to be a doing a health screening today. It won't take long, it'll be relatively painless, but we need to see if any students are showing... symptoms. [to his left is a cart with two beakers, a tray, and a picture resting against the legs] I'n a moment, I'm going to show you a suggestive picture. [puts the tray on the middle shelf of the cart and picks up the picture] And then I'm going to ask you a question about that picture. Alright, ready? Here we go. [turns the picture around and a naked couple appears, caressing. The class gasps]"
43,14,1,The class,Oh! Wow. Ohhh.
44,14,1,Kenny McCormick,[cheering] (Woo hoo!)
45,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Jesus, dude."
46,14,1,Butters Stotch,"Holy moly, what's that between the lady's legs? It's all bushy."
47,14,1,Expert 9,"Please just study the picture the best you can, students. I'll then ask you the question which you'll answer on the paper provided."
48,14,1,Butters Stotch,[pointing] I've never seen that part of a lady! Do they all got a hedge like that? Do they??
49,14,1,Expert 9,"Okay, very good. [sets the picture down against the cart again] Now, what color... was the handkerchief in the nice lady's hand? Write down your answer, please: what color was the handkerchief... in the nice lady's hand?"
50,14,1,Butters Stotch,[to Clyde] Did you see that bush on that lady?? What the heck was that??
51,14,1,Expert 9,"Very good, turn your answers over please. [the students turn their sheets over]"
52,14,1,Butters Stotch,"Gee whiz, it was like almost up to her belly button!"
53,14,1,Expert 9,"Alright, now, who answered that the handkerchief was... yellow? [most of the kids raise their hands] Very good, very good indeed. Now I'd like to see who answered ""What handkerchief?"" [Kenny is the first to raise his hand. Kyle is nervous and looks around, but then raises his left hand. Butters looks over at them and then raises his left hand] A-ha! You three boys, please come with me. [heads for the door as Kyle, Kenny, and Butters leave their seats]"
54,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"I didn't see a handkerchief. Did you see a handkerchief, Kenny?"
55,14,1,Kenny McCormick,"(Fuck no, I wasn't looking at a handkerchief!)"
56,14,1,Expert 9,"I'm sorry boys, but I'm afraid you three have tested positive for sex addiction."
57,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
58,14,1,Butters Stotch,Oh no!
59,14,1,Kenny McCormick,[annoyed] (Who fuckin' cares?)
60,14,1,Expert 9,"We're gonna have to send you home, I'm afraid."
61,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Wait, we're sex addicts? Uh-are you sure?"
62,14,1,Expert 9,"Our nice-lady-with-the-handkerchief test is extremely comprehensive and thorough. I'm sorry, but you're simply too dangerous to have around normal, well-adjusted students."
63,14,1,Butters Stotch,It was just... so big and bushy sir. Why does it look like that?
64,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,So what happens to us now?
65,14,1,Expert 9,"[sighs and rises from his chair, walking off] A life of desperation and anguish, I'm afraid. Your addiction will start off slowly - magazines, Internet sites - but then, as you keep chasing your high your tastes will get more and more dangerous. Most likely you'll end up going the way of David Carradine and Michael Hutchence: autoerotic asphyxiation."
66,14,1,Kenny McCormick,(Autoerotic asphyxiation? What's that?)
67,14,1,Expert 9,"I don't want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome."
68,14,1,Kenny McCormick,(Really??)
69,14,1,Butters Stotch,Oh no. I don't wanna have to buy a Batman costume.
70,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"Ladies and gentlemen, for the past several days we've been screening our nation's schools for signs of sex addiction. The results of our tests are troubling to say the least. Dr. Tonton?"
71,14,1,Dr Tonton,"[expert 9, as it turns out. He heads to a chart] In fourth graders, five percent of male students were found to be sex addicts. By sixth grade the number goes up to thirty percent. At high schools, nearly ninety-one percent of male students answered, ""What handkerchief?"""
72,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"We're facing a sex addiction epidemic in our country. Young people all over America are infected, and at extreme risk to themselves and to the people around them. [Kyle watches this on TV from his bed] They're leading lives of secret pain."
73,14,1,Reporter 1,And so these infected boys will soon be secretly wishing they could be having sex all the time with lots of different people?
74,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,It appears so.
75,14,1,Reporter 1,The poor bastards!
76,14,1,Reporter 2,But what about us normal healthy adults? Are we at risk of exposure?
77,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"We don't believe so. In adult males, for whatever reason, sex addiction only seems to be problematic amongst rich successful celebrities. [Randy watches this on TV from bed. Sharon is beside him reading a book instead] However, we are still collecting data, and all-"
78,14,1,Randy Marsh,Why would wealth and success cause a man to go out and have sex with everyone he could?
79,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"-answers which we all desire. [next scene is the McCormick living room] Whatever is causing this outbreak, we guarantee we will find it! [Mrs. McCormick comes out with a pizza]"
80,14,1,Mrs McCormick,"Kenny, it's time for dinner! [goes upstairs to Kenny's room and looks inside] Kenny? [turns around and gasps. Kenny had hanged himself from his closet door with a belt while dressed in a Batman suit and masturbating to a magazine. His left hand is tucked inside the tights, around the genitals] AAAA!"
81,14,1,Priest,"Sunset and Evening Star, and one clear call for me, and may their be no moaning of the bar when I put out to sea."
82,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, it's true."
83,14,1,Priest,"But such a tide as moving seems asleep, too full for sound and foam, when that which drew from out the boundless deep t-"
84,14,1,Butters Stotch,"There! It was like that! It looked just like that! [stands on his chair and points to a bush, then walks over to it] Just like this, buh, but smaller, and right in the place where her underwear should've been. If I trim it down, it'll look right.."
85,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[reaching him] Butters! Butters, stop it!"
86,14,1,Butters Stotch,[fights Kyle off] But this is what I keep seeing in my head!
87,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"[pulls him away from the bush] Butters, we are sick! Don't you get it?! We're gonna end up just like Kenny!"
88,14,1,Butters Stotch,"[fights Kyle off again] No, uh, if I can just see it again, I, I'll be fine."
89,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"No! Butters, stop! [slaps him]"
90,14,1,Butters Stotch,Haah! Leave me alone! [reaches for the bush again]
91,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Stop it! Stop! [pulls him back and flings him to the ground. They fight for a few seconds, then break down and cry out] Oh God! Oh God, help us!"
92,14,1,Commentator,Tiger... lines up his drive. He'll be hoping for a birdie here. Concentration is key.
93,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,[runs into the scene from screen right with her own golf club] You motherfucker! I never should have married you! [starts hitting him with it]
94,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"Aaagh! Goddamnit, stop it! [blocks her club with his, as in a sword fight, and now they trade blows]"
95,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,How many women did you fuck-a?! How many?!
96,14,1,Stan Marsh,"Aw dude, I clocked you!"
97,14,1,Eric Cartman,"I told you this game was sweet, dude."
98,14,1,Stan Marsh,"Hang on, hang on, I'm switching to a 7-iron. [Elin gets a new club and her swings get faster]"
99,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh! O-oh! Oh man, I lost another endorsement! How'd you do that?"
100,14,1,Stan Marsh,Hit A and X together.
101,14,1,Announcer,Round 2. Fight!! [Tiger and Elin face off again and start swinging]
102,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you're going down, Elin!"
103,14,1,Stan Marsh,"I don't think so dude, I got the pre-nup power-up."
104,14,1,Announcer,Pre-nup power-up. [a pre-nuptial agreement appears onscreen and then flies off. Elin swings and Tiger a few more times and he's on the grass on his back]
105,14,1,Eric Cartman,Oh no! [Elin continues beating up Tiger] Pre-nup? Weak. When'd you get that power-up?
106,14,1,Therapist,"All right, sex addicts. What other destructive behaviors that we engaged in that led to our ultimate downfall? [on the dry-erase board are three examples: ""Sex Shop Visits, Sex With Hookers, Going To Strip Clubs""] Anyone have another example? Let's see, how about... David!"
107,14,1,David Letterman,"Haha, Oh, ahh, having sex with employees."
108,14,1,Therapist,"[writing on the board] ""Sex with employees."" Definitely a danger there. What else? Uh, Mr. Clinton."
109,14,1,Bill Clinton,Putting cigars in girls' vaginas?
110,14,1,Therapist,"Very good, Billy. [writing on the board] ""cigars in vaginas."" Not the best idea there."
111,14,1,Charlie Sheen,Watching Internet porn all day every day?
112,14,1,Therapist,"Spot on, Charlie Sheen! Excessive [writing on the board] ""Internet porn."" Now, the reason we are making this list is that we have new members today. I want you all to welcome Kyle and Bummers. The men all turn to look at the boys, who are seated in the last row."
113,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,Hello?
114,14,1,The men,"Hey Kyle, hi Kyle."
115,14,1,Therapist,"And would you care to share your stories with us, boys?"
116,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I just found out I'm a sex addict. I'm so scared, I haven't even told my mom yet."
117,14,1,Bill Clinton,Does your mom have big tits?
118,14,1,Therapist,Billy!
119,14,1,Bill Clinton,[sheepishly] Sorry...
120,14,1,Butters Stotch,"Me, I just... Well I just can't stop thinking about bush."
121,14,1,Ben Roethlisberger,I heard that.
122,14,1,Butters Stotch,"I mean it's like, what is it? What does it mean? Why would there be a bush right there? Is it a live bush? Are there berries?"
123,14,1,Therapist,"Mr. Duchovny, please stop jerking off!"
124,14,1,David Duchovny,"[stops] Aw, gee whiz!"
125,14,1,Expert 4,"To better understand the sex addiction outbreak, we've been running tests on chimpanzees. [an enclosure full of chimps is shown] You can see that this entire community of specimens are getting along normally, some pairing off, others on their own, but now see this chimp here. [a chimp is shown sitting peacefully scratching himself here and there] An average adult normal male blending in seamlessly with the others. Now watch. We're going to give it a lot of money. [presses a button and speaks into a mic] Go ahead. [two researchers walk into the enclosure and dump lots of dollar bills on the peaceful chimp and walk out. The chimp looks at the money and starts getting excited. He stands up and grins widely, then walks around with dollars bills in his hands. He walks up to a chimp with a baby chimp in her hands and bangs her from behind. She lets the baby go. The male chimp moves on to the next female and bangs her face to face, then he moves to the third female and bangs her from behind. ]"
126,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,My God...
127,14,1,Expert 4,"Yes... [the chimp goes on to bang two other females and an angry chimp is heard in the background. She comes out in curlers, robe, and slippers, and wields a rolling pin. She approaches the male chimp and beats him up with the rolling pin, then walks away as he writhes on the ground. The other chimps hoot and holler, and one of them throws feces at him] The subject is now isolated and shunned."
128,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"Incredible. And, and what's it doing now?"
129,14,1,Expert 4,Making a public apology on its talk show. [and so it is]
130,14,1,Therapist,"Alrighty. Now, we all know the destructive behaviors that got us into this predicament, don't we? What is the main thing we've all learned to avoid? [Tiger raises his hand] Yes, Tiger?"
131,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,Avoid drugs? And alcohol?
132,14,1,The other men,Auugh!
133,14,1,Therapist,"No, no, Tiger, you still aren't getting it. [Kyle has a memo pad and pen, Butters is trimming a small bonsai tree] In order to make sure we are no longer destroying our lives with any of these behaviors, we must avoid... anyone? Avoid getting... anyone?"
134,14,1,Michael Douglas,Caught.
135,14,1,Therapist,"Yes, Michael Douglas! Everyone!"
136,14,1,The Men,Getting caught.
137,14,1,Therapist,"Very good! You are all here in therapy [draws a big circle around the destructive behaviors and writes ""CAUGHT"" over them] because you got caught! So how do we avoid getting caught? Ben Rothlisberger?"
138,14,1,Ben Rothlisberger,Don't screw girls in the public bathrooms?
139,14,1,David Letterman,"When they uh ask you for money, pay them."
140,14,1,Therapist,"Good, yes!"
141,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, hang on! We shouldn't be learning how not to get caught. We have to take responsibility for our actions. [Butters stops trimming the tree, the men all look at Kyle]"
142,14,1,Bill Clinton,[breaks the silence] What the fuck are you talkin' about?
143,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, ah I mean, we have to accept that we have a problem, and put the blame completely on ourselves. I mean, maybe this isn't really even a disease. [the therapist turns around and walks away from the group, then places a call]"
144,14,1,Therapist,"Yeah, it's me. We've got a turd in the punch bowl. I repeat, we have a turd in the punch bowl."
145,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"Mr. President, in every test the results were the same. The monkeys who were given cash always acted out their sexual addiction to dangerous levels. It appears that money has a direct effect on the virus's ability to develop."
146,14,1,President Barack Obama,So we must keep our nation's youth away from money and success.
147,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"No good, Mr. President. Because we've learned that sex addicts will find ways to make money and become successful in order to feed their addiction."
148,14,1,President Barack Obama,You mean boys will start working towards being rich and successful just so they can one day have sex with lots of women??
149,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"Yes. That's why we decided to look at the cash itself for clues! We tried to find something in the hundred dollar bill that could explain why this is happening now. Then we looked at the backside, and found this. [points to the picture of Independence Hall on the back of the bill] Independence Hall."
150,14,1,President Barack Obama,The birthplace of our country.
151,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,We believe something is happening in Independence Hall that gives money its power over men.
152,14,1,President Barack Obama,"Independence Hall... Independence Day... Aliens... Gentlemen, I might know what's causing the sex addiction outbreak. This is highly classified, but... in 1947 a flying saucer was discovered in Roswell, New Mexico. Two deceased alien bodies were recovered and hidden from public knowledge. They carried... a virus with them. A virus that only barely stopped from spreading all over the country."
153,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,And you think that these aliens... could be back with a new virus? One originating from Independence Hall causing rich successful men to have sex with lots of women?!
154,14,1,President Barack Obama,"[seriously] It's the only explanation that makes any sense. [glances at Michelle, who doesn't react, then looks at the chairman again]"
155,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,I want to say that I am deeply sorry for my irresponsible and selfish behavior. I know that I have severely disappointed all of you. Some have speculated that my wife somehow hurt or attacked me on Thanksgiving Night. It angers me that people would fabricate a story like that. She has shown nothing but grace and poise-
156,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,[off-stage] You motherfucker!
157,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,Oh no!
158,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,I should have never married [jumps out from behind the curtain and whacks him with a golf club] youuu! [continues whacking him]
159,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,Agh! Stop it!
160,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,A porn star?! You screwed a porn star?! [the camera pulls back to reveal the video game the boys were playing earlier]
161,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, you found another girl's phone number on my cell phone??"
162,14,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, back in that water level. [looks over at the front door, then back at the game] Is Kyle still at sex-addiction therapy? That must be really intense."
163,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay so, what exactly are we doing now?"
164,14,1,Therapist,[sighs heavily] We are on our way to help take of your diseases once and for all!
165,14,1,Butters Stotch,"Oh good, 'cause I really can't take it anymore."
166,14,1,Therapist,"Don't worry, as soon as it's dead everything will make sense."
167,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,...As soon as what's dead? [the men groan]
168,14,1,Therapist,The infected alien that they just discovered is hiding out at Independence Hall!
169,14,1,SWAT Officer 1,"Entrance is clear, Mr. President. [Obama leads the chairman and other CDD officials into the front room of the building]"
170,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"Mr. President, you aren't safe here. Let us handle this."
171,14,1,SWAT Officer 2,Right side clear!
172,14,1,Expert 4,We must be careful. The alien could have cast some kind of spell of invisibility.
173,14,1,President Barack Obama,[softly] Which would mean that the alien is also a wizard.
174,14,1,Expert 1,"Yes! It explains everything! A wizard alien would be able to cast a spell on our species, causing all the men to become sex addicts."
175,14,1,President Barack Obama,Enough! We need to find the wizard alien and break his spell.
176,14,1,SWAT Officer 2,"[chuckles] Okay okay alright alright, hang, hang on guys. I mean, come on, this is getting a little ridiculous. Wizard aliens? We all know what's going on here, don't we? Whenever a story breaks about some rich famous guy going around and having sex with tons of girls, we all wanna act like we don't understand it, but we do. We're guys, you know? Our brains are wired to strive to be the alpha male and get all the women we can. [walks into an open area in the room] I mean, look where we are. Even, even Benjamin Franklin screwed everything that moved. Because he could. We don't have to condone what these rich, famous people do, but... we can at least admit that, given the same temptations and opportunities that somebody like Tiger Woods has, a lot of us guys might do somethin' similar. [Obama thinks this over...]"
177,14,1,President Barack Obama,[speaks into a mic strapped to his wrist] We have a turd in the punch bowl.
178,14,1,Secret Service Agent,Turd in the punch bowl. [the other SWAT members close in on him]
179,14,1,SWAT Officer 2,"Hey, what are you doin- No. No, come on. [and take him away] Where are you takin' me?"
180,14,1,News 4 Reporter,"Ten city blocks have been shut down because an alien is believed to have taken refuge here in Independence Hall. By all accounts, the alien is also a wizard, who could very easily be the cause of the outbreak of sex addiction in our country. [everyone in the Hall is moving around cautiously, with flashlights on.]"
181,14,1,SWAT Officer 3,"[voice only] Mr. President, here they are. [all flashlights point towards the source of the voice. The SWAT officers make way for the therapist, Kyle, and Butters]"
182,14,1,Therapist,"This is the boy I told you about. And his friend, Bummers."
183,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"Son, we were told that you think sex addiction can be controlled. That it just takes restraint. Is that true?"
184,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,I just think I'd rather... control it instead of blame it on anything.
185,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,A-mazing. Then the wizard alien spell might not have any power over him! He could draw the bastard out!
186,14,1,President Barack Obama,"Quick, give that boy a gun! [a SWAT officer gives him a rifle]"
187,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,What?
188,14,1,SWAT Officer 3,You'd better take one too. [gives Butters a rifle]
189,14,1,President Barack Obama,"Alright, everyone to the stairwell. The bastard's gotta be upstairs. [moves towards the stairs as well]"
190,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,What bastard?
191,14,1,President Barack Obama,"[looks back at Kyle] The alien wizard hiding out here! Come on, we've got tuh- [a muffled voice is heard]"
192,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,[on the stairs] The hell was that?
193,14,1,SWAT Officer 4,"I got a baaad feelin' about this. [behind Kyle and Butters, a door opens and the kidnapped SWAT officer stumbles out with his hands tied in front of him and holding a wand, wearing a huge green mascot head of an alien with ogre ears, a white beard, and a wizard's hat.]"
194,14,1,Dr Tonton,Oh my God there it is!
195,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"It's the alien wizard! It's gonna get you boys! Shoot it! [a strobe light flickers on and off, blinding the bound SWAT officer, who stumbles around trying to free himself]"
196,14,1,President Barack Obama,Shoot it boys!
197,14,1,Expert 6,You have to shoot it! [Kyle fires a shot]
198,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"Shoot it again, it's still alive! [Butters fires a shot]"
199,14,1,SWAT Officer 5,You gotta reload! [the boys reload slowly]
200,14,1,Expert 4,"Keep firing, boys! Shoot it in the heart! [Kyle fires a shot]"
201,14,1,President Barack Obama,Keep shooting it!
202,14,1,Expert 11,"Shoot him in his blabber mouth! [Kyle fires again, then Butters fires a shot, and the SWAT officer falls to the floor dead. The strobe light keeps flashing just in case]"
203,14,1,CDC Chairman and Experts,"My God, they've done it!"
204,14,1,Bill Clinton,Look! The sex addiction! It's leavin' my body!
205,14,1,David Letterman,I can feel it! I'm free!
206,14,1,Another addict,We are healed!
207,14,1,President Barack Obama,"We watched... as sex addiction ran rampant through our country. It devastated families. But once again, our great country has risen up as one. The wizard alien... is dead. Sex addiction is no more. And if a rich celebrity is caught again trying to screw lots of women, we will know it isn't because men are just like that, it's because a wizard alien has cast his mighty spell. [the crowd on the lawn jumps up and cheers]"
208,14,1,Randy Marsh,"[watching this on TV in the bedroom] Oh I'm so glad it's over, Sharon. Aren't you? [Sharon isn't paying any attention, preferring to read a book]"
209,14,1,News 4 Reporter,"We are now with the young boys who helped stop the alien. Boys, how does it feel to be free of your illness?"
210,14,1,Kyle Broflovski,[unsure] I guess it... feels great. Thanks. [Butters looks pissed off]
211,14,1,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, it feels great! I never wanna see bush again! [swats the reporter's hand away and walks towards the camera] I finally paid a lady to show me hers. You wanna know what's under that bush? Nothin' but a pair of sick Joker lips."
212,14,1,Tiger and Elin Woods,"I am so happy that I am cured, and no longer have any desire to have sex with anyone but my beautiful wife. Now I can be faithful. And my wife won't feel any need to get revenge by sleeping with a bunch of guys. [she glances at him, he glances at her, she glances back at him] So I officially announce my return to golf."
213,14,1,Eric Cartman,What the hell?! This game's all boring now!
214,14,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, where's all the fighting?"
215,14,1,Eric Cartman,"Dude, screw this! [gets off the sofa and throws his controller to the floor, then walks away] Who wants to hit a dumb little ball around?!"
216,14,1,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, golf is stupid again. [gets off the sofa and tosses his controller onto the sofa, then follows Cartman out]"
217,14,2,Mr Garrison,"Okay kids, let's take our seats. [sets the box down on the desk] There has been a change in school policy, and so I'm assigning you all a book to read."
218,14,2,Eric Cartman,"[sarcastically, folds his arms together] Aww, books? God, I hate those!"
219,14,2,Mr Garrison,"Now, kids, this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list. [the book in question is J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye]"
220,14,2,Eric Cartman,Oh really? Sweet.
221,14,2,Mr Garrison,"It's called The Catcher In The Rye, and it has some very... risqué parts... [begins handing out the books individually]"
222,14,2,Stan Marsh,All right!
223,14,2,Mr Garrison,...and strong vulgar language...
224,14,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Awesome, dude!)"
225,14,2,Mr Garrison,...and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because it's thought to be so inappropriate.
226,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Oho man, I can't wait!"
227,14,2,Mr Garrison,"Tonight I want you to read chapters one through five, and tomorrow we'll discuss the-"
228,14,2,Eric Cartman,"No on, come on, let's read it now!"
229,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Mr. Garrison, didn't the guy who shot John Lennon say it was because of this book?"
230,14,2,Mr Garrison,"Uh-yes, apparently John Lennon's killer said he was inspired by The Catcher In The Rye, but he was just a kook! [jabs his left index finger at the floor]"
231,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, you're telling us this book is filthy, inappropriate, and made a guy shoot the king of hippies? Can we please read this right now?!"
232,14,2,Mr Garrison,"You will read it at home, [jabs his left index finger at the floor again, then puts his palms on his hips] and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language!"
233,14,2,Class,Awww!
234,14,2,Stan Marsh,Did you get to any dirty parts yet?
235,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it's still just some whiny, annoying teenager talking about how lame he is."
236,14,2,Stan Marsh,"[turns the page] I don't get it dude, w-what's so controversial about this? All he's done is said ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a few times."
237,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,I know. I'm almost at the end and there's nothing. [the door opens and a pissed-off Cartman enters and closes the door]
238,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Motherfucker! [Kyle turns around to face him, Stan stands up and walks up to him] The whole thing! I read the whole fucking thing! I kept thinking, ""alright, I guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming,"" and then after like a hundred pages I was like ""alright, I guess all the dirty stuff is at the end,"" and then I got to the last page, and I was all ""the fuck is this?! I just read a book! For nothing!"""
239,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,[picks up his book] Why the hell was this book banned?!
240,14,2,Eric Cartman,"They fucking tricked us, that's what they did! Tricked us into reading a book by, enticing us with promises of vulgarity! [the door opens again and Kenny enters with his book]"
241,14,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, what the fuck is so filthy or offensive in here?)"
242,14,2,Eric Cartman,"We know, we were just saying that."
243,14,2,Stan Marsh,Why would anyone think this book so obscene or dangerous?
244,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Kill John Lennon... [leaves his chair and walks across the kitchen] Kill John Lennon... Kill John Lennon... [reaches into a bottom drawer and pulls out a large steak knife] Kill John Lennon! [walks by his dad's study and stops to look in] Hey dad, where does John Lennon live?"
245,14,2,Stephen Stotch,"John Lennon's dead, Butters."
246,14,2,Butters Stotch,[lowers the knife instantly] Aww. Dangit. [drops it and walks away]
247,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, some people really do consider this obscene."
248,14,2,Eric Cartman,"It's not obscene, dude! I'll show them fucking obscene!"
249,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey yeah, we should write our own banned book. [Kyle breaks into a grin]"
250,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we could get a book banned way more than this one."
251,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, sweet."
252,14,2,Kenny McCormick,(Awesome.)
253,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[starts typing] The Tale of... [can't think of anything, so his smile disappears]"
254,14,2,Eric Cartman,The Tale of... Scrotie McDickinass.
255,14,2,Kenny McCormick,"(No, No, Scrotie McBoogerballs)"
256,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh that's, [giggles] yeah that's good, that's good. Alright, chapter... one..."
257,14,2,Eric Cartman,"It was a... a warm spring morning. [background music plays and a montage follows. Next is the school playground where, as other kids play, Stan and the other three sit on the steps of a side entrance and continue working on their book, with Cartman taking notes Next is Stan's room where Stan is typing the next part of the book. The boys are having fun with the writing. Next scene is in Cartman's room where Cartman is again writing the story down. Kyle has brought Ike over for company. Finally, a few days later, Sharon enters Stan's room to put away his clean clothes. She puts away some underwear, but notices something in the drawer. Under Stan's shirts is the manuscript to the story the boys have been working on. Sharon reaches for it.]"
258,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"""The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs""? [goes to the first page] ""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find his""... [reads silently] Ew. ""He took a..."" [stunned] What? Oh. OH! Oh my God! ""He then grabbed his dog's"" [stifles a gag but can't hold it in, and barfs] Ehohoh, oh my God! ""Walking out of his house he spotted the bloodiest pus-covered"" [tries not to barf again, but can't hold it in] Nooo! Nooo! [reads some more, but then coughs, then barfs] Noho! Nooo! [Sharon then falls unconscious and rolls on her back]"
259,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"Randy? [spots him working on a small wooden ship and runs in] Randy! Randy, you need to read this!"
260,14,2,Randy Marsh,Read what?
261,14,2,Sharon Marsh,This book! Our son and his friends wrote it!
262,14,2,Randy Marsh,So?
263,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"Soo? Randy, it's, it's, it's really good!"
264,14,2,Randy Marsh,Huh?
265,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"I mean it's disgusting. [hands the manuscript over to him] It's, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever read, but, the plot is amazing. And the characters are so... vivid!"
266,14,2,Randy Marsh,"""It was a warm summer morning when Scrotie McBoogerballs awoke to find hi-"" Ew, Sharon, gross!"
267,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"Nono, just keep reading."
268,14,2,Randy Marsh,"""He took a- and then-"" Oh, man. Oh, this- [turns to his left and barfs on the floor. Sharon turns away and shields herself]"
269,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"I know. I know, Randy, but trust me. You've gotta push through to the end."
270,14,2,Randy Marsh,"Noo, noo, that's just WRONG!"
271,14,2,Sharon Marsh,Randy please! You've got to listen to me!
272,14,2,Randy Marsh,"""Walking out of the house he found a bloody pu-"" What? ""He immediately stuck up his im...fected ba-"" [barfs again. He spends a couple hours more reading, and finally reaches the last few pages. There's a pail in front of him now, but the vomit has gone all over the place. He has a small towel in his left hand covered in vomit. His voice is now soft and beat] ""That was all long ago in some brief lost spring, in a place that is no more. In that hour the vaj frogs begin and the scent off Scrotie's infected anus becomes its strongest."" Oh... Oh, man."
273,14,2,Sharon Marsh,Well?
274,14,2,Randy Marsh,It's... it's awesome. Sharon it's it's the best book I've ever read.
275,14,2,Sharon Marsh,Right? It's not just me.
276,14,2,Randy Marsh,"No, it's... I mean, the whole part about Amsterdam, wow!"
277,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"What do we do, Randy? We can't support our son talking like this, but I, I mean."
278,14,2,Randy Marsh,"NO! I kn... I know! People need to read this book, Sharon, this is... this is Pulitzer prize stuff."
279,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Hehehhh, you're dead, Kenny!"
280,14,2,Stan Marsh,"[runs into the living room in a panic] Guys, guys! We are totally fucked! The book is gone from my dresser drawer. My parents must have found it!"
281,14,2,Eric Cartman,...so why are we all fucked? They'll think you wrote it all.
282,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey hey! I'm not taking the heat for this alone! We all wrote it! If I'm going down, somebody has to go down with me!"
283,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Well if I'm going down, Cartman's going down!"
284,14,2,Eric Cartman,"And if I'm going down, both Kyle and Kenny are definitely going down!"
285,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Well dude, somebody has got to go down!"
286,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, what are you up to?"
287,14,2,Butters Stotch,Oh hey fellas. I'm just watching the Kardashians
288,14,2,Kim Kardashian,Today my sisters and I are gonna have to wash something. It's gonna blow!
289,14,2,Butters Stotch,Kim Kardashian is sooo sexy. Her butt is like a biiig mountain of pudding.
290,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Butters, listen: you are in big trouble!"
291,14,2,Butters Stotch,I am?
292,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, you remember that book you wrote? Stan's mom found it."
293,14,2,Butters Stotch,Oh no. Which book was that?
294,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, the book you left with us when you were sleepwalking last night!"
295,14,2,Butters Stotch,I don't even remember that. [gasps] But it all makes sense now. Ever since I read The Catcher In The Rye I've been having these... blackouts. Crazy thoughts of wanting to kill the phonies. I must have channeled all my angst into dark writings in my sleep!
296,14,2,Sharon Marsh,"Alright boys, we need to get to the bottom of this."
297,14,2,Sheila Broflovski,We've all read the book now and it is very shocking to say the least.
298,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Okay, well... a-actually it was all written by... Butters. [Butters walks in hanging his head]"
299,14,2,Eric Cartman,That's right.
300,14,2,Randy Marsh,Butters? Is that true?
301,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, though I barely remember it, but I know I did."
302,14,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Well Butters, we think... that this is one of the BEST books we've ever read."
303,14,2,Butters Stotch,Huh?
304,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,What? [the other boys can't believe it]
305,14,2,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, it's really amazing."
306,14,2,Butters Stotch,"[brightens up] Oh, thanks."
307,14,2,Sheila Broflovski,"We were actually so moved by your book, Butters, that we brought Mr. Needlebaum from Penguin Publishing to read it."
308,14,2,Mr Needlebaum,"Mr. Butters, we would like to offer you a deal for first publishing rights to your brilliant novel."
309,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey, wait a minute, that's ours!"
310,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, we wrote that!"
311,14,2,Randy Marsh,"Ohkay boys, you already told the truth."
312,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, no, w-we we really did write it. Tell them, Butters."
313,14,2,Butters Stotch,I wrote that. [the adults begin to murmur amongst themselves]
314,14,2,Stephen Stotch,Really amazing.
315,14,2,Stan Marsh,What? Hey! [Butters is pleased for once]
316,14,2,A News Anchor,"It is being called the most disgusting, foul, sickening book ever written, and it is also being called ""literary genius."" The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this weekend, and so far no one has been able to get through the first paragraph without vomiting."
317,14,2,A News Anchor,The book has already sold millions of copies worldwide aaand has been translated into twenty six languages.
318,14,2,A News Anchor,"The book is changing the literary world. And it is all thanks... to Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. [a picture of Butters in a pensive pose pops up]"
319,14,2,Clyde,"Hey, here he comes!"
320,14,2,Mr Adler,"Amazing book, Butters. [Mr. Garrison comes out of his classroom]"
321,14,2,Butters Stotch,Thank you! [clasps his hands together and congratulates himself as he walks down the hallway]
322,14,2,Mrs Streibel,"You've changed my life, young man."
323,14,2,Butters Stotch,"That's nice. [waves to everyone and walks on, but runs into Stan and the boys, who are mad at him]"
324,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Butters, what the fuck do you think you're doing?!"
325,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Just enjoying myself. Why, Eric?"
326,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, you know goddamned well you didn't write that book!"
327,14,2,Butters Stotch,"But, you told me I did!"
328,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble, asshole! [two girls rush up to Butters' aid]"
329,14,2,Red,"Hey hey, you leave Butters alone! He's a very fragile artist."
330,14,2,Lola,He's so brooding and full of angst.
331,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, I'm broooding."
332,14,2,Eric Cartman,Butters doesn't deserve any credit for Scrotie McBoogerballs! We deserve all the credit!
333,14,2,Rebecca,"Oh God, you guys are pathetic!"
334,14,2,Lola,"Yeah, get a life and stop mooching off others' success for once. [the girls leave]"
335,14,2,Stan Marsh,God-damnit!
336,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, do you really think it's fair to lie like this?! Let me tell you, if you don't have the-"
337,14,2,Butters Stotch,"No, let me tell you somethin', fellers! You always take advantage of me, and after reading The Catcher in the Rye, I've learned you're nothing but phonies! I'm not letting you trick me this time! So the four of you can just suck on my wiener!"
338,14,2,Eric Cartman,That inconsiderate jerk!
339,14,2,An Announcer,"Today on Today: We meet the author of the book that has swept the nation, and has now spawned TV's most popular game show, ""How Long Can You Listen To Scrotie McBoogerballs On Audiobook"" [the studio audience joins in] ""And Not Vomit?"" [a contestant is fitted with headphones and place in a soundproof booth. The front panel is a glass door so the audience can see the contestant's reaction without getting sprayed with vomit. It only takes two seconds of listening before the contestant vomits all over the door] The book is full of disgusting words and acts, including Sarah Jessica Parker, who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times. [a shot of Parker and her date at the Oscars] Matthew Broderick, are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book?"
340,14,2,Matthew Broderick,"Well, obviously. I just think it's wrong to make fun of anybody's physical appearance. My wife is a beautiful woman and I know that most people agree with me."
341,14,2,An Announcer,"Uh huh, and Matthew, how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you, and why is it wearing a dress? [cut to a shot of the Stotch family sitting in Butters' room]"
342,14,2,Matt Lauer,"Joining us now is the author of the book, Leopold Stotch, along with his parents."
343,14,2,Stephen Stotch,Hello Matt
344,14,2,Linda Stotch,Hi everyone.
345,14,2,Matt Lauer,You must be pretty proud of your son.
346,14,2,Stephen Stotch,"Oh, we certainly are. We're thrilled to learn he's so very talented."
347,14,2,Meredith Vieira,And we also learned that your son is grounded. Is that correct?
348,14,2,Stephen Stotch,"Yes, we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course."
349,14,2,Butters Stotch,I have to come right to my room after school.
350,14,2,Stephen Stotch,But we are very very proud nonetheless.
351,14,2,Al Roker,"[chuckles] Young man, now that you are a respected author, have you met any famous people?"
352,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Not yet, but as soon as I'm not grounded anymore, I'm hopin' to meet Kim Kardashian. I wanna jump on her belly."
353,14,2,Matt Lauer,"All right, uh, yeah huh. Butters, my favorite part of your novel was when Scrotie McBoogerballs slid his head up into the horse's [jumps off his stool and tries to vomit into a pail nearby, but misses. He vomits agin and this time gets it into the pail, burps, and coughs a few times, getting the last of the vomit into the pail, and finally spits. He gets back on the stool] Sorry, I uh, was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested?"
354,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Uh... yeah, pretty much, I think, think so."
355,14,2,Meredith Vieira,Is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings? [begins to vomit immediately]
356,14,2,Al Roker,"Little boy, are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone, like when that guy tried to shoot Ronald Reagan after reading The Catcher in the Rye?"
357,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh, is that who the book was tellin' me to kill? Ohhh. [gets into a trance] Kill Ronald Reagan. [hops off his bed and heads for the door] Kill Ronald Reagan."
358,14,2,Al Roker,"Ronald Reagan is dead now, Butters."
359,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh really? [goes back to his bed] Oh yeah, gosh dangit."
360,14,2,Stan Marsh,"More and more of us are against this book every day! The author is cruel and offensive! And for these reasons, we demand this book be banned from all school, stores, and libraries! This book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity!"
361,14,2,Assemblyman 1,That's just because you're too young to understand the underlying themes.
362,14,2,Eric Cartman,There are no underlying themes! We know that for a fact!
363,14,2,Assemblyman 2,You just fail to understand what the author meant.
364,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,The author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny!
365,14,2,Assemblyman 3,"[chuckles] No, no no, that's such a simplistic view."
366,14,2,Stan Marsh,Goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book! Read it again!
367,14,2,Assemblywoman 1,"Oh, so you're suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of Sarah Jessica Parker for no reason?"
368,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yes!
369,14,2,Assemblywoman 1,But what would be the point?
370,14,2,Eric Cartman,There is no point! It's just because Sarah Jessica Parker is fuckin' ugly!
371,14,2,Assemblywoman 2,No writer would take the time to make fun of Sarah Jessica Parker just because they think she's ugly.
372,14,2,Stan Marsh,Yes they would!
373,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yes they would!
374,14,2,Eric Cartman,Yes they would!
375,14,2,Assemblywoman 2,It is because Miss Jessica Parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class.
376,14,2,Stan Marsh,"What? Dude, that is not in the book at all!"
377,14,2,Assemblyman 2,"Boys, this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country."
378,14,2,Stan Marsh,What?
379,14,2,Assemblywoman 2,"Wait, Scrotie McBoogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature!"
380,14,2,Assemblyman 2,What book did you read?!
381,14,2,Stan Marsh,There's nothing about liberals or conservatives!
382,14,2,Assemblyman 4,"Ohohh yeah, then why did Sarah Jessica Parker's butt-cheese end up in Scrotie's milkshake? [an assemblyman nearby throws up]"
383,14,2,A Field Reporter,"Breaking news from acclaimed author Leopold Stotch. The artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller. We got a statement from the writer, who is still grounded in his room. [The reporter and Butters are yelling at each other to be heard.]"
384,14,2,A Field Reporter,Can you give the public any idea what the new book is about?
385,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Well, it's kind of about love and betrayal! The inner workings of the human mind!"
386,14,2,A Field Reporter,Will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book?
387,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh it's raunchy alright! I know what my readers want, and I'm going to deliver!"
388,14,2,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, away from the window! You are being grounded!"
389,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Sorry Dad, I was just bein' the voice of a generation. [walks out of view]"
390,14,2,Stan Marsh,I can't believe they won't ban our book!
391,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,I know! It's so much worse than Catcher in the retarded Rye!
392,14,2,Kenny McCormick,(It's fucking disgusting!)
393,14,2,Eric Cartman,"All right you guys, I know what we have to do. [stands up and walks onto the street] We've got to kill Sarah Jessica Parker."
394,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,What?! [Stan's hands go from his chin to his knees]
395,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Think about it, guys. If somebody kills Sarah Jessica Parker, then they'll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book. Then the book will get banned."
396,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, we're not killing Sarah Jessica Parker! [Sarah Jessica Parker hears her name and looks at the boys]"
397,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Shhh. [addresses Ms. Parker] Be right with you. [hushed tones to the other boys] We don't have to kill her, we can just help her get killed."
398,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Shut up, Cartman! Just face it. We lost this one. [he and Kyle walk away]"
399,14,2,Eric Cartman,Kenny... we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at Butters.
400,14,2,Kenny McCormick,"[looks over at Ms. Parker, then at Cartman] (Okay.)"
401,14,2,Eric Cartman,"[turns and walks over to Ms. Parker] Ms. Jessica Parker, over here. [Kenny follows.]"
402,14,2,Matt Lauer,"Well, the day has finally arrived. The eagerly awaited second novel from the author of Scrotie McBoogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently, bookstores are jammed."
403,14,2,Meredith Vieira,"Al, how is it out there?"
404,14,2,Al Roker,"[giggles] I don't know if you could see this, guys, but uh, the line stretches all the way around the block. People waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel. [the camera pans across the line from front to back and back again. The people in line smile and wave at the camera] And they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in. Just a festive atmosphere here, Matt and Meredith."
405,14,2,Meredith Vieira,"Well, we've got our vomit buckets ready too, because coming up, a very special in-studio treat."
406,14,2,Matt Lauer,"That's right, we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio. Na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic, obscene novel of all time, so... brace yourselves for some very harsh language. Take it away Morgan Freeman."
407,14,2,Morgan Freeman,"[reading slowly, with gravitas] The Poop That Took A Pee Chapter 1: Douglas had to poop. His butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly. There was a gross woman named Rebecca who was sunbathing all naked, and she was fat. Douglas walked up to her and said, ""I need to poop."" ""Okay,"" Rebecca replied, ""I like poop."" Douglas squatted down [turns the page] over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop. The poop sat there on Rebecca's boobs looking like a wiener. [turns the page] Chapter 2..."
408,14,2,Eric Cartman,See any hunters yet?
409,14,2,Kenny McCormick,(Not yet) [Ms. Parker is in a nearby clearing with moose horns attached to her head]
410,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Doing good, Ms. Jessica Parker! Just hang out, right there."
411,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Guys, stop, stop! [Kyle and Stan walk into view towards Cartman and Kenny] We don't have to do this!"
412,14,2,Kenny McCormick,(Huh?)
413,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,Butters wrote a second book!
414,14,2,Eric Cartman,So what?
415,14,2,Stan Marsh,"So dude, if Butters wrote a second book, then everyone's gonna know he couldn't have written the first one!"
416,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,We can get people to believe us now!
417,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh dude, sweet! [all four boys walk away, leaving Ms. Parker all alone at the mercy of any moose hunter that walks by her]"
418,14,2,Morgan Freeman,"""Why are we here?"" Douglas cried as poop came out his wiener, in a long, thin strip. It was... wiener poop, which is the grossest poop of all."
419,14,2,Shopper 1,"""The pee he got on the woman's leg, and she screamed, pooping out her boobs."""
420,14,2,Shopper 2,"""And so when the pee got mixed with the poop, it smelled like a butt."""
421,14,2,Stan Marsh,"[in store with the other boys] Aw dude, this is even lamer than we thought. [grins]"
422,14,2,Eric Cartman,People are gonna want Butters' head on a platter!
423,14,2,Shopper 3,"Are you reading this, Marsha? What do you think?"
424,14,2,Some Woman Named Marsha,"So far I think it's, it's incredible! Ih, it might be better than his first book."
425,14,2,Shopper 4,"I agree. It wasn't as edgy, but it's like, he he's gone back to his roots."
426,14,2,Eric Cartman,What?!
427,14,2,Stan Marsh,You can't be serious! You people like this?!
428,14,2,Shopper 5,Some of the imagery is unbelievable
429,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,A woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery!
430,14,2,Shopper 6,"Says you! You must be a pro-life nut, huh? [slides into taunting] Didn't like what the book had to say?"
431,14,2,Some Woman Named Marsha,What are you talking about? This book is as pro-life as it gets!
432,14,2,Eric Cartman,Oh come on!
433,14,2,Stan Marsh,"God-damnit, will you people stop reading into stuff that isn't there!!"
434,14,2,Shopper 7,"""And the poop and the pee lived happily every after. The end."" [closes the book...] Kill the phonies. Kill the phonies!"
435,14,2,Kim Kardashian,Today my sisters and I are gonna shop for underwear.
436,14,2,The rest of the Kardashians,Yaaay!
437,14,2,Male Guest,Can I go with you girls? [the seventh shopper breaks into the set and guns everyone down]
438,14,2,News Anchor 2,"Our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the Kardashians. The shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading The Poop That Took A Pee by Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch. It's all over. The Kardiashians.. [cries a bit and sheds a tear] wiped out. In the blink of an eye. All because one little PRICK... had to go and write a book."
439,14,2,News Anchor 2,Leopold Stotch... I HOPE THEY BURY YOU! ...YOU EVIL FUCK! [the anchorman falls silent and the door opens. Cartman and the other boys enter]
440,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Dude, people are pissed off at you, Butters."
441,14,2,Butters Stotch,I know.
442,14,2,Stan Marsh,"They're saying they're gonna ban both your books now, completely. You're not making any more money!"
443,14,2,Butters Stotch,[lifts his head up. He's been crying] You think I care about that? My writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed! I loved her! And if she died it was because of me!
444,14,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Ah... Oh Butters, [steps forward] it'll be all right. Listen, we've all learned that people look for meaning in books. And sometimes, even if it isn't there, they'll try and invent their own meaning."
445,14,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude, eh, that's why we all need to avoid books and stick to television."
446,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Thang, thanks, fellas. I'll definitely never write again. I think I can get over this."
447,14,2,Eric Cartman,"That's good, Butters, because, we need to tell you something."
448,14,2,Butters Stotch,What?
449,14,2,Eric Cartman,[sighs heavily] You were sleepwalking again and dressed Sarah Jessica Parker up in a moose suit. You left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter.
450,14,2,Butters Stotch,What?! Oh no!
451,14,2,Eric Cartman,"Yep, sorry. You're gonna have to come down and admit it was you. [walks out of the room with the other boys]"
452,14,2,Butters Stotch,"Aw. Aw I got her killed too? Aw uh, oh well, at least she was ugly. [leaves his desk and follows the other boys downstairs]"
453,14,3,Group,"Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty."
454,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[after ""27""] Oh I wish I could exercise with the rest of the team, coach, but I've got such a belly ache."
455,14,3,Coach,You seem to have a stomach ache every time we do drills and exercises.
456,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[faking] I know, it sucks. [the coach blows his whistle as the boys reach ""40""]"
457,14,3,Coach,"Alright kids, practice is over for today."
458,14,3,Eric Cartman,[grins and throws his sports bottle away] KFC!! [races for his ride]
459,14,3,Eric Cartman,Oh boy oh boy! I'm gonna get a three piece meal and crispy strips!
460,14,3,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you only come to soccer practice on Fridays, and that's only because we have Kentucky Fried Chicken afterwards!"
461,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Shut up you shifty Jew! I'll fuckin' kill you! [remembers where he is] Uh sorry, sorry. I just, you know, when I've been waiting too long for the Colonel's chicken I get easily agitated. You're a fuckin' asshole Kenny! Oh oh oh, sorry sorry. Oh here we are! Here we are!"
462,14,3,Stan Marsh,Hey it looks different.
463,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[to the customer] Hey uh, what's up with the KFC?"
464,14,3,Customer,"[stops] Oh, it's not a KFC anymore. It's a medicinal marijuana dispensary. [walks away]"
465,14,3,Stan Marsh,A what?
466,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?!"
467,14,3,Kyle Broflovski,So where's the KFC now?
468,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Alright boys, wait out here. Let me see what's going on. [leaves them and enters the store.]"
469,14,3,Clerk,Can I help you sir?
470,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, we were actually looking to get some KFC?"
471,14,3,Clerk,"Oh yeah sorry, that's gone. We only sell marijuana here."
472,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Really? I mean, you're openly selling pot? For reals?"
473,14,3,Clerk,Sure. New state laws say it's okay.
474,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[thinks about what this means] Woohoo, all right! I love the future! Let's see uh, I'll take half a pound of that uhhh Jamaican Passion [goes to another counter] and give me some of that purplish stuff too!"
475,14,3,Clerk,Alright. I'll just need to see your physician's reference.
476,14,3,Randy Marsh,[his smile vanishes] My huh?
477,14,3,Clerk,"Well, sir we, just can't, sell the marijuana to anybody. You need a reference from your doctor to show it's necessary."
478,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Ohhh, that's dumb. Okay. Okay, I'll be I'll be right back! [races out the door]"
479,14,3,Stan Marsh,What'd they say?
480,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[speaking quickly] KFC's gone, been replaced."
481,14,3,Eric Cartman,They can't do that! This is the only KFC in all of South Park!
482,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah well I gotta get to the doctor. [runs to the car, opens the driver-side door, and quickly gets in]"
483,14,3,Stan Marsh,"The doctor? But Dad, we wanna eat."
484,14,3,Randy Marsh,"I gotta get to the doctor! [pulls out of his parking slot and drives away in a hurry, leaving the boys by themselves]"
485,14,3,Kyle Broflovski,...so no KFC?
486,14,3,Eric Cartman,This is a nightmare. This is a nightmare and I CAN'T WAKE UP!
487,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Well Mr. Marsh, it looks like you are in prefect health. Your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal."
488,14,3,Randy Marsh,All right!
489,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Yep, you check out fine."
490,14,3,Randy Marsh,That's great. So can I get a referral from you?
491,14,3,Dr Doctor,For what?
492,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Medicinal marijuana. [the doctor frowns] There's a shop that opened in the old KFC, and they said I needed a doctor's referral to buy weed."
493,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, you don't qualify for medicinal marijuana."
494,14,3,Randy Marsh,But you said I'm totally healthy!
495,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Medicinal marijuana is for people who aren't healthy. AIDS patients, cancer patients. You know, people going through chemo. The THC helps them eat and take the pain. You are in fine shape!"
496,14,3,Randy Marsh,"...Well that sucks! [gets off the bed and puts his clothes back on.] Well so doctor, how do most people get cancer?"
497,14,3,Dr Doctor,Well there's a lot of ways you can get cancer.
498,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but what's the quickest way?"
499,14,3,Dr Doctor,The what?
500,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Well like, what forms of cancer induce in time for the Ziggy Marley concert next Saturday in Denver?"
501,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Mom, drive faster!"
502,14,3,Liane Cartman,"The KFC in Salida is a long way away, sweetie. Be patient."
503,14,3,Eric Cartman,Shut up and drive faster! I've been waiting for chicken for TOO LONG!
504,14,3,Liane Cartman,"Eric, we're almost to Frisco. Why don't we go to the Church's Fried Chicken there?"
505,14,3,Eric Cartman,WHAT?? Church's Fried Chicken tastes like cat shit!
506,14,3,Liane Cartman,"Alright honey, let's take it easy."
507,14,3,Eric Cartman,Fuck you!
508,14,3,Eric Cartman,"No! No, what's going on?! [quickly gets out of the car and shoves a worker aside] Move aside! [stops at the front door and looks up again]"
509,14,3,Worker 1,"It's closed, kid, there's nothin' in there."
510,14,3,Eric Cartman,"No you, you can't do this! The KFC in my town is closed too!"
511,14,3,Worker 1,"Yeah, well, that's because of the vote last November to ban fast food in low-income areas."
512,14,3,Eric Cartman,You mean I have to drive all the way to Denver to get chicken?!
513,14,3,Worker 2,"No you don't get it, kid. KFCs were only in low-income areas. In the entire state of Colorado, Kentucky Fried Chicken is illegal."
514,14,3,Eric Cartman,Nooooooooo-! [his head explodes]
515,14,3,Stan Marsh,"[opens the sliding door and looks out] Dad, Mom says to stop trying to give yourself cancer."
516,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Just gonna get a little bit of cancer, Stan. Tell Mom it's okay. [Stan walks away and closes the sliding door]"
517,14,3,Clerk 2,Can I help you?
518,14,3,Eric Cartman,[looking fatigued and feeling quite itchy] I need... Somebody said you... could help me. I... have to... I haven't... had... KFC... in over... a week. [sniffs heavily]
519,14,3,Clerk 2,"Alright, sign your name on the release form and put down the time-"
520,14,3,Eric Cartman,[hops onto a little stool in front of the counter] Really?
521,14,3,Clerk 2,-your birth year. and we'll get you through the next twenty-four hours. [hands him an application]
522,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, what uh, are you serious? [fills out the application as she gets a treatment out of a cabinet. He turns around...] Oh my God, that's KFC gravy! [quite giddy] You have KFC! Yes! [she opens the gravy and pours some into a small cup, then slides the cup to him. He's disappointed] This is it? One lousy little cup of gravy?!"
523,14,3,Clerk 2,This is a clinic to help you get over your addiction.
524,14,3,Eric Cartman,Who wants just gravy?! It goes on mashed potatoes! On extra-crispy chicken skins!
525,14,3,Clerk 2,"[takes the cup back] If you don't want it, that's fine-"
526,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[grabs it from her hand] NO! [swallows it as fast as he can] Oh God, oh God it's so good."
527,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[reading from the book ""Cancer Today""] ""Frozen and processed foods appear to have a direct link to many forms of stomach and colon cancers."" Alright. [takes the plate and puts the nuggets into the microwave oven, sets the time to four minutes, then starts the oven] ""Tests show that preservatives found in these foods are the leading cause. However, luckily most of these cancers are..."" [he loses hope] ""slow-growing and can take years to develop."" Dammit. [turns the page] ""Testicular cancer. Most common in older men and can be extremely aggressive."" Oh this is good. ""There's no data on what causes testicular cancer to grow so rapidly, however the primary causes of testicular cancer are linked to exposure to high doses of radiation"" Hmmm. [closes the book and looks at the microwave and at his balls a few times. Some time later, Stan goes to the kitchen, opens the door, and grabs a sports energy drink, closes the door and walks away. He walks by Randy, who's got the microwave door open and his balls inside the oven.] Oh hey, Stan, could you grab me a beer? [Stan just looks at him and continues on his way.] Stan?"
528,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Whoahhh! Sharon. Hey, hey Sharon!"
529,14,3,Sharon Marsh,Wha... WAAAAA! [she almost lost her mind there]
530,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Mr. Marsh, I'm afraid that the tests came back positive. You do have testicular cancer."
531,14,3,Randy Marsh,SCORE! [Sharon is not happy]
532,14,3,Dr Doctor,"Now, the good new is it hasn't spread anywhere. We should... probably schedule to have them re-"
533,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Yeahyeahyeahyeah, but for now can I finally get my prescription please?!"
534,14,3,Dr Doctor,Your prescription for what?
535,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Buffalo Soldier... in the heart of America. Stolen from Africa, brought into America. He was fighting on arrival..."
536,14,3,Randy Marsh,"One ounce of Purple Lurple, two ounces of Fisherman's Friend, and a half ounce of Alabama Kush!"
537,14,3,Randy Marsh,Uh that is nice! That is nice!
538,14,3,Jimbo Kern,"[walks by, sees him, and runs over] Randy! Jesus, Randy. Your balls!"
539,14,3,Randy Marsh,"I know. Smokin' pot right in front of a cop. Pretty sweet, huh?"
540,14,3,Jimbo Kern,"No, I mean, your actual balls!"
541,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Oh, yeah. Testicular cancer. Here, here, you want some? Oh wait, you're healthy! Hey bust his ass, officer! [laughs]"
542,14,3,Tough Boy 1,"Hey kid, they say you're looking for some KFC."
543,14,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah. Who isn't?
544,14,3,Tough Boy 1,"Yeah well uh, we got some. Over at Billy Miller's house."
545,14,3,Eric Cartman,Billy Miller? Seriously??
546,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"Ahhh Eric Cartman, right?"
547,14,3,Eric Cartman,Tommy said you have some KFC.
548,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Suuure. [snaps his fingers and waves someone forward] Jessie. [a girl brings a tray with food over to Cartman]
549,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, the Colonel's popcorn chicken and honey-mustard sauce! [eats them as fast as he can] Oh God yes! [finishes it off] Where did you get that?!"
550,14,3,Billy and his Mom,I have my sources. That'll be $85.
551,14,3,Eric Cartman,85 bucks?? I don't have that! [three boys behind him get serious and approach him. One of them has a bat]
552,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"Hold on, hold on. [the boys stop] You're a big boy, Eric. Maybe you can pay me back another way. Do a little job for me. I've got some serious KFC coming in from a dealer. I need somebody willing to get a little risky and... pick it up."
553,14,3,Eric Cartman,How much KFC are we talking?
554,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides.
555,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Holy fuck, dude."
556,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"I've got the money to pay for it, but it's become a risky business out there. You get the chicken for me, and I'll make sure you're hooked up for life. Do you wanna do it?"
557,14,3,Eric Cartman,Do I wanna do it? Does the Pope help pedophiles get away with their crime?
558,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Excellent.
559,14,3,Randy Marsh,"[smokes, coughs a little] Alright, see you tomorrow! [turns left and has difficulty maneuvering his massive balls. He walks down the sidewalk happily and checks his watch] Oh God, I gotta hurry! Caprica starts in five minutes! [starts moving faster, but the wheelbarrow soon falls apart and he's left sitting on his balls.] Huh-oh Jesus! [looks around, unsure of what to do] Ugh, ohh. [tries to get his feet on the ground, but can't] Uhh, hey, can somebody..? [puffs on the joint, then pulls at his scrotum] ...Rrrr. Ugh, I gotta get home. [gets off his balls and starts pulling them down the street. He sits on them again and bounces on them] Hey, hey, hey, this can work. This could... Hey, it's like a hoppity hop. Aaahah. Whoa-ho. [bounces down the sidewalk]"
560,14,3,Eric Cartman,Are you Teabag?
561,14,3,Teabag,Maybe I am. Who's askin'?
562,14,3,Eric Cartman,Cut the crap. You got the stuff?
563,14,3,Teabag,"Oh, I got the hookup. Question is, you got the money? [Cartman hands him a wad of bills] Alright, we're in biz. [turns right and grabs a couple of bags of KFC food, then hands them to Cartman, who looks inside each bag] It's all there, man."
564,14,3,Eric Cartman,Extra crispy? [opens a small bowl of gravy and samples it carefully]
565,14,3,Teabag,"'Course, man, I ain't no fool."
566,14,3,Eric Cartman,You trying to fuck me dude? This is cut with Boston Market gravy!
567,14,3,Teabag,"Awww, it's all the same shit, man."
568,14,3,Eric Cartman,IT'S NOT THE SAME SHIT! [reaches behind his back for a pistol and aims it at Teabag]
569,14,3,Teabag,"Okay okay I'm sorry, oh... [gets on his knees and shields his face]"
570,14,3,Eric Cartman,You're cuttin' Colonel's gravy with Boston Market to try and save yourself some fuckin' money!
571,14,3,Teabag,I'll take back the gravy.
572,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[lunges at him with the pistol, making him get on all fours] Like anybody wants KFC without gravy!"
573,14,3,Teabag,"AAAH please. Please, I'm sorry! Take your money back! Take the KFC too! [Barbrady walks by and stops to look]"
574,14,3,Officer Barbrady,What's going on back there?
575,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Nothin', it's cool."
576,14,3,Jimbo Kern,"Alright, I'll call. Forty-five to you Ned."
577,14,3,Randy Marsh,[puffs on a joint and coughs] Oh man. This Rainy Day Woman is the bomb. You guys don't know what you're missing.
578,14,3,Nelson,"Well you know, you could share some of that with us, Randy."
579,14,3,Randy Marsh,"No, Nelson, that's illegal! I can smoke this because I have cancer."
580,14,3,Player 1,"Aw some on, just give us a little bit."
581,14,3,Player 2,Yeah.
582,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Get your own medicinal marijuana cards! You've all got perfectly good microwaves at home! Look, I'm telling you guys, it's awesome. I can have all the pot I want, I get around faster than walking, and, wherever I need a seat, I can just sit on my balls. And let me tell you something else. [a player listens a little more closely] Chicks... love 'em."
583,14,3,Nelson,Women love huge balls?
584,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Loove 'em. Everywhere I go, when I walk by, chicks are like turning their heads and going ""whaaa?"" I never knew how much women love guys' balls until I got these puppies. [pats his balls]"
585,14,3,Woman 1,"Travis, did you take out the garba-whaaa? [backs up at the sight of Randy's balls, then runs off]"
586,14,3,Randy Marsh,See?
587,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"Cartman my boy, you got the stuff?"
588,14,3,Eric Cartman,Yeah I got the stuff. [the other boys carry the bags away] And I got the money. [tosses the wad of bills back at Billy]
589,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Heyyy you're good Eric. I need people like you!
590,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Good, 'cause I ate a bunch of chicken on the way over here. [burps]"
591,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"That's alright Eric. I've got something big in the works. What if I told you... that I now have a direct line to get all the KFC we want here? I'm sending Tommy to Kentucky, to try and set up a little ""arrangement"" with the Colonel himself."
592,14,3,Eric Cartman,Wait a minute. You mean THE Colonel?
593,14,3,Billy and his Mom,That's right. And I'd like you to go as well and watch Tommy's back for me. Is that something you'd want to do?
594,14,3,Eric Cartman,Is that something I'd want to do? Is the Pope Catholic? And making the world safe for pedophiles?
595,14,3,Billy and his Mom,Excellent.
596,14,3,Nurse,"Doctor, Mr. Klein's test results came in. [hands the envelope to the doctor, who opens it and pulls the results out]"
597,14,3,Dr Doctor,What the hell is going on?
598,14,3,Nurse,Doctor?
599,14,3,Dr Doctor,This is the tenth case I've seen this week. It can't be a coincidence. Something in this town is giving men testicular cancer.
600,14,3,Jimbo Kern,"Heh, I am stoned off my ass!"
601,14,3,Player 3,I'm stoned off my balls! [another man laughs]
602,14,3,Randy Marsh,Anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed?
603,14,3,Woman 2,Wow. Those guys have nice balls.
604,14,3,Woman 3,Wish my man had balls like those.
605,14,3,Woman 2,Mmm.
606,14,3,The Colonel,"Our entire production is headquartered here, boys. We move over sixteen tons of chicken every month. Of course, with the new laws in Colorado my business has taken quite a hit. I'm worried other states might follow suit."
607,14,3,"Billy's boys, including Tommy","We know, Colonel, but we can get your chicken into the state. We just need a bulk deal, say, four ninety five a key?"
608,14,3,Eric Cartman,"I've got to hand it to you, Colonel. You have everything a man could want."
609,14,3,The Colonel,"I like you, Eric. There's no lying in you. Unfortunately, I don't feel the same about your friend. Cartman: Who? You mean Tommy? [looks over at Tommy, then stops walking. The Colonel stops as well - Tommy is missing.] Wait, where's he go?"
610,14,3,The Colonel,"Your partner is an informant for Jamie Oliver. [hands him some binoculars and shows him where Tommy is. Through the binoculars, Cartman sees Tommy being roughed up by two men inside a helicopter. One of the men shows Tommy where Cartman is. There's a noose around Tommy's neck. The guy who shows him where Cartman is throws him out of the helicopter and hangs him. Cartman is stunned, but quickly gets over it and laughs]"
611,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Dude, that was sweet! He's all choked."
612,14,3,The Colonel,And how do I know you're not a liar too?
613,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, Colonel! I've been your biggest supporter since I was two years old! I love your chicken! I love you!"
614,14,3,The Colonel,"I think... you and me can work this thing out, Eric. Do business together a long time."
615,14,3,Eric Cartman,Good.
616,14,3,The Colonel,"Just remember, I only tell you one time. Don't fuck me, Eric. Don't you ever try to fuck me. [Cartman keeps his mouth shut]"
617,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"[walks up] Randy! Randy, will you look at yourself? Your balls are getting bigger."
618,14,3,Randy Marsh,I know. They're pretty swollen. Kinda hurts. I'm gonna buy some more weed.
619,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, please. When you get back, do you think maybe we could make love again? [looks down at his balls]"
620,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Ohhh, someone's feeling frisky again. huh?"
621,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, it's just that I thought that more alone time would maybe be really-"
622,14,3,Randy Marsh,Hey. My eyes are up here.
623,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"I'm sorry, I just..."
624,14,3,Randy Marsh,"It's alright, I just want you to look at me when we make love and not just at my balls. I'll be home soon, babe. [sends her an air kiss and hops out]"
625,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Hey uh, could you uh, give me half a pound of that Suburban Sunrise, please?"
626,14,3,Clerk,"I'm sorry sir, but you have to be inside the store."
627,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Well eh, I'm right here, can you just... bring it over?"
628,14,3,Clerk,Selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal.
629,14,3,Randy Marsh,Look I'm startin' to feel kind of stupid; can I please get high?
630,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"What, are you crazy Eric?! Making a deal with the Colonel for ten thousand more boxes?! I can't move that much chicken!"
631,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[munching on a breast from a bucket] Will you relax, Billy? It's fine!"
632,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"...Fine? I'm not making any money here! I'm losing it! I have to pay for more security, I got the cops up my ass, and I have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution!"
633,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[munching on a drumstick, his back to Billy] Billy, Billy, we've gotta be thinking bigger here! It's time to expand!"
634,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"How can I expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you?! Get out there and sell the chicken or get lost! You've forgotten who the boss of this operation is, Eric!"
635,14,3,Eric Cartman,"...Yeah welll, you're not gonna be around a lot longer."
636,14,3,Billy and his Mom,What is that supposed to mean?
637,14,3,Eric Cartman,I... [turns around to face Billy] told your mom you got an F on that social studies test.
638,14,3,Billy and his Mom,[suddenly vulnerable] You wouldn't do that.
639,14,3,Eric Cartman,Does a bear crap in the woods? And does the Pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys?
640,14,3,Billy s Mom,Billy?! Your father and I want to talk to you!
641,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Bye bye Billy. [Billy leaves] Alright everyone listen up! I'm in charge now! Anybody got a problem with that? Alright, good."
642,14,3,Randy Marsh,What do we want?
643,14,3,Men,Bigger doors!
644,14,3,Randy Marsh,Where do we want them?
645,14,3,Men,Weed stores!
646,14,3,Randy Marsh,What do we want?
647,14,3,Men,Bigger doors!
648,14,3,Randy Marsh,Where do we want them?
649,14,3,Men,Weed stores!
650,14,3,Clerk,"Look, I'm sorry, but the bill says I can't modify any existing structure."
651,14,3,Man 1,Well I guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop.
652,14,3,Man 2,"Egah I don't know, maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others."
653,14,3,Clerk,"Look, can't we skip all this and just make pot legal? Everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway, it's ridiculous."
654,14,3,Man 3,What's ridiculous about it?
655,14,3,Dr Doctor,"[runs through the crowd] Hold on, hold people people, please! [stops] We are all forgetting what is really at issue here! Look around! These men all have cancer! It's no coincidence that when this building changed, the rise in cancer went up. Don't you see? The KFC was keeping people healthy!"
656,14,3,Tough Boy 2,"Mr. Cartman, come on. We're supposed to be handling the business; you're eating too much of the stuff."
657,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Shut up Kevin! I'm the boss, not you, buttlicker!"
658,14,3,Tough Boy 3,"Eric, the Colonel is on the phone for you. He sounds pissed."
659,14,3,Eric Cartman,"What?! Oh, that's right, I forgot to- Dammit! Uh, okay. [leaves the throne] Put him on speaker."
660,14,3,The Colonel,Hello. Hello??
661,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Colonel, how are you doing?"
662,14,3,The Colonel,What happened?
663,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[rips the skin off a breast and lays it on the table] Oh, we had some problems, you know? Colonel? [takes out a credit card and starts mincing the skin as if it were crack cocaine, into lines of finely ground skin]"
664,14,3,The Colonel,"Eric, what happened??"
665,14,3,Eric Cartman,We had a little problem.
666,14,3,The Colonel,I heard.
667,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[snorts a line into his nose] Yeah? How'd, how'd you hear that?"
668,14,3,The Colonel,"Because Jamie Oliver gave his speech at the UN today. He was not supposed to give that speech, Eric!"
669,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey that's okay, we'll get him next time."
670,14,3,The Colonel,There's not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker!
671,14,3,Eric Cartman,"Hey, take it easy Colonel."
672,14,3,The Colonel,"I told you a long time ago, you fucking little monkey, not to fuck me!"
673,14,3,Eric Cartman,"[grabs the phone] Hey! Hey who the fuck do you think you're talking to, huh?! Huh?! [hears someone breaking in and looks over his shoulder] Oh crap! [five men pour into the basement and start firing their machine guns at the boys, who scatter and try to escape. Two more men jump into the basement. More men outside the house begin firing their weapons. The police arrive and begin firing at the attackers]"
674,14,3,Officer Barbrady,Freeze!
675,14,3,Henchman,"It's the cops! [Barbrady kills him. Another attacker is killed nearby. Cartman looks outside from the basement and begins his escape. Billy and his mom begin their escape as well, but through the front door]"
676,14,3,Billy s Mom,"Run Billy, run! [a bullet kills her. Cartman leaves the basement and escapes]"
677,14,3,Billy and his Mom,"Mommy, no!"
678,14,3,Officer Barbrady,"Last November, this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some. Since then we've had underground black markets, crime, death, and shootings. But now the bill has been repealed, and I am relieved to announce that once again, marijuana is illegal. [the crowd cheers, and Dr. Doctor takes the mic]"
679,14,3,Dr Doctor,"And another bill has been repealed as well. Because ever since we got rid of KFC, we've seen a great rise in cancer. But today we welcome back KFC, and all the medical benefits it gives us. [the store has been renamed MFC - Medicinal Fried Chicken]"
680,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Well I got to admit, it's a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls. [Sharon folds her arms and looks up and away angrily]"
681,14,3,Sharon Marsh,Yeah. Great.
682,14,3,Randy Marsh,"Aw, Sharon, don't be upset. The doctor made you a souvenir. [reaches into a bag and pulls out a flesh-colored winter coat. Sharon looks at it and grins instantly]"
683,14,3,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, I love it! [puts it on and strikes a few poses]"
684,14,3,Randy Marsh,And when it gets cold it shrinks. [two women approach them]
685,14,3,Woman 4,"Sharon, you got a scrotum coat?"
686,14,3,Sharon Marsh,Yyyup!
687,14,3,Woman 5,Luckyyyyy!
688,14,4,Eric Cartman,I've got more friends than Ky-yle! I've got more friends than Ky-yle!
689,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,How the hell do you have more friends than me?
690,14,4,Eric Cartman,"'Cause people think I'm cool, dude."
691,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"How many friends do you have, Kenny?"
692,14,4,Kenny McCormick,(Sixty two)
693,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,What? How the hell do I only have 37 friends?
694,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[walks in] Aww, are you guys doing that stupid Facebook stuff again?"
695,14,4,Eric Cartman,[retorts] Stupid Facebok stuff.
696,14,4,Stan Marsh,Why are you guys in here wasting your time? We're supposed to be outside playing video games.
697,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Stan, you don't get how cool Facebook has become. You can message your friends, play Yahtzee with your friends, even start your own virtual farm and have your friends visit it."
698,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, who the hell wants to play Yahtzee?"
699,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Stan, we know it's hard to get started, but we have a little surprise for you."
700,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah dude, we made you your own Facebook page. [smiles]"
701,14,4,Eric Cartman,Surprise! [smiles]
702,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Noo, I told you guys I don't wanna be on Facebook!"
703,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but now you can be friends with all of us!"
704,14,4,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah!)
705,14,4,Stan Marsh,I'm not collecting friends and I'm not building any farms! I don't wanna get sucked into this!
706,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Alright, fine dude, you don't have to add any friends. You can just be like Kip Drordy"
707,14,4,Stan Marsh,Who?
708,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Kip Drordy, the third grader? He's got nooo Facebook friends. [begins to gloat] And he's had a profile for more than six months."
709,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Aww gee, that's... so sad. Everyone should have one Facebook friend."
710,14,4,Stan Marsh,You guys are retarded I'm playing Xbox. [turns around and walks out.]
711,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,There's really people out there without a Facebook friend in the world? That's so wrong.
712,14,4,Kip and his parents,"[getting excited] Ahhhhh. [gets off his stool and runs around the room] Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa! Yeah! [opens the door, runs out of his room and down the stairs and into the kitchen]"
713,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Mom, Dad! I made a friend today!"
714,14,4,Kip s Mom,"Kip, really?"
715,14,4,Kip s Dad,You did?
716,14,4,Kip and his parents,Yeah!! [jumps for joy]
717,14,4,Kip s Dad,"Huh son, that's wonderful."
718,14,4,Kip s Mom,What's his name?
719,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Kyle Broflovski! He's a student, and his interests include video games and reading."
720,14,4,Kip s Mom,"Oh, is he a nice boy?"
721,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Oh, he's the best, Mom! He has a green hat, and he wants the world to stop talking about ninjas. Oh! I need to tell him what I'm currently thinking about! What am I currently thinking about?! [runs back to his room]"
722,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Hey Stan, I was on my computer at work and saw that you have a Facebook page now?"
723,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, Dad, I was kinda forced to."
724,14,4,Randy Marsh,Well sooo... are you gonna add me as a friend?
725,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[looks over his shoulder] No- Dad, I I really don't wanna get more into it."
726,14,4,Randy Marsh,"...Oh okay. [walks away, but returns a few seconds later] So I'm, m not your friend then?"
727,14,4,Stan Marsh,"...Dad, you are my friend."
728,14,4,Randy Marsh,"...But you just don't wanna, add me, as a friend?"
729,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Dad it's just a stupid click of a button, it takes two seconds!"
730,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Right, but you don't have... the two seconds orrr?"
731,14,4,Stan Marsh,I just wanna do my homework!
732,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Alright, fine. [walks away again. Stan puts his face in his left palm, then gets back to homework. Randy returns...] Just to be clear, you and I are not... friends?"
733,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Alright, Dad, I'll add you!"
734,14,4,Randy Marsh,Oh cool! Okay. [walks away]
735,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Mom, Dad, my best friend Kyle? He went to the dentist yesterday, and got two fillings! And today he's wondering if Hurt Locker really deserved the Oscar!"
736,14,4,Kip s Mom,"That's great, Kip!"
737,14,4,Kip and his parents,Yeah! [runs off]
738,14,4,Kip s Dad,They sure are getting to know each other.
739,14,4,Kip s Mom,I'ts amazing! You know Kip spent the morning at the boy's farm?
740,14,4,Kip s Dad,His friend lives on a farm?
741,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I think I'll add some more... pigs. [done] Oh, maybe I should put in another field of corn there. [moves his avatar to his corn fields and adds one] There we go. Nice. [a click and a small whoosh are heard, and Kyle looks at his screen. ""You have 29 friends""] Twenty nine? No, I have thirty friends. [a click and a small whoosh are heard. ""You have 28 friends."" More of these sounds are heard as Kyle's friend count drops] Hey what the hell is-? Oh no! Oh shit! [Kyle does what he can, but keeps losing friends]"
742,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,Am I a joke to you?
743,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[stops moving, then turns around] What?"
744,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"I just wanna know, is that all I am? A big joke?"
745,14,4,Stan Marsh,"...Um, no?"
746,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"You DO have a Facebook page, Stan!"
747,14,4,Stan Marsh,Oh Goddamnit no! I just got that because Kyle-
748,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"Yeah well I saw your page, Stan! Relationship status? Single?"
749,14,4,Stan Marsh,Relationship stat- I didn't even pay any attention to that-
750,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"You like being single, Stan? So that you could Facebook to find other girls?! According to your Facebook page, [crosses her arms] we aren't friends!"
751,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Alright, I'll add you as a friend. I'm sorry."
752,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"And you'd BETTER change your relationship status to ""In a relationship""!"
753,14,4,Stan Marsh,How?
754,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"By editing your profile under ""basic information""!"
755,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, I'm sorry!"
756,14,4,Stan Marsh,"""Edit profile. Basic... settings"" Jesus Christ!"
757,14,4,Randy Marsh,Stan? Why won't you be friends with Grandma?
758,14,4,Stan Marsh,"...Aw. Dad, I just really don't wanna pay attention to this thing!"
759,14,4,Randy Marsh,Grandma is in the hospital! And you won't even be friends with her!
760,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Alright, Dad, I'll add Grandma as a friend."
761,14,4,Randy Marsh,"That's better. Oh, and I sent you a funny picture and you didn't respond to it. [walks away]"
762,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, fuck Facebook! Seriously! [an update pops up] What the hell is this?! Podcast?"
763,14,4,Eric Cartman,"[in a video podcast]  Welcome to Cartman's Incredible Podcast! [Mad Friends podcast. Cartman sits behind a Mad Friends desk. At the bottom of the screen are two tickers. The upper one shows changes in friend stocks, the lower one shows Facebook updates] Hello fellow Facebookers, I'm here to do one thing: get you more friends! [rings a bell and leaves his chair] Looking around Facebook today we see that since adding loser Kip Drordy as a friend, Kyle Broflovski's stock is plummeting! He had 55 friends just two days ago, he's down to just 11 this morning. Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don't see him making a comeback any time soon. [presses a big red button, which produces a shotgun blast] You're gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why? [shows a birthday cake] Birthday! That's right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita. [presses a button that produces the sound of a whistle] If you don't have Clyde as a friend, you're gonna want to add him, because Clyde's numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street. [cranks up a player that repeats ""Word On The Street""] The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That's right. Looks like we're about to have a merger [presses a robot that says ""MERGER""] So if you're a friend of Jimmy's you're about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are. That's all the time I have for today. Remember, update that profile, and steer clear of Kyle!"
764,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Can I come in?
765,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Sure dude. [Kyle enters, still sniffling] Dude, what's the matter?"
766,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,I... don't... have... any... friends...
767,14,4,Stan Marsh,What?
768,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I mean, I do, but, well, ever since I became friends with that Kip Drordy kid, a bunch of my other friends have started ignoring me. It would be fine except for my farm is starting to shrink. I know that I should just dump Kip as a friend, but that's such a terrible thing to do and, I'm sorry I'm just so confused I... I really need a friend right now."
769,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay dude, I'm I'm here for you."
770,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"'K, so then get on Facebook and fertilize my crops?"
771,14,4,Stan Marsh,NO.
772,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Pleahehese! My farm hasn't expanded in three days!
773,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I've already had to become friends with all of Wendy's frends and my grandma's friends! I do NOT want to start doing all the farming stuff too! I'm not getting sucked into that!"
774,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[rushes up to Stan, falls on his knees, and grabs the lower part of his friend's jacket] YOU DON'T GET SUCKED INTO IT! YOU DON'T GET SUCKED IN AT ALL! PLEHEHEHEHEHEASE!"
775,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[frustrated] Ah, FUCK."
776,14,4,Stan Marsh,Okay it says I'm at your farm.
777,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"'Kay, so now just click on the little soil button... [Stan does so] and then maybe put a sign up to comment on my farm... [Stan does so] Okay, now I can read the sign you put up..."
778,14,4,Stan Marsh,"'Kay, it says you and I are now very good friends."
779,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. We're very good friends. We're very good friends, Stan!"
780,14,4,Kip s Dad,"So Kip, you spend more time with your buddy Kyle today?"
781,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Oh yeah Dad, we've been havin' the best time! I showed him all the pictures of me and that silly Halloween costume last year."
782,14,4,Kip s Mom,"[joins the boys at the table] Oh, what'd he say about those?"
783,14,4,Kip and his parents,He laughed out loud. And then he was rollin' on the floor laughin'!
784,14,4,Kip s Dad,Sounds like you boys had a ball!
785,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Mom, Dad, I'm all done. Can I go hang out with Kyle and tell him all about what I had for dinner?"
786,14,4,Kip s Dad,"Well it's a little late, but it is Friday."
787,14,4,Kip s Mom,"I think the more time you spend with your little friend, the better."
788,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Wow, thanks! [runs out of the kitchen]"
789,14,4,Kip s Mom,"Have fun and be safe! [Kip runs through the living room and upstairs, then enters his own room]"
790,14,4,Kip and his parents,"Ate a pork chop for dinner. Had nice apple sauce too. [clicks on Share, and there's his status. He waits for a reply, from 7:20 to... 8:30. He gets a reply: Kyle likes the post] Hahaa haha! Yeah! [gets off his chair and dances around] Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
791,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."""
792,14,4,Stan Marsh,What?
793,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,"""I think you look cute in your bunny costume."" What is that supposed to mean?!"
794,14,4,Stan Marsh,...I have no idea.
795,14,4,Wendy Testaburger,That's what Susan92 wrote on your wall! You give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits?! Fuck you! [walks off in anger.]
796,14,4,Stan Marsh,[turns to see her walk off] Susan92 is a friend of my grandma's and she's 92 years old! [turns around and continues on his way. He walks by an electronics store]
797,14,4,Man 1,"[standing in the doorway with a cigarette in his left hand] Oh hey Stan, I'm your friend Brian through your uncle Jimbo? Hey I commented on your status but I haven't heard back from you. Could you give me a poke sometime soon?"
798,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Fine! [continues walking, but a car pulls up next to him.]"
799,14,4,Man 2,"Hey kid, how come you ignored my friend request?"
800,14,4,Stan Marsh,[looks at him like he's crazy] I don't know you!
801,14,4,Man 2,"Yeah, well I'm just a guy that gets ignored, I guess! [spits on Stan and drives off, Stan begins to shake in anger]"
802,14,4,Randy Marsh,Stan? Grandma said she poked you and you haven't sent a poke back.
803,14,4,Stan Marsh,"...Dad, I didn't even wanna do th-"
804,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Stan, poke your grandma!"
805,14,4,Stan Marsh,"[squeezes his eyes shut and stays still for a moment] No. NO! Screw this! You know what? ""Edit Profile > Update Profile."" There! ""Delete Profile""! [reads the popup] ""You have requested to delete your Facebook profile. If this is an error, hit Cancel"" Proceed! [presses ""Proceed,"" then reads the next popup.] ""Delete yor profile, are you sure? Yes. No."" Yes! ""Are you totally sure?"" Yes! [clicks on it and his screen goes black. A blinking amber cursor appears]"
806,14,4,Computer Voice,"[the following words appear onscreen] I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Stan Marsh."
807,14,4,Stan Marsh,You can't let me do that? What are you talking about? [his monitor has a built-in Webcam]
808,14,4,Computer Voice,I'm gonna have to put you on the game grid.
809,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Delete Profile! ""Are you totally sure? Yes or-"" Yes! Goddamnit yes! Delete! Delete delete! [the webcam lights up and shoots a laser at Stan's forehead, knocking him back on his chair. It then sets up boxes of energy around his body] Hey Dad? [the camera begins scanning him in bit by bit, pixel by pixel] Dad? [He disappeared from his chair and he transported through the webcam. He soon appears on a virtual floor after traveling down some tunnels] Oh dude, what the fuck? [Neon lights appear all over]"
810,14,4,Guard 1,"Alright get moving, Profile."
811,14,4,Stan Marsh,Profile? I'm not a profile.
812,14,4,Guard 1,Ignore. [shocks him with an electric prod.]
813,14,4,Stan Marsh,AAH. [The guards escort Stan away]
814,14,4,Profile 1,Tom Davis says hello to Linda Green's profile.
815,14,4,Profile 2,Linda Davis likes how Tom Davis has changed his status.
816,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Excuse me, my name is-"
817,14,4,Profile 3,Ignore.
818,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Eh hey, could you tell me how I-"
819,14,4,Profile 4,Ignore.
820,14,4,Stan Marsh,[realizes where he is] Aw Goddamnit I got sucked into Facebook!
821,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know what to do. I just can't seem to get my friend numbers to go up. I'm desperate. That's why I came to you.
822,14,4,Eric Cartman,"You're very smart, Kyle. But the truth is, as long as you have that Kip Drordy loser as a Facebook friend, people view your friendship as a liability. You gotta dump him."
823,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I can't do that, I'd just feel too bad."
824,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Well Kyle, then what you have to do is go outside the normal circles and try to make friends with people who've never heard of Kip."
825,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,I've been trying! But I just don't know how to make totally new friends on the Internet.
826,14,4,Eric Cartman,"It's not as hard as it sounds, Kyle. Have you ever heard of chatroulette?"
827,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,No. What's chatroulette?
828,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Yep, finding new friends is easier today than ever before. We just set ourselves up on webcam, and then the computer will randomly put us with one of the fifty thousand people online also doing chatroulette."
829,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, uh that's, that's kinda cool."
830,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Uh huh. Alright, let's see who our first chat partner is. Connect."
831,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[a look of disgust comes over him] Aww, that's some dude jacking off! [turns away quickly]"
832,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, you get those sometimes. We'll just click to the next person. There we go. Hello?"
833,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,That's just a guy's penis too!
834,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay let's, let's try this one."
835,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns away quickly] Dude, I don't wanna see a bunch of guys' penises!"
836,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Hold on, Kyle! This is seriously an amazing gathering place where people from all over the world can share their thoughts and ideas. [goes onto the next person] Okay, that's a dude jacking off, but... 'Kay, dude jacking off... Penis... Penis... Penis penis penis. Ah! Here's a guy! Hey dude, how's it going?"
837,14,4,Dude,[waves] Hey.
838,14,4,Eric Cartman,This is my friend Kyle. He's looking for some new friends.
839,14,4,Dude,"Oh yeah? [leaves his chair and goes to the other end of his room, turns around, unzips his pants]"
840,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Ohh, he's taking out his penis. Okay, next guy..."
841,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, screw this! I don't wanna see anymore!"
842,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, this is the way the world works! If you wanna find some quality friends, you've gotta wade through all the dicks first!"
843,14,4,Stan Marsh,Excuse me. Could you tell me what the hell's going on?
844,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis","No, you aren't my friend. Would you like to be my friend?"
845,14,4,Stan Marsh,"No, I seriously don't want any more friends."
846,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis","Ignore. [turns to talk to another profile] So anyway, I really like taking long walks in the summer, you know, because there's like"
847,14,4,Stan Marsh,Okay I'll be your friend.
848,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis","[turns back to Stan] Confirm. [both of them feel a surge of energy in their game suits, shown by the suits lighting up, then it disappears] Oooo, Tom Davis is thrilled to have become powerful by adding a new friend. Here are some pictures of my dog. And here he is in some silly outfits. Can you comment on these?"
849,14,4,Stan Marsh,Awww!
850,14,4,Guard,"[comes up behind Stan] Move it, profile!"
851,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis",Oh oh.
852,14,4,Stan Marsh,Why oh oh?
853,14,4,Profile 5,They're taking him to the gaming arena.
854,14,4,"Various Profiles, including one for Tom Davis","Looks like I'm gonna be down a friend. [the guards escort Stan to the arena, shocking him once in a while. Another profile appears next to him]"
855,14,4,Referee,"You are about to face each other in combat! You will play the game for the amusement of the users! [the arena is activated and Stan and the other profile are sent in] Let the game commence! [they face each other and virtual bikes pop up under them, lifting them off the floor. The bikes are replaced with a table and two stools and a guard brings a game of Yahtzee to the table.]"
856,14,4,Stan Marsh,Yahtzee?
857,14,4,Referee,"One round only! Begin! [the opposing profile rolls first, leaves a pair of 3s and scoops up three dice, rolls again]"
858,14,4,Profile 6,"Uhhh, I'm gonna count five in my five box."
859,14,4,Stan Marsh,Can't we play on speeder bikes or something?
860,14,4,Guard,"[shocks him] Play, profile!"
861,14,4,Stan Marsh,[rolls and gets five 4s] Yahtzee. [the other profile gasps and vanishes in a fair bit of pain]
862,14,4,Eric Cartman,Dude jacking off... Dude jacking off... [coughs to clear his throat] That's a dude jacking off...
863,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"That's it Cartman, I'm outta here! [walks to the bedroom door] Chatroulette is no way for me to find new friends! [about to open the door]"
864,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Waitwait wait wait, wait Kyle! [Kyle turns and goes back to Cartman's desk.] Here's a nice little Jewish kid. Hey, hi there."
865,14,4,Boy,Hello.
866,14,4,Eric Cartman,"Yeah hey, nice to meet you. My friend Kyle is a Jew too."
867,14,4,Boy,Oh that's cool. I was startin' to think this was nothin' but dudes jackin' off.
868,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, so... do you wanna be Facebook friends?"
869,14,4,Boy,"Uhh, sure. If you'll come and visit my farm."
870,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Heck yeah I'll visit your farm! You should check mine out too!
871,14,4,Kip s Dad,"Honey, where's Kip? I haven't seen him all day."
872,14,4,Kip s Mom,"No, he's been out spending the whole day with his best friend Kyle. I think they're at the movies now."
873,14,4,Referee,Troublemaker! You were not supposed to survive the game of Yahtzee! You have made things complicated!
874,14,4,Stan Marsh,I've made them complicated?! I don't even wanna be here!
875,14,4,Referee,That's not what your profile said.
876,14,4,Stan Marsh,My profile? Goddamnit my Facebook profile has taken on a life of its own! Where is it?!
877,14,4,Referee,Your profile is one of the most powerful in all of Facebook. You cannot stop it now.
878,14,4,Stan Marsh,Oh yeah? I can try! [turns around and walks through a wall]
879,14,4,Referee,After him!
880,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, I fed the pigs. Now I definitely should water some fields... Oh wow, cool. That Jewish kid put up a sign on my farm. ""Hey Kyle, really like your farm."" Oh awesome! [a new sound is heard] What the hell is that? Stan? [Stan appears on Kyle's farm and walks to the middle of the screen]"
881,14,4,Stan Marsh,"You're an asshole, Kyle!"
882,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,[perplexed] ...What?
883,14,4,Stan Marsh,What's the one thing I told you?! That I didn't wanna get sucked into Facebook! This is all your fault!
884,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks around making sure the coast is clear] Dude, w-what are you doing?"
885,14,4,Stan Marsh,What's it look like I'm doing?! I found your farm in Facebook so you can help me deal with this bullshit! You've gotta go check out my profile status!
886,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Profile status?
887,14,4,Stan Marsh,Just bring up my Facebook page and see what it says my status is!
888,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, Stan I have to harvest my crops before it's too late."
889,14,4,Stan Marsh,Dude! Fuck your crops! [walks up to Kyle's corn and starts ripping the stalks up]
890,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Dude! Dude okay! Stop! I'm sorry! [pulls up Stan's status] Says that you are currently... hosting an online chat party for all your friends.
891,14,4,Stan Marsh,Where?
892,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,Café World.
893,14,4,Stan Marsh,Son of a bitch! [runs back to the barn he came out of]
894,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"An online chat party for all his friends... Dude, I should get over there!"
895,14,4,Stan Marsh,Jesus Christ.
896,14,4,Randy s profile,Randy Marsh is at work right now. Work is boring.
897,14,4,Butters profile,Butters Stotch is enjoying Stan's chat party.
898,14,4,Garrison s profile,Herbert Garrison likes Butters' comment.
899,14,4,Grandma Marsh s profile,Grandma Marsh would like to be friends with Kevin Donahue.
900,14,4,Kevin Donahue s profile,Kevin Donahue accept's Grandma Marsh's friendship.
901,14,4,Stan Marsh,Has anybody seen my stupid profile?!
902,14,4,Susan92 s profile,Susan92 has pictures of Stan in a bunny costume.
903,14,4,Gary Johnson s profile,Gary Johnson thinks the pictures are fantastic!
904,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, there's a lot of profiles here. Kyle Broflovski's amazed Stan has so many Facebook friends. Hey, Kyle Broflovski's amazed Isiah is also a Facebook friend of Stan's."
905,14,4,Isiah,Isiah's order is on leaving Kyle Broflovski as a friend.
906,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,What? Why?
907,14,4,Isiah,"User saw you were friends with Kip Drordy, who only has one friend. Kyle Broflovski is bad friend stock."
908,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh n-no, I'm not really friends with him."
909,14,4,Isiah,Ignore.
910,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Unh, that does it!"
911,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Alright alright, enough! Everybody just shut up! [everyone shuts up and looks at him] Where is profile Stan Marsh! [the room begins to rumble]"
912,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,[rising from the ground] Right here.
913,14,4,Stan Marsh,Oh...
914,14,4,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm sorry, Kip, but I really can't be your friend anymore. It was a great ride, but I must say goodbye. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but ending a friendship... is never easy. [moves the cursor to the Send button and clicks it. With the message sent, Kyle moves the cursor to the left side of the screen and selects ""Remove from Friends,"" and clicks that. A popup window shows up: ""Kip Drordy - Remove from Friends?"" He clicks on ""Remove from Friends"" and Facebook tells him his friend is removed.]"
915,14,4,Stan Marsh,"What do you want from me, dude?!"
916,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"I'm your profile, and as you can see, I am much more powerful than you."
917,14,4,Stan Marsh,Damnit I should have deleted you a long time ago!
918,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,Why do you think I brought you in here? The fact of the matter is I'm up and running now with almost a million friends. I don't need you anymore. I have more friends than you'll ever have in the real world.
919,14,4,Stan Marsh,Who cares? Friends shouldn't be some kind of... commodity for a person's status!
920,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,Who is more powerful? The user or the profile? Let's end this once and for all. [the Yahtzee platform appears under them]
921,14,4,Referee,"Let the final battle begin! [the crowd drops down, or the platform rises. Hard to tell. The table and two stools appear and a guard brings the Yahtzee board game over]"
922,14,4,Stan Marsh,Fuckin' Yahtzee again? Seriously? [his giant profile takes a seat and rolls the dice]
923,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"What did I tell you?! That's a large flush already! You don't have a chance in here, user! You pathetic little-"
924,14,4,Stan Marsh,Yahtzee.
925,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,What?!
926,14,4,Stan Marsh,Yahtzee. Sixes.
927,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,No. Can't be.
928,14,4,Randy Marsh,Yahtzee!
929,14,4,Profile Stan Marsh,"No! Ahhhhh! [vanishes in a fair bit of pain. After some silence, Stan disappears from the arena and is reassembled back on his chair at home]"
930,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Awgh! [catches his breath. With his profile destroyed, Stan sees that he has 0 friends.] Oh thank God."
931,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Hey Stan, my computer says we're not friends anymore?"
932,14,4,Stan Marsh,"My Facebook profile went rogue, Dad. I had to go into the circuitry and do battle with it. I sent all my friends somewhere else."
933,14,4,Randy Marsh,"Oh okay. So we're, we're not friends, then?"
934,14,4,Stan Marsh,"Fuck off, Dad. [turns off the monitor and leaves his desk.]"
935,14,5,Tour Guide,"Our factory works 24/7 to produce candy, and we have over 500 employees. Here you can see where the cocoa is mixed with the sugar and milk."
936,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Wow, coo'.. [snaps a picture] Chocolate rules!"
937,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,"You should know, fatass."
938,14,5,Eric Cartman,"AY! I'm not fat, you sneaky Jew!"
939,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Oh God, you guys, really? This again? [the students all move to the next spot in the tour]"
940,14,5,Tour Guide,And here is where all the fudge is put into boxes to be shipped all over the world.
941,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,Kinda like Cartman's dad shipped out on him.
942,14,5,Eric Cartman,"I have a dad, butthole. My mom is my dad."
943,14,5,Stan Marsh,"You guys stop! All you're doing is rehashing a bunch of old stuff! [everyone moves on except Butters, who spots something]"
944,14,5,Butters Stotch,"Hey Stan, isn't that Tom Cruise?"
945,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Huh? [Tom Cruise is packing fudge into boxes with a hat pulled low over his face] Oh wow it is! Hey guys check it out, Tom Cruise is a fudge packer!"
946,14,5,Tom Cruise,What did you call me?
947,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Hey, that is Tom Cruise! [snaps a picture]"
948,14,5,Butters Stotch,"How come you're packin' fudge, Mr. Cruise?"
949,14,5,Tom Cruise,I'm not a fudge packer!
950,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you don't have to be ashamed or anything."
951,14,5,Tom Cruise,But I'm not a fudge packer! [packs a block of fudge into a box]
952,14,5,Stan Marsh,Then why are you packing fudge?
953,14,5,Tom Cruise,I'm not. I am a very busy actor who is trying to get away for a week and do some fly fishing! [pushes more fudge into boxes]
954,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you are in a fudge factory packing fudge."
955,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh, that does it. I will SUE you!"
956,14,5,Stan Marsh,For what?
957,14,5,Tom Cruise,You can't just call somebody a fudge packer and get away with it! [Mr. Garrison walks over]
958,14,5,Mr Garrison,"Hey, is that fudge-packer Tom Cruise?"
959,14,5,Tom Cruise,That's it! [throws his hat away] I'm suing this entire intolerant town!
960,14,5,Stan Marsh,But dude-
961,14,5,Tom Cruise,"No buts! If you want to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker, you're gonna pay the consequences!"
962,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Guys, I want to really thank you all for coming. Shockingly, I've just been slandered once again in the town of South Park, something I know you can all relate to. [all celebrities nod and agree]"
963,14,5,Tiger Woods,That town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies!
964,14,5,Bono,I'm fed up with it. That town suggested that I was made of shit!
965,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Yeah, well I was just over there doing a little fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer! [The celebrities all are shocked and appealed] I know, right? And then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in. [Sally Struthers is taking up the whole couch, except for the small place of an annoyed Mickey Mouse.]"
966,14,5,Sally Struthers,"South Park, Colorado, is the most racist, insensitive, and bigoted place in this country! [George Lucas holding onto a ball-gagged Indiana Jones]"
967,14,5,George Lucas,That place thinks they can say whatever they want about us and get away with it!
968,14,5,Paris Hilton,"If anyone has a gripe against that shithole, it's me! [coughs up some semen, then rubs it on John Travolta's crotch]"
969,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Yeah, well I say enough. All of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all! No longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want."
970,14,5,All Celebrities,YEAH!
971,14,5,Jared Fogle,"Hey, Tom. I ate too much Subway. Where's your bathroom?"
972,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh, just the door down the hall there, Jared. [Jared opens the door to find a closet] No, no, no, that's a closet. Go down more. [Jared opens another door, which is also a closet.] No that's a closet too. [Jared opens a door, and once again it is a closet] Nope, Jared. That's a closet too. [Jared opens another door, it is another closet] No. [Jared opens two more doors, both closets] That's a closet... No that- that's a closet too."
973,14,5,Principal Victoria,"[over the PA system] Stan Marsh, to the principal's office. Stan Marsh to the principal's office immediately!"
974,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, what did you do?"
975,14,5,Stan Marsh,I have no idea...
976,14,5,Randy Marsh,"You just had to push it, didn't you Stan. You just had to make fun of Tom Cruise again!"
977,14,5,Principal Victoria,Did you call him a fudge packer?
978,14,5,Stan Marsh,Aww... he was packing fudge!
979,14,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Little boy, you don't understand how serious this is. Tom Cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit, along with 200 other celebrities!"
980,14,5,Mr Mackey,"They are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town, m'kay!"
981,14,5,Stan Marsh,"It wasn't just me. Other kids called him a fudge packer, even Mr. Gar-"
982,14,5,Principal Victoria,"But you started it. Mr. Broflovski, tell him what you told us."
983,14,5,Gerald Broflovski,"Stan, a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town. We can't possibly go up against their lawyers!"
984,14,5,Sgt Yates,"Dammit Marsh, why couldn't you have just kept your stupid ugly son in line!"
985,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Hey, don't start blaming me for his looks!"
986,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Cruise. My son is so, so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments."
987,14,5,Tom Cruise,That's nice! [punches the button to take away fudge he just packed] I'm still suing you all! Nobody calls me a fudge packer! [pushes fudge into a box]
988,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Yes, it was a terrible mistake. But maybe you could see how, since you do... take fudge and... pack it into a box... [Tom Cruise turns around]"
989,14,5,Tom Cruise,WHAT?
990,14,5,Randy Marsh,"We-, I-I'm just saying that you are employed currently as a person who... packages..."
991,14,5,Tom Cruise,I am an actor. I do not pack fudge! [turns around and throws a piece of fudge into a box angrily]
992,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Right, my son just got confused. Because you have a little uniform, and a... hat that says ""Fred's Fudge and Candies""... and you are... Look it doesn't matter. Just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit. Nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer ever again. [Tom Cruise sighs and backs away from his fudge packing station]"
993,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Well, there is... one thing that your town could do to... maybe make me forget about this lawsuit."
994,14,5,Randy Marsh,ANYTHING! anything you want Mr. Cruise.
995,14,5,Tom Cruise,It's just that there's somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-
996,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Sure! Who is it, we can get anybody for you."
997,14,5,Tom Cruise,Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.
998,14,5,Stan Marsh,Ooooooo...
999,14,5,Randy Marsh,That's... tricky...
1000,14,5,Tom Cruise,Well then you can just get sued! [Returns to packing fudge]
1001,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-"
1002,14,5,Tom Cruise,No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear or your little town is DONE!
1003,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Okay people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park."
1004,14,5,Mr Garrison,"Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! [audience shouts in agreement]"
1005,14,5,Stephen Stotch,Now we don't know that. Maybe enough time has passed that it is now OK to show Muhammad in public.
1006,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,"[to Token] Dude, I can't believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again."
1007,14,5,Mr Mackey,"But even if it were safe for Muhammad to be shown, how would we ever find him?"
1008,14,5,Sgt Yates,"Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. [shows the whole audience. Stan in the middle raises his hand]"
1009,14,5,Stan Marsh,I saw him once. [everyone turns towards Stan]
1010,14,5,Mayor McDaniels,[steps forward] You did?
1011,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, one time, my friends joined David Blaine's cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, and Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends."
1012,14,5,Mr Garrison,"Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?"
1013,14,5,Stan Marsh,"No, dude, it was totally fine."
1014,14,5,Sgt Yates,Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?
1015,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln..."
1016,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Alright Stan, that's enough. Jesus, can't learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I have done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. [holds up a file and begins to open it]"
1017,14,5,Mr Garrison,"No, don't! [Randy holds it up to reveal a poorly drawn stick figure] Is that okay to show?"
1018,14,5,Jimbo Kern,I don't know. I guess we'll see.
1019,14,5,Hillary Clinton,"Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn't make sense!"
1020,14,5,Jesse Jackson,"Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park."
1021,14,5,Tom Cruise,"No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?"
1022,14,5,Oprah Winfrey,You want Muhammad because he can't be ridiculed?
1023,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power? [moves over to Jimmy Buffet] Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if no-one could ever call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage?"
1024,14,5,Jimmy Buffett,I... I'd love it!
1025,14,5,Tom Cruise,"By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule. [walks to the bar next to Tim Burton] Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you've made lately. There'd never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since Beetlejuice. And, you put Johnny Depp and all the same crappy music in every film. And if you're that in love with Johnny Depp, then you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!"
1026,14,5,Tim Burton,"Gee, that'd be swell."
1027,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take that power from him. [Cartman walks in]"
1028,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Excuse me... [the celebrities turn around] This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?"
1029,14,5,Tom Cruise,Hey! It's one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!
1030,14,5,Eric Cartman,I didn't come for myself. I just came as an escort for another celebrity who wants in on your lawsuit...
1031,14,5,Michael Richards,"Who? [Cartman lifts up his hand and takes off his glove, revealing fake hair and painted on lips. It is Jennifer Lopez.]"
1032,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,Alllloooo... [celebrities gasp]
1033,14,5,Tom Cruise,Jennifer Lopez! [celebrities crowd around saying hellos to Jennifer]
1034,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Yes, I am Hennifer Lopez, and I like tacos and burritos."
1035,14,5,Narrator,"In the great hall of the Super Best Friends, there are assembled the leaders of the world's greatest religions; Jesus! [Jesus smiles and hammers a wood board] Buddha! [Buddha pries apart the screen] Krishna! [Krishna snaps his fingers and becomes a beaver] Muhammad! [Muhammad is walking down a street, but he has been replaced with a giant bar reading CENSORED] Lao Tzu and Joseph Smith [Walking down a corridor like the opening of Scooby Doo] and... the mighty Semen! [The word ""Seaman"" appears on the screen, but he says semen]"
1036,14,5,Seaman,"It's not semen, it's Seaman!"
1037,14,5,Narrator,"[covering up a laugh] Their mission; right that which is wrong, and to serve all mankind."
1038,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, all we are asking you to do is bring Muhammad to our town for like an hour."
1039,14,5,Jesus Christ,"My son, much has changed since you were last here. Muhammad cannot make public appearances."
1040,14,5,Buddha,We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people
1041,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!"
1042,14,5,Narrator,Back in the hall of the Super Best Friends...
1043,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?"
1044,14,5,Joseph Smith,"No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face."
1045,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?
1046,14,5,Lao Tzu,"No, cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble."
1047,14,5,Stan Marsh,Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can't see anything.
1048,14,5,Jesus Christ,But it's still Muhammad walking around in human form.
1049,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,Aww come on! This is ridiculous! [pounds hands on table]
1050,14,5,Joseph Smith,"Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure. [snorting noise, Buddha is snorting cocaine]"
1051,14,5,Jesus Christ,"Buddha, don't do coke in front of kids! [Kyle and Stan stare open mouthed for a second]"
1052,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,"A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?"
1053,14,5,Joseph Smith,But he's talking from the U-Haul?
1054,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Well yeah, he's got to talk or nobody knows he's in there!"
1055,14,5,Jesus Christ,"Hearing his voice, I don't know. What do you think Moses? [Moses is floating over in the previously unseen corner]"
1056,14,5,Moses,Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?
1057,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,There doesn't have to be...
1058,14,5,Moses,Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.
1059,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of."
1060,14,5,Russel Crowe,"Tom, Tom, you're talkin' crazy mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him? [Rob Reiner walks in with a huge sandwich and handkerchief]"
1061,14,5,Rob Reiner,"We take his goo! It's as simple as that friends. [takes a bite and wipes forehead, then walks over near Tom Cruise]"
1062,14,5,Tom Cruise,Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.
1063,14,5,Rob Reiner,"Any goo can be harvested from a person's body, and easily placed into another. [wipes forehead, holds up his hand, but speaks to himself]"
1064,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Wait, wait, wait, you mean we aren't going to sue and get a bunch of money?"
1065,14,5,Tom Cruise,"No Jen, we all have got enough money."
1066,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad's goo! Yes, yes, ariva ariva!"
1067,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Uh, excuse us for a second... [walks away]"
1068,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Alright, just what the hell do you think you are doing?"
1069,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"What am I doing? Just having some fun, cholo!"
1070,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Cut the crap, I thought we were here for lawsuit money!"
1071,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Just keep your mouth shut, and do what I tell you!"
1072,14,5,Eric Cartman,"If we are staying here, then I want to know what is going on. Don't forget, I know who you really are... [looks at his hand, then removes his hand's hairpiece] Mitch Conner."
1073,14,5,Mitch Conner,"If you know what's good for you, you'll keep your mouth shut, kid."
1074,14,5,Eric Cartman,"You're a no-good swindler and a 2-bit thief. We were here for money, not goo!"
1075,14,5,Mitch Conner,Think about it. Muhammad is the only person in the world who can't get ripped on. Those celebrities want his goo.
1076,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, so what?"
1077,14,5,Mitch Conner,"You know what the goo is worth on the open market? Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who'll give me 50 mil for that goo."
1078,14,5,Eric Cartman,"So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves."
1079,14,5,Mitch Conner,You catch on quick kid... [knock at the door]
1080,14,5,Tom Cruise,[from the other side of the door] Mrs. Lopez...
1081,14,5,Mitch Conner,"Hurry, get my wig back on! [Tom opens the door]"
1082,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god [scratches the back of his head guiltily] you found my fudge packing uniform..."
1083,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!"
1084,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you. You really did bring us Muhammad."
1085,14,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Thank you so much for coming, Muhammad. [steps forward toward Muhammad, who is in a giant U-Haul]"
1086,14,5,Muhammad,[in a small voice] Welcome.
1087,14,5,Mr Garrison,"Oh, is that okay?"
1088,14,5,Jimbo Kern,I don't know.
1089,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Alright, now we just need to figure out how to get Muhammad from the back of the truck into Tom Cruise's limo."
1090,14,5,Stan Marsh,"What! No, dad. we promised the Super Best Friends that Muhammad would stay in the truck."
1091,14,5,Gerald Broflovski,Cruise's lawyers were very specific boys. He's sending a limo for Muhammad to meet him outside of town.
1092,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,But Muhammad can't be seen dad.
1093,14,5,Sgt Yates,"Alright, we'll put a sheet over him."
1094,14,5,Stan Marsh,"No, you can't even show his feet."
1095,14,5,Sheila Broflovski,How about a Halloween costume with one of those plastic masks?
1096,14,5,Mr Garrison,"No, you could still see his eyes..."
1097,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Okay. How 'bout like... like a big mascot outfit? One that covered him completely, head to toe, without even showing his eyes? [Mayor walks over to U-Haul and shouts inside]"
1098,14,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Muhammad, would that be OK?"
1099,14,5,Muhammad,[still small voice] OK.
1100,14,5,Hillary Clinton,"Tom, Rob, we've just received word from the lawyers. South Park is saying they have Muhammad for us! [celebrities gasp]"
1101,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Rob, will the machine be ready?"
1102,14,5,Rob Reiner,"Oh, it'll be ready! [hits buttons on the machine's control panel]"
1103,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,[out of view] More tacos!
1104,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"[in-view, the celebrities all turn around to look] More tacos!"
1105,14,5,Eric Cartman,No! No more tacos Mrs. Lopez.
1106,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,More tacos.
1107,14,5,Eric Cartman,You just had seven tacos.
1108,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,I want more tacos! [Cartman gives a nervous laugh]
1109,14,5,Eric Cartman,I'm sorry [whisper] Why are you doing this?
1110,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"I am Jennifer Lopez, I need tacos to live!"
1111,14,5,Eric Cartman,"[whispering] You know goddamn well you are not Jennifer Lopez, so stop pissing me off! [Charlie Sheen steps forward]"
1112,14,5,Charlie Sheen,"Mrs. Lopez, I can go. What do you want, like three tacos?"
1113,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Oh, thank you 'harlie Sheeeeen. And maybe an enchirito too?"
1114,14,5,Eric Cartman,Aw- Jee-. They don't even make enchiritos anymore!
1115,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,Yes they do!
1116,14,5,Eric Cartman,I tried getting one last week!
1117,14,5,Jennifer Lopez,"Not all Taco Bells have enchiritos, but some still carry them."
1118,14,5,Eric Cartman,"God, will somebody shut her up?"
1119,14,5,Randy Marsh,"[facing away from view] Alright, the limo's here. Muhammad, thanks again for doing this. [A giant bear costume has been thrown over Muhammad]"
1120,14,5,Mayor McDaniels,You've done this town a huge favor Muhammad. [walks towards the limo]
1121,14,5,Mr Garrison,[from a distance away] Hold on a second! [runs over to the mayor]
1122,14,5,Mr Garrison,"Stop! There's some extremists, threatening that if we give Muhammad to the celebrities, they're gonna bomb us!"
1123,14,5,Mayor McDaniels,What?!
1124,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Aw. Aw it's just a stupid threat! Come on, we don't wanna piss off Tom Cruise again. [starts walking to the limo]"
1125,14,5,Jared Fogle,"[On a walkie-talkie] Alright, we got him Tom. [Everyone outside walks toward the limo, when it suddenly explodes]"
1126,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Muhammad, are you okay? [Runs toward Muhammad and helps him up]"
1127,14,5,Randy Marsh,What the hell was that?!
1128,14,5,Sgt Yates,Obviously the terrorists are for real! [notices a paper Garrison is holding] What does that paper say? [reads the paper aloud] We have placed bombs all over your city. You will give Muhammad to us. The celebrities want Muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed. We want that power... huzzah.
1129,14,5,Stan Marsh,They want his power?
1130,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,What kind of extremists are these? [Yates looks over the note]
1131,14,5,Sgt Yates,You won't believe it...
1132,14,5,Lead Ginger,"Our time is near! Soon, gingers will never be made fun of again!"
1133,14,5,All Gingers,[in unison] Huzzah!
1134,14,5,Mitch Conner,Where the hell do you think you're going?
1135,14,5,Eric Cartman,"I'm through with your stupid plans, Conner! I've got better things to do with my time. [Mitch goes in front of Cartman]"
1136,14,5,Mitch Conner,You gonna walk away from 50 mil? [Cartman stops]
1137,14,5,Eric Cartman,Let me by...
1138,14,5,Mitch Conner,"You walk away now, and you will regret it the rest of your life."
1139,14,5,Eric Cartman,Screw this Conner. [pushes his hand away and moves on] Find yourself another partner.
1140,14,5,Mitch Conner,Then I guess I won't tell you about your father. [Cartman stops]
1141,14,5,Eric Cartman,My father...
1142,14,5,Mitch Conner,"Thought that might get your attention. You know nothing about your dad, right?"
1143,14,5,Eric Cartman,"I know enough, my mother is a hermaphrodite, so she is actually my father."
1144,14,5,Mitch Conner,"You really still believe that garbage? The people in your town sold you that line. Come on, you've had to have doubted it all along. [Cartman turns around to face Conner]"
1145,14,5,Eric Cartman,How could you know anything about who my family is?
1146,14,5,Mitch Conner,"Heh. I know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town. You got lied to kid. By the people who were closest to you. I can prove it too, but I'm going to want something in return."
1147,14,5,Eric Cartman,"If you're making this up to keep me around Conner, the you'd better-"
1148,14,5,Mitch,"You just take me where I tell you, and when you learn the truth, you will learn to trust me. And nobody else..."
1149,14,5,Officer Barbrady,"Okay people, let's try to evacuate in an orderly fashion. Geez."
1150,14,5,Sgt Yates,"Mayor, we do not have the resources to deal with this situation! A full evacuation is impossible!"
1151,14,5,Mayor McDaniels,"Jesus, what are we supposed to do?!"
1152,14,5,Jimbo Kern,We have to give in to their demands.
1153,14,5,Mayor McDaniels,"I'm sorry Muhammad, but we are going to have to give you over the gingers."
1154,14,5,Kyle Broflovski,We can't give him over to the gingers!
1155,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we said we'd take care of him."
1156,14,5,Gerald Broflovski,But our homes and our lives are at stake.
1157,14,5,Stan Marsh,We made a promise... to Jesus! [Randy steps forward]
1158,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Stan, Jesus doesn't matter when Muhammad is involved. [phone rings, everyone turns to look at it]"
1159,14,5,Jimbo Kern,That'll be Tom Cruise... [Randy steps forward and slowly picks it up]
1160,14,5,Randy Marsh,Helllo?
1161,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Yeah, so whats going on?"
1162,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Uh... I'm afraid we can't... well, we can't give Muhammad to you."
1163,14,5,Tom Cruise,"What do you mean, you're not givin' him to us?!"
1164,14,5,Randy Marsh,"There are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we don't give Muhammad to them, they are going to bomb us."
1165,14,5,Tom Cruise,Gingers?
1166,14,5,Kanye West,"Gingers? Aww, hell no."
1167,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Please, understand that we have no choice here Mr. Cruise."
1168,14,5,Tom Cruise,"You're going to give Muhammad to gingers instead of us, just because they are threatening you with violence?"
1169,14,5,Randy Marsh,"Well, yeah."
1170,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh, we can play that game too! You want to see violence, well you got it! [throws the phone at the ground and walks away]"
1171,14,5,Tom Cruise,"[pacing around and fuming] Goddamn stupid assholes! You want to play rough?! OK! Spielburg, go and get some automatic rifles! We'll go in there, and we're going to take [around here, he jumps up and down on the couch, shouting his idea, with Oprah on the other cushion] Muhammad by force! And then we are going to show them th- [Rob Reiner rushes up]"
1172,14,5,Rob Reiner,"Tom, Tom. We can't be seen getting violent."
1173,14,5,Hillary Clinton,"Yeah, that would kill all our careers!"
1174,14,5,Tom Cruise,[still jumping up and down on the couch] But the only way we are going to get Muhammad from South Park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers!
1175,14,5,Rob Reiner,"Fine, then let's have Her do it."
1176,14,5,Tom Cruise,[stops jumping] Her who?
1177,14,5,Rob Reiner,[whisper] You know... Her.
1178,14,5,Tom Cruise,Oh right... [Whispers] Her.
1179,14,5,Rob Reiner,There she is Tom... Barbra Streisand.
1180,14,5,Robert Redford,"My God, she's even more terrifying than I remember."
1181,14,5,Steven Spielberg,"Tom, Barbra Streisand hasn't been active for a long time. Are we sure we want to do this?"
1182,14,5,Tom Cruise,Mrs. Streisand got torn apart in the town of South Park. She's probably more angry at that town than any of us.
1183,14,5,Rob Reiner,"Power her up! Release the Kraken! [Mel Gibson pushes a button, then flips a switch, starting up Mecha-Streisand]"
1184,14,5,Rob Reiner,"[extremely casual voice] Hey Barbra. It's me, Rob Reiner. [Barbra kneels down and blows steam out of her nose, the celebrities shield their faces]"
1185,14,5,Rob Reiner,"Listen, Babs, we are taking on the town of South Park and we really need your help"
1186,14,5,Tom Cruise,"We figured you're pissed at South Park too, right Mrs. Streisand? [Barbra roars, turns around, and slashes the holding tower with her arm saw]"
1187,14,5,Tom Cruise,"Oh, she's pissed all right."
1188,14,5,Mr Garrison,"Eric, what are you doing here?"
1189,14,5,Eric Cartman,"Did you all lie to me? All of you, in that room, when you told me my mother was my father?"
1190,14,5,Mr Garrison,"What? N-No Eric, are you still worried about that old issue, I mean-"
1191,14,5,Eric Cartman,I don't trust you. I want to talk to Mr. Hat.
1192,14,5,Mr Garrison,"Eric, I haven't used Mr. Hat in a long time, and-"
1193,14,5,Eric Cartman,I said GET. Mr. Hat!
1194,14,5,Eric Cartman,Put it on! [he puts it on] Do the voice.
1195,14,5,Mr Hat,"Hello kids, it's me, Mr. Hat. [Cartman pulls his hand from behind his back, revealing Mitch.]"
1196,14,5,Mitch Conner,"Good to see you Hat. Helluva night, isn't it?"
1197,14,5,Mr Hat,I... I don't believe I know you.
1198,14,5,Mitch Conner,"The name's Mitch Conner, I flew the same division as you back in Saigon. [Mr. Garrison lowers Mr. Hat]"
1199,14,5,Mr Garrison,"Eric, this is silly, why don't we just stop-"
1200,14,5,Eric Cartman,Keep... your hand... UP!
1201,14,5,Randy Marsh,"[shouting to the other side of the street] Alright gingers, we have Muhammad for you, now hand over the detonators. [huge group of gingers, all holding detonators]"
1202,14,5,Lead Ginger,"Nuh uh, first you gotta prove that that is still Muhammad in there! Have him step out of the bear costume..."
1203,14,5,Townspeople,Ohhhhhhh...
1204,14,5,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we can't do that"
1205,14,5,Lead Ginger,Show us it's Muhammad or South Park is finished!
1206,14,5,Mr Hat,"Dammit Mitch, you're asking questions that shouldn't be answered!"
1207,14,5,Mitch Conner,So you admit it. There was a cover up. [Mr. Garrison turns away]
1208,14,5,Mr Garrison,"No Mr. Hat, don't say any more!"
1209,14,5,Mitch,"Yeah, tell 'im whatcha know!"
1210,14,5,Mr. Garrison,"Alright Eric, your father was in the room the day of your DNA test, but the results were... tampered with."
1211,14,5,Eric Cartman,"By who? Goddammit Garrison, who is my father?"
1212,14,6,Mitch Conner,"Saigon. It's a hell of a place. I've seen a lot of death. [Vietnamese and American soldiers fire at each other] A lot of suffering. Darkness that most people couldn't stand to see. [Wounded American soldiers are carried back to the helicopters] I tried to sit it out as much as I could. [a left arm exactly like Cartman's is shown. It wears dog tags, a tiny helmet, and camouflage face paint]"
1213,14,6,Soldier 1,"What's the matter, Conner? You don't like a little blood?"
1214,14,6,Mitch Conner,"No, I don't like a little blood. Blood ain't the stuff for eighteen year old boys from Sheboygan. Blood ain't the stuff... for Mitch Conner."
1215,14,6,Soldier 2,"Incoming! [An RPG flies into the helicopter and blows up. Cut to a MASH unit, where Mitch opens his eyes]"
1216,14,6,Army Doctor,"Conner, Mitchell. You're discharged, son."
1217,14,6,Mitch Conner,"And that's that. ""Pack your bags, you're headed home. Hugs and kisses from Uncle Sam."" [cut to the present, where Mitch is now on Cartman's arm facing Mr. Garrison and Mr. Hat.] So how do I end up here, with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is? Life is funny like that. One day you're sifting through the guts of some gook in Vietnam and the next you're playing Dr. Phil with some kid and his teacher."
1218,14,6,Mr Garrison,"Eric I, [faces Cartman] I'm really sorry that you were put through all this."
1219,14,6,Mitch Conner,Sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end. That doesn't mean anything to this poor kid.
1220,14,6,Eric Cartman,That's right! Tell me the truth! Now!
1221,14,6,Mr Garrison,"[turns away] All I can tell you, Eric, is that we were all told to stick to the story, to protect someone very important. I can't say more, I won't. But I'll... I'll tell you who has the answer."
1222,14,6,Randy Marsh,"Look, gingers! You said you wanted Muhammad, we got him for you."
1223,14,6,Ginger 1,We have no way of knowing if Muhammad is really in there. It could be a trick.
1224,14,6,Stan Marsh,"It's no trick, dude. My friend and I went to the Super Best Friends and brought him here!"
1225,14,6,Ginger 1,Then have him step out of the bear costume! You have until the count of ten! One!
1226,14,6,Jimbo Kern,"Don't do it, Randy. If Muhammad is seen, we could get bombed."
1227,14,6,Ginger 1,Two!
1228,14,6,Sgt Yates,"Idiot, if he isn't seen, we're about to definitely get bombed."
1229,14,6,Ginger 1,Three!
1230,14,6,Randy Marsh,"Alright, alright, stop! We'll do what you say. [turns to the bear] I'm sorry, Muhammad. Will you please step out of the bear costume? [the bear looks around, then unzips the costume. A familiar red suit and black belt appear. The arms flail a bit and the costume drops away. Santa has stepped out of the costume.]"
1231,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, so um, see? This is Muhammad."
1232,14,6,Ginger 2,"That isn't Muhammad, that's Santy Claus."
1233,14,6,Santa Claus,"Sorry, boys. I tried."
1234,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,Aw crap.
1235,14,6,Randy Marsh,"Boys, you got Santa to be Muhammad? When?"
1236,14,6,Stan Marsh,When you all said you were gonna hand Muhammad over to Tom Cruise. We promised Jesus that Muhammad would stay safely in the U-Haul!
1237,14,6,Mr Hankey,"[hops up to Kyle] I'm sorry, Kyle. I really thought my idea would work for you."
1238,14,6,Stan Marsh,"If we were gonna have someone in a bear costume, why would we actually have it be Muhammad, you fucking idiot?!"
1239,14,6,Ginger 1,"So where is he?! [heavy footfalls and a mechanical roar are heard, and everyone gets afraid.]"
1240,14,6,Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the Hall of the Super Best Friends..."
1241,14,6,Jesus,"Buddha, will you lay off that stuff already?! It's gettin' to be a problem."
1242,14,6,Buddha,"Ohhh, and you're one to talk! With all your Internet porn!"
1243,14,6,Jesus,"Watching porn isn't like doing coke, fag!"
1244,14,6,Joseph Smith,[runs into the meeting room] Jesus Christ!
1245,14,6,Jesus,What?
1246,14,6,Joseph Smith,We've got a distress signal coming in. [the Super Best Friends leave their seats and head for the towering screen at one end of the room]
1247,14,6,Jesus,On the Super Best Screen!
1248,14,6,Police Officer,"Super Best Friends! You've got to help us! The Casa Bonita is under attack! [Casa Bonita is shown. Soldiers defend it by firing at Mecha-Streisand, but she just keeps walking towards it]"
1249,14,6,Jesus,"Great Scott! It's Barbra Streisand! [Mecha-Streisand picks up a car and bites the front end off. The driver drops down from it, likely to his death]"
1250,14,6,Lao Tse,I thought Barbra Streisand had been destroyed by Robert Smith.
1251,14,6,Seaman,Yeah. Who would have activated her again?
1252,14,6,Jesus,"I don't know, Seaman. [the other Super Best Friends chuckle]"
1253,14,6,Seaman,"[annoyed] It's Sea-Man! [the other Super Best Friends chuckle, but their attention is again drawn to the screen. ]"
1254,14,6,Police Officer,The Casa Bonita is gone! Jesus help us!
1255,14,6,Jesus,"Jesus... That's where the boys took Muhammad. We have to stop her! [he leads the others to Docking Bay Alpha] On the Super Best Friends power cycles! [moments later, amid a cloud of steam, a platform rises, and the Super Best Friends roll off it on modified Segways.]"
1256,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"There there, my little mouse friend. Soon you will have more asses than you ever dreamed of. [the top of his assistant's head is shown moving towards him] Ah, Kevin. You brought me my Fonseca. That's a good boy. [a pounding is heard at the door and both men turn around] What's this? Someone is at the door, Kevin. [the pounding is heard again] We tried to be left alone, Kevin. Who would disturb us at this hour? We must be careful. [looks through the peep hole] Why, it's an African-American man, Kevin. [to the person outside] Yes? What do you want?"
1257,14,6,Person,"[Mitch Conner, in blackface, wearing a wig] Yo man, sorry to bother you, but there's been an accident down the street, man. Can I use your telephone?"
1258,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"Oh I'm... terribly sorry, but I don't let strangers in."
1259,14,6,Person,"Yo, I understand, man, but this accident is real bad, dawg. My lady's leg is all busted up and shit; she all crawlin' around on the road lookin' like a crippled crab, man. I just need an ambulance, dog!"
1260,14,6,Dr Mephesto,There's a gas station about half a mile down the road. They have a phone there.
1261,14,6,Person,"Okay, I see. I guess I understand. You just don't wanna let a black man in yo' house."
1262,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"No, please, it isn't that at all."
1263,14,6,Person,"No, I gets it man. Thought things had changed, dog. Thought when we got a black president, things would be different. We gots our black president, but Whitey still don't trust me to use his motherfuckin' phone."
1264,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"No wait, I'm sorry, you're right you're right, we do have a black president. Please, come in. [opens the door, which is built like that of a bank vault]"
1265,14,6,Eric Cartman,[quickly gets in] Ahaaa!
1266,14,6,Dr Mephesto,WAAH!
1267,14,6,Dr. Mephesto and Kevin,AAAH!
1268,14,6,Eric Cartman,"Nice work, Conner."
1269,14,6,Mitch Conner,"Yeah, the old ""Hasn't anything changed?"" speech. Works on white people all the time."
1270,14,6,Dr Mephesto,Eric Cartman?
1271,14,6,Eric Cartman,"Surprise to see me, asshole?! Close the door!"
1272,14,6,Santa Claus,"[in the crowd] Holy crap! [as the crowd disappears, one lone boy walks towards the robot...]"
1273,14,6,Pip Pirrip,Cheeri-o! My name is Pip. I would like to see if you wouldn't mind not smashing our little town to bits. [the robot walks towards him and he turns and runs] Haaah! [Mecha-Streisand crushes him under her left foot]
1274,14,6,Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the Legion of Doom, which is Tom Cruise's house."
1275,14,6,Tom Cruise,How do you like that?! Celebrities can get violent too!
1276,14,6,Randy Marsh,"[on the community center roof with other townsfolk] Mr. Cruise, please call Barbra Streisand off! [everyone cringes as Mecha-Streisand walks around] She's destroying everything!"
1277,14,6,Tom Cruise,We will call her off when you give us Muhammad!
1278,14,6,Randy Marsh,We don't have Muhammad. We aren't sure where he is.
1279,14,6,Tom Cruise,That's your problem! Get him back or Babs will kill you all!
1280,14,6,Mickey Mouse,Oh boy!
1281,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Kenny! Kenny! Dude, what the hell?! You're supposed to be watching Muhammad!"
1282,14,6,Kenny McCormick,"(I am. He's right here.) [a locker to his left opens up and Muhammad steps out, a black rectangle with ""CENSORED"" on it covering him up]"
1283,14,6,Stan Marsh,Oh thank God. Hey Muhammad.
1284,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Really sorry about all this, dude. [to Stan] So what the heck are we gonna do now? Muhammad isn't safe here."
1285,14,6,Stan Marsh,The gingers and celebrities all want a piece of him. I don't know where we can go.
1286,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"[thinks a bit, then snaps his fingers] Wait. No wait a minute! I've got it. I've totally got it!"
1287,14,6,Kenny McCormick,(What?)
1288,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,Remember the time when we got an elephant to make love to a pig?
1289,14,6,Stan Marsh,[a bit surprised] ...Yeah.
1290,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I totally know how we can give the gingers and the celebrities what they want, but keep Muhammad safe. Come on! [they all run off]"
1291,14,6,Richard Tweek,She's going to get our coffee store next.
1292,14,6,Mr Slave,"Ooooo, Jesus Christ. [points to behind the camera. The Super Best Friends roll into town on their cycles]"
1293,14,6,Jesus,"That's enough, Barbra Streisand! Kiwaaa! [takes off his halo and hurls it at her. It bounces off her left shoulder and returns to Jesus. Barbra just gets more pissed off and turns to face Jesus. She walks towards him] Smith! Try your ice breath! [Joseph Smith steps forward and blows a stream of freezing air at Barbra's left claw. She looks at it and flexes her claws]"
1294,14,6,Joseph Smith,No good!
1295,14,6,Seaman,"Look out! Barbra Streisand is using her toxic stink ray! [Barbra unleashes a stream of brown gas from her genital area, making the Super Best Friends cough]"
1296,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"Eric, your father never wanted this to happen. He was protecting you as well as them."
1297,14,6,Eric Cartman,Them who?!
1298,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"Eric, you have to understand, it's all very complicated."
1299,14,6,Eric Cartman,Then start explaining it to me!
1300,14,6,Dr Mephesto,[heavy sigh] Very well.
1301,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, Muhammad, the door is open."
1302,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Dr. Mephesto, we need your help!"
1303,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"Oh for crying out loud, now everyone is letting themselves in! [goes to the door and locks it]"
1304,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Doctor, this is Muhammad. We want you to clone him, so we can give his copies to gingers, and Barbra Streisand."
1305,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"Oh, all right."
1306,14,6,Eric Cartman,No nooo no no no! He's not doing anything except explaining who my father is!
1307,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, that doesn't matter to people right now!"
1308,14,6,Eric Cartman,It's all that matters!
1309,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, nobody gives a crap about who your stupid father is! Muhammad is an important issue with actual ethical ramifications!"
1310,14,6,Eric Cartman,I guarantee you people care way more about who my father is!
1311,14,6,Announcer,"In the small mountain town of South Park, the holy prophet of the Mormon religion is trying to fly up the nose of a deadly female singer. [Barbra Streisand looks around. Krishna and Seaman float by either side of her head. Smith lands on her nose, but she tries to shake him off]"
1312,14,6,Seaman,"Our powers aren't working, Swallow. [The Super Best Friends float down towards Jesus]"
1313,14,6,Joseph Smith,We can't attack Streisand's nose! It's just too big!
1314,14,6,Jesus,We have to find another weak spot! [into his cuff] Moses!
1315,14,6,Moses,What?
1316,14,6,Jesus,We need to know any weakness Barbra Streisand might have!
1317,14,6,Moses,Um... Let me think... Um... Oh I know... Barbra Streisand can't resist singing duets with Neil Diamond.
1318,14,6,Jesus,"All right. I'll build a stage. Lao Tse, use mind control to get a huge audience. Buddha and Smith, use powers to find a band. Seaman, [chuckles] you and Swallow go get us sushi for dinner. [the other Super Best Friends start chuckling]"
1319,14,6,Seaman,It's Sea-Man and Swallow.
1320,14,6,Jesus,"Okay, Seaman, you guys head off!"
1321,14,6,Seaman,"Fine! Swallow, come. [the other Super Best Friends chuckle]"
1322,14,6,Moses,Heh heh heheheh. No way he just said that.
1323,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Alright alright, just tell Cartman who his dad is real quick so we can clone Muhammad."
1324,14,6,Dr Mephesto,It's a complicated story. I just can't tell him quickly.
1325,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Then we'll wait, because we have to clone Muhammad now!"
1326,14,6,Mitch Conner,Is Muhammad more important than a little boy's broken heart?
1327,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, you are not doing that again!"
1328,14,6,Mitch Conner,"Look, Mephesto, just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now!"
1329,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,Stop talking with your stupid hand!
1330,14,6,Eric Cartman,"Who you calling stupid, Jew?"
1331,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on, guys, we're running out of time! [more knocking is heard at Mephesto's door, and Mephesto turns around]"
1332,14,6,Dr Mephesto,Yes?
1333,14,6,Man (a ginger doing falsetto),"Hey, I'm sorry to bother you. There's uh, been an accident and I need a phone."
1334,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"Yeah, right, let me guess: You're an African-American."
1335,14,6,Man (a ginger doing falsetto),"...Well, yes I am, but I don't know what that has to do with anything."
1336,14,6,Dr Mephesto,Beat it I'm not helpin' you!
1337,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,Dude!
1338,14,6,Stan Marsh,That's not cool!
1339,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"No no, you don't understand."
1340,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,We understand you just sounded like a freakin' racist!
1341,14,6,Stan Marsh,"We don't live in the '60s anymore, you know! We have a black president!"
1342,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"Alright, alright, jeez. [walks to the door and opens it]"
1343,14,6,Ginger 1,Hahaaa!
1344,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh crap, the gingers!"
1345,14,6,Eric Cartman,Gingers? No!
1346,14,6,Announcer,"L-later, at the Legion of Doom."
1347,14,6,Benedict XVI,"Tom, Tom! The gingers are claiming they have Muhammad!"
1348,14,6,Tom Cruise,What?! Impossible!
1349,14,6,Benedict XVI,They are sending a message now!
1350,14,6,Tom Cruise,On screen! [The Legion of Doom's monitor lights up and the gingers are shown with Muhammad. The lead ginger gives the Legion a raspberry.]
1351,14,6,Ginger 1,[taunting] We got Muhammad! We got Muhammad!
1352,14,6,Rob Reiner,He's useless to you! You can't get Muhammad's power to not be made fun of without the Rob Reiner Goo Transfer Machine!
1353,14,6,Ginger 1,Why do you think we're calling?!
1354,14,6,Ginger 3,Our boss is willing to share Muhammad with you if you're willing to share the goo machine with us!
1355,14,6,Tom Cruise,...Your ...boss?
1356,14,6,Dr Mephesto,"What's going on? You got what you wanted, gingers, so let us go."
1357,14,6,Ginger 1,Oh no no! The head ginger has plans for you!
1358,14,6,Stan Marsh,What head ginger?! And where's Cartman?!
1359,14,6,Ginger 2,"Heheh, the head ginger has somethin' reeeally special planned for him."
1360,14,6,Eric Cartman,Hello? What the hell is this? Where am I?
1361,14,6,Mitch Conner,"You really got yourself in a mess this time, kid."
1362,14,6,Eric Cartman,"Shut up, Conner! How about I shove this flashlight in your mouth?"
1363,14,6,Mitch Conner,You might wanna [garbled sounds as Cartman puts the flashlight in his left hand]
1364,14,6,Eric Cartman,"Hello? I'm here, whoever you are. [a slow cackle rises from the darkness]"
1365,14,6,A Voice,Eric Cartman. I've waited a long time for this.
1366,14,6,Eric Cartman,Daddy?
1367,14,6,A Voice,"Guess again. [lights go one a few at a time. Carnival rides begin to appear. The Bean Dip Ferris Wheel. Chili-buster. The Chiliblast. A Hot Chili sign. A Professor Habanero chili booth. More signs come on, and the 2010 Chili Con Carnival is now live. Cartman is awed] Welcome, to my Chili Con Carnival."
1368,14,6,Eric Cartman,[strokes his chin and thinks] Chili Con Carnival? ...Wait a minute. ...No it can't be.
1369,14,6,A Voice,"Oh, but it can. [Cartman is looking at a throne with a staircase at its base. Six gingers stand guard on the ground and halfway up the steps. Around and behind the steps is a pile of broken baby dolls highlighted by two torches. one on either side of the stairs. The torches are topped with baby doll heads. On the throne itself sits one Scott Tenorman, with top hat and cane. His head is in the shadows] Revenge is a dish best served... [leans forward into the light] chili."
1370,14,6,Eric Cartman,Scott Tenorman. Eeewww.
1371,14,6,Announcer,"Meanwhile, at the concert stage Jesus built with his power of super-carpentry..."
1372,14,6,Joseph Smith,"[walks in with Buddha and Lao Tse] That's it, Jesus. The band has been paid and the PA system is working."
1373,14,6,Jesus,"[joins them and drops his hammer] Alright Krishna, the rest is up to you."
1374,14,6,Krishna,"[walks some distance] Form of... Neil Diamond. [poof! He is now Neil Diamond, who then goes on stage and addresses the crowd] If you all wouldn't mind, I'd like to invite a special friend to join me on stage. Miss Barbra Streisand! [Barbra hears her name and walks towards the stage]"
1375,14,6,Jesus,"Let's hope to Christ this works. [Barbra reaches the stage and lowers her head to Neil - er, Krishna]"
1376,14,6,Krishna,"Hello gorgeous. What do you say? Shall we sing together again like the old times? 
[Barbra roars and sits down on stage] 
Well that's because I love the girl. 
And I still love you now. What have you got to say? 
[Barbra roars, then the crowd roars] 
That might be true, but I still miss ya at night. 
[Barbra roars something] 
When you roll over, by my side, and you kiss me goodnight. 
[This excites Barbra, who roars and lets out a jet of toxic spray onto the audience. The audience members cough and try to shield themselves]"
1377,14,6,Joseph Smith,"It worked, Jesus!"
1378,14,6,Jesus,Yeah. And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!
1379,14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Do you remember when you had my parents killed and fed them to me as chili? I spent quite a while in a mental institution, Eric. [two ginger kids come and escort Cartman towards a ride] A lot of time for me to learn everything about you, so that one day I could take you down. I even learned the name of your father. [the two kids place Cartman in a car and sit on either side of him. The car begins to move. Screen 1] Oh, I know you're confused. Who wouldn't be? [Screen 2] You've been lied to by everyone! [Screen 3] Even by your own mother! [Screen 4] Hahahahahahahaha. [the car goes through some double doors]"
1380,14,6,Eric Cartman,What do you know?!
1381,14,6,Scott Tenorman,[Screen 5] I wanted to torment you with your father's identity. But what I found was more shocking than I could have possibly guessed!
1382,14,6,Announcer,"[sounding more and more wasted] Meanwhile, at the gingers' lair..."
1383,14,6,Russell Crowe,"Alright, Muhammad is secure. [moves off the machine]"
1384,14,6,Tom Cruise,"Let's do this. Throw the switch, Rob. [Rob Reiner throws the switch. The power level increases on the control panel. Moments later, goo moves from Muhammad through four tubes towards a mixer, then through two tubes towards Tom Cruise. Everyone watches in anticipation] Ohhh. Uhhh. Yes! I can feel it! I can feel the power to not be ridiculed flowing through my veins! [shakes violently for a second, then the machine shuts down. A ""CENSORED"" bar appears over Tom] Ha. Hahahaha! [laughs heartily]"
1385,14,6,Paris Hilton,O M G it worked!
1386,14,6,Tom Cruise,I've done it! I've done it! Look at me! I'm not okay to make fun of anymore!
1387,14,6,Benedict XVI,Ooo you lucky fucker.
1388,14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Welcome, everyone, to the final act of my fabulous Chili Carnival!"
1389,14,6,Liane Cartman,"Please, leave my boy alone!"
1390,14,6,Eric Cartman,Mom?
1391,14,6,Scott Tenorman,"I got them all here for you, Eric! So listen while you got told the truth!"
1392,14,6,Mr Garrison,Please don't. We have to protect 'em.
1393,14,6,Eric Cartman,Protect who??
1394,14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Yes, protect... who? Tell him! Mr... [points to] Jimbo! [with his cane]"
1395,14,6,Jimbo Kern,Protect... the Denver Broncos.
1396,14,6,Announcer,Meanwhile...
1397,14,6,Tom Cruise,This is incredible. Who wants to go next?
1398,14,6,Benedict XVI,I want to be next.
1399,14,6,Ginger 4,"No, gingers go next."
1400,14,6,Mickey Mouse,"Gingers can suck it! I'm next, ha!"
1401,14,6,Rob Reiner,It's my goo machine! I'm next!
1402,14,6,Jesus,"Nobody is going next! [Jesus, Buddha, and Joseph Smith run in while Lao Tse and Seaman drop in from above.] Muhammad is our super best friend! Let him go!"
1403,14,6,Ginger 4,They can't stop all of us! Get 'em!
1404,14,6,Jesus,[fends off every ginger who runs at him.] Kyaaaaa!
1405,14,6,Scott Tenorman,"The Denver Broncos. [turns to Cartman] There was a right tackle, see? Who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom, and everyone here covered it up! To protect the Bronco name!"
1406,14,6,Mr Garrison,They were having a really good year! There couldn't be any distractions!
1407,14,6,Eric Cartman,My dad was a Denver Bronco?
1408,14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Would you like to meet him? Well, you can't. Ever. 'Cause you see, Eric, we have something in common. Did I ever tell you that my father... played for the Denver Broncos?"
1409,14,6,Eric Cartman,No- nooo.
1410,14,6,Scott Tenorman,The only Bronco who lived in South Park. He got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named Liane Cartman!
1411,14,6,Liane Cartman,No please!
1412,14,6,Scott Tenorman,[to Dr. Mephesto] Tell him! You almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a Bronco fan! Tell him!
1413,14,6,Dr Mephesto,It's true... Jack Tenorman was your father.
1414,14,6,Scott Tenorman,You killed your own father and then you fed him to your half... brother!
1415,14,6,Eric Cartman,No! Noooo!
1416,14,6,Scott Tenorman,"Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha! Now eat your chili! [shoves Cartman's face into the chili, just as Cartman had done to him a long time ago. Cartman gags on the chili. A wall explodes and the captives and celebrities rush in, followed by the Super Best Friends] The Super Best Friends? Oh no! [makes a run out of the lair. Russell Crowe smacks Buddha a few times, but Buddha fights back]"
1417,14,6,Seaman,"I'll get you, Tom Cruise! [hops on him and wrestles him]"
1418,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey look! Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back. [everyone stops and gasps. The ""CENSORED"" bar disappears and Tom is shown again]"
1419,14,6,Tom Cruise,What did you say?!
1420,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,Oh yeah. Tom Cruise does have Seaman on his back.
1421,14,6,Jesus,I guess maybe Tom Cruise likes Seaman. [everyone chuckles.]
1422,14,6,Tom Cruise,[straightens up] Whoawhoa whoa whoa! [Seaman gets off his back] You're not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore! What the hell's going on?!
1423,14,6,Scott Tenorman,"[on the rafters with a jet pack on his back] I'll be back, Super Best Friends! [tales off through an open door on the roof.]"
1424,14,6,Jesus,Who's the creepy ginger kid?
1425,14,6,Tom Cruise,"Reiner, you said the goo machine would work! But I got made fun of!"
1426,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"That's because there is no goo, Mr. Cruise. You see, I learned something today. Throughout this whole ordeal, we've all wanted to show things that we weren't allowed to show. But it wasn't because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That's obviously the only true power. If there's anything we've all learned, it's that terrorizing people works."
1427,14,6,Jesus,"That's right. Don't you see, gingers?  If you don't want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop."
1428,14,6,Santa Claus,"That's right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence."
1429,14,6,Stan Marsh,[smiles and tilts his head to one side] Yeah.
1430,14,6,Mayor McDaniels,"Alright, people, let's start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time."
1431,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Oh dude, look. [Cartman is shown on a gurney, crying. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him] Hey, Cartman..."
1432,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Look man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear."
1433,14,6,Eric Cartman,Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman's dad. Don't you guys realize what that means?
1434,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, we, we know what it means."
1435,14,6,Eric Cartman,My dad was a ginger!
1436,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Wwait, what?"
1437,14,6,Eric Cartman,"I mean, obviously I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!"
1438,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you killed your own dad, and you're worried about that?!"
1439,14,6,Mitch Conner,"[appears] Hey Eric, Eric!"
1440,14,6,Eric Cartman,What?
1441,14,6,Mitch Conner,"Come on, cheer up."
1442,14,6,Eric Cartman,Cheer up? I'm half ginger!
1443,14,6,Mitch Conner,"Yeah, but you're forgetting, you're also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool."
1444,14,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you're right. That does make me pretty cool."
1445,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,You gotta be kidding me!
1446,14,6,Mitch Conner,"Shut up Kyle, you dumb Jew. [to Cartman] You've got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin' on."
1447,14,6,Eric Cartman,"Really Mitch? Ya, you've gotta go?"
1448,14,6,Mitch Conner,There's a bounty on my head and I can't afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.
1449,14,6,Eric Cartman,"Take it easy, Conner. [his hand floats away, then opens up all of a sudden. He wiggles his fingers. Next shot is of Tom Cruise sitting by himself on a trash can.]"
1450,14,6,Stan Marsh,"Look, Mr. Cruise, I'm sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that seaman on your back."
1451,14,6,Tom Cruise,I... I just can't do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there's nowhere on earth that people aren't around to rip on me.
1452,14,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up."
1453,14,6,Stan Marsh,"We do? Oh Oh yeah, we do!"
1454,14,6,Tom Cruise,"You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh. [stands up] Oh please, can you show me where?"
1455,14,6,Stan Marsh,We'll do better than that. We'll help you get there.
1456,14,7,Towelie,"[walking down the street being friendly] Hey everybody, how's it goin'?"
1457,14,7,Towelie,[taking a hit from a bong] I just... I just can't seem to stop.
1458,14,7,Towelie,Hey you! You goin' swimmin'? Don't forget to bring a towel. [coughs]
1459,14,7,Towelie,"[stumbling around, tattered and wasted] Get out of my face! Get out of here! [runs at the camera and shoves it out of his face. The camera spins around in a blur of lights]"
1460,14,7,Towelie,"[in studio] My name is Towelie. T O W E L uh-Y E Y. I'm great at cleanin' up spills. [a man spills his drink in a mall and Towelie throws himself at it, soaking it up. Next, he sends himself into a washing machine at a laundromat] And I'm 100% machine washable. I'm just... an ordinary towel, in a lot of ways. [hangs himself up to dry on a clothesline in someone's backyard] Except for one. [back to the studio] I'm addicted to marijuana. And crystal meth. ...aaand crack. [next scene is a wasted Towelie taking another hit from his bong]"
1461,14,7,Towelie,"[scorched and wasted, walks down the street] Hey buddy, want your dick sucked? [bends over for a moment] Does anybody want their dick sucked by a towel?"
1462,14,7,Stan Marsh,"Towelie has become a complete nightmare in our town! He's broken into my house twice, and stolen my allowance! I-I've got almost nothing left!"
1463,14,7,Kyle Broflovski,"If we're playing outside he shows up completely wasted and, and screaming how the government is following 'im."
1464,14,7,Butters Stotch,"[cries, taking a tissue from the box next to him] Why I, I just don't wanna watch him kill himself... I don't even know who he is anymore!"
1465,14,7,Stan Marsh,"There's noo doubt in my mind that if we don't get Towelie help, our entire summer is gonna be ruined! [Towelie is shown lighting a joint as the camera pulls away]"
1466,14,7,Singers,"Are you ready for the summer?
Are you ready for the good times?
Are you ready for the birds and bees?
The apple trees?
And a whole lot of fooling around?
Are you ready for the summer?
Are you ready for the good times?
Are you ready for the birds and bees?
The apple trees?

Are you ready for the fireflies,
the moonlit skies,
and a whole lot of fooling around"

1468,14,7,Timmy Burch,Timmeh!
1469,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,"We get to see all our old friends again. Hey, there's Frances. Hey Frances!"
1470,14,7,Frances,"[practicing how to light a fire with a stick, a bow, and a small board] Hi Jimmy, hi Tim."
1471,14,7,Timmy Burch,"[waves, grinning] Timmy."
1472,14,7,Specialist 1,"Wow, look at Lenora everyone. [Lenora dog-paddles her way to the shore] Good job. Come on, good job Lenora. Ahahall right, good, let's get Lenora a towel. [Lenora begins to shiver. The song ends at this point] Come on, come on, where's the towel?"
1473,14,7,Specialist 2,[looks inside the towel cart] The towel isn't here. I think it's off getting high again.
1474,14,7,Specialist 3,"[walks nearby looking for him] Hey! [startled, Towelie lets the rubber band snap off and fall to the ground] Where is that towel?!"
1475,14,7,Towelie,"Oh yeah, just a sec. [the specialist sees him]"
1476,14,7,Stan Marsh,[in studio] We went out and got Towelie a job so he could try to pay us back all the money he owes us! [crosses his arms] Stupid towel!
1477,14,7,Specialist 3,"[now next to Towelie] What's going on, Towel?"
1478,14,7,Towelie,Oh yeah I just had to take a piss. Sorry.
1479,14,7,Specialist 3,We got wet campers down there! Move your ass!
1480,14,7,Kyle Broflovski,"[in studio] When Towelie is doing heroin, he doesn't care about anything."
1481,14,7,Towelie,[now wasted and tattered] I don't care about anything. Stupid... handicapped... camp. [walks by a campfire circle where Jimmy is holding court with his team]
1482,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Alright blue team. As team captain, I need to make sure we are ready for the big camp competition."
1483,14,7,Elmer Fudd,"Oh we're weady aww wight. We can weawwy stick it to the wed team this yeaw, wahahahaha."
1484,14,7,Beaky Buzzard,"No way, Red Team can beat us, no way. Haha, hahaha."
1485,14,7,Droopy Dawg,Red Team won't know what hit them.
1486,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,All right! Everyone together! Are we gonna beat Red Team this year?
1487,14,7,Blue Team,Yeah!
1488,14,7,Timmy Burch,Timmy!
1489,14,7,Blue Team,Yeah! [a couple of members go on separately] Alright!
1490,14,7,Nathan,"I can't stand him, Mimsy. That Jimmy kid makes my fuckin... skin crawl."
1491,14,7,Mimsy,"Duhh you always hated Jimmy, boss. Ever since he whooped you at soifin' last summer camp, he really took it to you good, haha."
1492,14,7,Nathan,"[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy!"
1493,14,7,Mimsy,"Doh, sorry, boss."
1494,14,7,Nathan,Listen to me: there is no way that Blue Team is gonna beat Red Team this year at camp. You got that?
1495,14,7,Nathan,"What we need to do, Mimsy, is use a little brainpower to make sure Blue Team can't compete."
1496,14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy, we're gonna ruin Blue Team's chances, huh? We're gonna break their legs or somethin', boss?"
1497,14,7,Nathan,"[smacks him with a right hook and then shakes his fist] Shut up, Mimsssyyy! Just do what I say, and we can make sure Jimmy Valmer gets what's comin' to him."
1498,14,7,Specialist 1,"There you go, Lenora, all better now?"
1499,14,7,Lenora,"Yes, thanks."
1500,14,7,Towelie,"That's right. When you go swimmin', don't forget to bring a... [throws up all over Lenora]"
1501,14,7,Lenora,Uhhh!
1502,14,7,Specialist 3,"Who hired that towel? It can barely walk, let alone dry somebody off."
1503,14,7,Towelie,[picking a fight] You think you're better than me? Huh?! You think you're fuckin' hot shit?!
1504,14,7,Stan Marsh,"[in studio] A lot of times, when Towelie shoots heroin he just... gets angry at everybody."
1505,14,7,Towelie,"You can all suck it! You're all, you're all a bunch of towels, that's what you are! [walks off in disgust]"
1506,14,7,Butters Stotch,"[in studio, sobbing] The thing is, Towelie was pretty happy before. He had a girlfriend he liked. [a picture of the couple is shown, but her face is blurry. The picture was taken at a restaurant booth] And then she got pregnant and had a little washcloth. [A picture of the three of them at the hospital. She shows off Washcloth, but her face is still blurry] Mm but then Towelie just kept gettin' more and more high, and he got kicked out of the house."
1507,14,7,Towelie,"[wasted. wandering in the woods] Fuck you! Let me talk to 'im! Let me talk to 'im, you bitch!"
1508,14,7,Towelie,No! I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday! [the anger leaves his face] Oh. Oh it is Wednesday?
1509,14,7,Specialist 1,"[over the megaphone] All right, campers! Our first event is the big canoe race!"
1510,14,7,Pete Puma,"Oh boy, the canoe races! Heeee! [the team turns right and walks away]"
1511,14,7,Porky Pig,"We gotta be uh bitty bitty uh we uh we gotta be we gotta be uh we gotta bibbity beat the Red Team. [turns and walks off with the others. Nearby, Nathan and Mimsy listen in again]"
1512,14,7,Nathan,"I've got it, Mimsy. I got a way to win the race and get rid of Jimmy for good."
1513,14,7,Mimsy,"Darrr, oh boy, what are we gonna do, boss?"
1514,14,7,Nathan,"Simple, Mimsy, [pulls out a bag with something in it] We're gonna put a little surprise in the canoe."
1515,14,7,Mimsy,"Doh, dohhh, what kind of surprise uh? [Nathan pulls a snake out of the bag by its head] Oh! It's a snake."
1516,14,7,Nathan,"Not just any snake, Mimsy. It's a Black Mamba."
1517,14,7,Mimsy,"Aww, dah, jee whiz boss, we're gonna kill all the Blue Team and Jimmy, huh? [Nathan shushes him]"
1518,14,7,Specialist 4,You boys excited for the canoe race?
1519,14,7,Nathan,"Yes, counselor Steve. I like the fun canoe."
1520,14,7,Specialist 4,"[encouraged] Canoes are fun, aren't day? [walks away]"
1521,14,7,Nathan,"[now that the counselor is gone...] Now take the Black Mamba, [hands the bag to Mimsy] Mimsy, and put it in the canoe. I'm gonna go get our team ready."
1522,14,7,Specialist 1,"All right, campers are we ready?"
1523,14,7,All,Yeah!
1524,14,7,Nathan,"Good luck, Jimmy."
1525,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,"You too, Ne-n-Nathan."
1526,14,7,Nathan,"You're gonna need it, you fuckin' asshole."
1527,14,7,Specialist 1,"Oh your mark, get set. [shoots off her gun, and both boats take off. Nathan switches his oar to his right side, but notices something on the floor: the Black Mamba Mimsy was to put in the other canoe.]"
1528,14,7,Nathan,"Aaah! Holy shit, Mimsy! What the hell did you do?!"
1529,14,7,Mimsy,"Darrr, you said to put the Black Mamba in the canoe, boss."

1540,14,7,Nathan,"I finally got it, Mimsy. I got a way we can kill Jimmy and beat the Blue Team."
1541,14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy, what are we gonna do to him, huh boss?"
1542,14,7,Nathan,"Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Native Americans. [reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a map] Here, take this. [Mimsy takes it and opens it up] It's a fake scavenger hunt map."
1543,14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh, this map leads to the scavenger hunt?"
1544,14,7,Nathan,"No, that map leads to the Indian reservation. We switch this with Blue Team's scavenger hunting map, and they'll end up right on the Tardicaca Indian Reservation."
1545,14,7,Mimsy,"Dah-oh boy! We're gonna get Jimmy killed by Indians, huh boss? [again Nathan shushes him as a specialist draws near to them]"
1546,14,7,Counselor Steve,Are you boys excited for the neat scavenger hunt?
1547,14,7,Nathan,"Yes, Counselor Steve. I like a scavenger hunt. [Steve walks away] Alright Mimsy, now you take this map to the Indian Reservation, and you switch it with Blue Team's map. You got that, Mims? You switch the map! Switch! The map!"
1548,14,7,Mimsy,"I got it, boss. Switch the map. Switch the map. [walks away]"
1549,14,7,Mimsy,"Dah how come we're scavenger huntin' now, boss?"
1550,14,7,Nathan,"Because, stupid, now that we have Blue Team's map we can get their scavenger prize too."
1551,14,7,Mimsy,Dahhhoh boy!
1552,14,7,Nathan,"This doesn't make sense. Why would they make us walk this far? We're handicapped. ""Turn left at the..."" Wait. Waitaminute, what? What the? [finds his way onto the Tardicaca Burial Grounds] Oh fuck! Mimsy! This is the map to the Indian Reservation!"
1553,14,7,Mimsy,"Why sure it is, boss."
1554,14,7,Nathan,I told you to switch this with the map for the Blue Team!
1555,14,7,Mimsy,"No, you told me to switch the map, switch the map, so I switched it, and I switched it. [his motions indicate he just flipped the map this way and that]"
1556,14,7,Nathan,"Miiimmmssssyyyy! [all of a sudden, Indians appear on horseback.] Uh, my name is Nathan. I'm disabled. [the Indians fire at him and arrows go flying all over the place. He's struck a few times.] AAAAA!"
1557,14,7,Towelie,Hey everybody. Let's all go to the office supply store. [inside he grabs as many bottles of computer duster as he can]
1558,14,7,Cashier,You must have one dusty computer.
1559,14,7,Towelie,"[irritated] Fuck you! It's not illegal, bitch! [goes to his red car outside, gets in, and closes the door. Inside he takes out a bottle of computer duster and starts sniffing. He goes through bottle after bottle, screwing up his face more and more] I feel like I could conquer the world."
1560,14,7,Towelie,[taking a short break from his sniffing] It's like I'm walkin' on sunshine.
1561,14,7,Butters Stotch,"[in studio] I really think this intervention is Towelie's last chance. [at the Supply Max parking lot, walks up and kicks the door on Towelie's car] Towelie! Open the door!"

1569,14,7,Mimsy,"Oh boy oh boy! What are we gonna do to him, boss?"
1570,14,7,Nathan,"Simple. We're gonna get Jimmy eaten by a shark. [pulls out a small box in which is a whistle. He opens the box and takes out the whistle, and hads it to Mimsy] Here, take this. [Mimsy takes it, and Nathan puts the box back in his back pocket] It's a shark-mating whistle."
1571,14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh okay boss, a shark-mating whistle. We're gonna hit him over the head with it, huh boss?'"
1572,14,7,Nathan,"No, you moron. You go under the water and blow that whistle. You can attract sharks right as Jimmy starts to surf."
1573,14,7,Mimsy,Dahhh I've got it boss. I blow the whistle and make the shark come and bite Jimmy's legs off. [getting excited] Then he bleeds to death. He's gonna bleed to death. [Nathan shushes him again as Steve walks by]

1598,14,7,Butters Stotch,"[reads from a note he wrote down earlier] Towelie, over the past couple of years, I have seen drug addiction affect you in the following ways."

1605,14,7,Towelie,Could we just end this please?
1606,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"You have to let him finish, Towelie."
1607,14,7,Kyle Broflovski,If you do not accept treatment I will no longer give you money or be your friend. I will not help you kill yourself.

1616,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"Kyle please, It is not your turn!"

1654,14,7,Mimsy,"[hesitates, then] Dahh okay. It's real easy. You just play it like this. [takes the ukulele and begins to play]"
1655,14,7,Nathan,"[runs up and takes the ukulele from Mimsy] Mimsssyyy! You idio', wha' are you doin'?"
1656,14,7,Mimsy,"D'I was gonna show him how to play the solo, boss."
1657,14,7,Nathan,"That DOES it! I'm sick and tired of your stupidity, Mimsy! You are the biggest idiot I have ever met! And from now on, if I wanna do something, I'm gonna do it myself! [plays the solo and hits the right note. The ukulele blows up, launching him into the air] AAAAAAAA!"
1658,14,7,Nathan,"[lands with a thud on the beach] Uuuh! [gets up and swoons. The black mamba snake comes up and bites him on the left arm] AAAH! [a group of Tardicaca Indians rides by and shoots arrows into him. He falls to the ground again. The Tardicaca shark comes up out of the water again and humps him, again.] No, not the shark again! Not the shark again!"
1659,14,7,Towelie,"Oh no, oh Washcloth, I'm so sorry."
1660,14,7,Butters Stotch,"He needs you to get better, Towelie. Please. [resumes crying]"
1661,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"You've got so many people that just love the heck out of ya, Towelie. [resumes crying]"
1662,14,7,Towelie,"All right. All right, I'll go."
1663,14,7,Butters Stotch,You will?
1664,14,7,Towelie,I don't wanna hurt Washcloth anymore.
1665,14,7,Jeff VanVonderen,"He's goin', everybody. Hugs! [the other boys come in and hug Towelie]"
1666,14,7,Elmer Fudd,Ohh Wed Team. Your captain weawwy got waped.
1667,14,7,Pete Puma,I've never seen a kid get screwed by a shark before. Heeee!
1668,14,7,Beaky Buzzard,I hope I never see it again. Ahhahahaha.
1669,14,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Nathan, your team put up an amazing fight. And even though I was crowned the King of Cripple Camp, I want you to know that you were the real ch-cha, champ."
1670,14,7,Nathan,"I hate you, Jimmy. I fucking hate you with everything in my entire being."
1671,14,7,Mimsy,"Dahhh you sure got it stuck it to you this year, boss."
1672,14,7,Nathan,Shut up... Mimsssyyy. [the paramedics lift Nathan into the ambulance and take off]
1673,14,7,Rancho Palos Verdes Counselor,"Hi, Towelie?"
1674,14,7,Towelie,"Yeah, hi."
1675,14,7,Rancho Palos Verdes Counselor,"[in his office] Towelie is definitely one of the most addicted towels we've ever seen here. He's probably the second most psychologically damaged towel I've come across since treating Kirstie Alley's towel, which, had seen some... uuff, some nasty stuff."
1676,14,7,Towelie,"[on a bench overlooking the ocean] I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring, but I'm learnin' to love what I am. I'm a towel."
1677,14,7,Singer,"Veins swell
You know me, Ellen
Enough to tell
Five steps, you're over"
1678,14,8,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, dude, what's wrong?"
1679,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[crying quietly] Nothing. Just leave me alone, okay?"
1680,14,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you've been sitting at your locker crying since lunch break. Something's going on."
1681,14,8,Eric Cartman,It's just uh... that essay that Garrison assigned us.
1682,14,8,Kyle Broflovski,"""What I Wanna Be When I Grow Up""?"
1683,14,8,Eric Cartman,"I don't like thinking about what I wanna be when I grow up, alright?! [buries his head in his lap and cries some more]"
1684,14,8,Stan Marsh,Why not?
1685,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Because when I grow up, I wanna be something that I know I can never be, Stan!"
1686,14,8,Stan Marsh,"[faces Cartman] Cartman, tell us."
1687,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[sniffs] No... I wanna be a NASCAR driver, okay? When I see the... car races on TV, those... loud engines and peeling wheels, it's soo cool! [cries some more]"
1688,14,8,Stan Marsh,"Well Cartman, if you wanna drive NASCAR when you grow up, you can."
1689,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[cynically, walks off a bit] Oh right. Someone like me can be a NASCAR driver. [turns around and faces the boys] Look at me! [gestures to himself] Do you really think someone like this can ever become an awesome, famous NASCAR driver? [turns away]"
1690,14,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aww. Cartman, you can change things about yourself."
1691,14,8,Eric Cartman,No I can't; I'll always be like this. [wipes tears away]
1692,14,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, noo, you- you don't know that."
1693,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Come on you guys, I have to face facts. NASCAR is only for poor and stupid people. I don't have what it takes! [cries some more]"
1694,14,8,Kyle Broflovski,[reassessing his assumption] What?!
1695,14,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm not poor and stupid enough to do NASCAR, and I never will be!"
1696,14,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I don't think just poor and stupid people like NASCAR!"
1697,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh really? Hey, hey Kenny!"
1698,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[looks up from his locker] (What?)
1699,14,8,Eric Cartman,You love NASCAR huh?
1700,14,8,Kenny McCormick,"[showing the posters inside his locker] (Yeah dude, I looove NASCAR.)"
1701,14,8,Eric Cartman,"You see I told you guys! [turns and walks to his locker] What's the use? It just, it's hopeless! [puts his arm on the locker and rests his head on his arm]"
1702,14,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you are poor and you are stupid!"
1703,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[lifts his head up] I know you're trying to make me feel better, Kyle, but a rich smart kid has no place on a racetrack. [goes back to crying]"
1704,14,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, you are so retarded!"
1705,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, Stan, but even if I was I'd still be too rich."
1706,14,8,Kyle Broflovski,How are you rich?! Your mom pays for everything!
1707,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[stops crying and brightens up] You guys really think I could do this, don't you? You really believe in me. [smiles]"
1708,14,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I believe that you're a broke, ignorant idiot!"
1709,14,8,Eric Cartman,Then maybe I can make myself believe it too. [getting confident] Thanks you guys. I'm gonna go chase a dream. [Stan and Kyle just look at each other.]
1710,14,8,Eric Cartman,Butters.
1711,14,8,Butters Stotch,Hey Eric.
1712,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, the guys have been talkin' to me and well, they've got me pretty pumped up. [pumps both fists] I'm psyched, Butters. I'm about to do somethin' big and [pumps both fists] I'm psyched!"
1713,14,8,Butters Stotch,Ahhh well oh-[pumps his right fist] kay.
1714,14,8,Eric Cartman,But [points his right index finger at him] I'm gonna need your help. [points both index fingers at him] Can you get psyched?? Are you gonna get [pumps both fists twice] psyched up??
1715,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Eeyeah, I'm psyched."
1716,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Get really psyched up, Butters!"
1717,14,8,Butters Stotch,[starts pacing back and forth with energy] I'm really psyched! Yeah! Yeah let's do this alright?! I'm pumped I'm psyched! Alright. Yeah.
1718,14,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm gonna become a NASCAR driver, Butters. I'm goin' for the gold!"
1719,14,8,Butters Stotch,NASCA- NASCAR?
1720,14,8,Eric Cartman,"I know, I'm not poor an' stupid enough. But I change that, Butters, [reaches to his left and pulls into view a water jug full of small change] Here, I want you to take all my money. Every bit of it, Butters. Fifty-eight dollars and thirty-two cents."
1721,14,8,Butters Stotch,You're givin' away all your money??
1722,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[points] Just get rid of it Butters! Don't tell me where you spend it and don't ever let me have it back. [lowers his finger] From this moment on, I am poor. Like Kenny."
1723,14,8,Butters Stotch,You sure you want to do this?
1724,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[points] I told you I'm serious, Butters. [lowers his finger] This is my shot. I'm gonna get as poor an' stupid as I possibly can."
1725,14,8,Spokesman,"Alright folks, we wanna thank you all for comin' out an' supporting NASCAR."
1726,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[takes a 2011 calendar] (Yeah! How cool!)
1727,14,8,Spokesman,Now who's ready for Saturday's big race? [the crowd cheers]
1728,14,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
1729,14,8,Spokesman,We're really excited to be part of the fastest-growing sport in America! [the crowd cheers]
1730,14,8,Kenny McCormick,(Woohoo!)
1731,14,8,Spokesman,"I don't know about you, but I'm thrilled to watch NASCAR finally becoming recognized as a respected, legitimate sport. [the crowd cheers]"
1732,14,8,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah! Yeeaahh!)
1733,14,8,Butters Stotch,"[appears, hauling a cart] Hello! 'Scuse me! [the crowd quiets down and looks] I know that you NASCAR people don't have very much. So I went out and bought you all [shows off his haul] fifty-eight dollars worth of canned food and blankets! You're welcome! [turns around and skips away grinning] Heh! I helped the needy! [Kenny watches him leave]"
1734,14,8,Man 1,"[voice-over] Boy I tell you what, it is raining cats and dogs outside. Mostly cats. [laughter] I just wish I had brought an umbrella."
1735,14,8,Butters Stotch,Hey Eric.
1736,14,8,Eric Cartman,Ahh Butters. Did you give away all my money?
1737,14,8,Butters Stotch,Yep. You don't have a penny left. [points] You're poor as shit. [looks him over] How come you're hangin' upside down?
1738,14,8,Eric Cartman,"I need to get stupid, Butters. I'm getting all the blood to rush to my head and watchin' a marathon of Two and a Half Men."
1739,14,8,Charlie Harper,Hey- that's a hot girl over there. [giggles]
1740,14,8,Jake Harper,Sure she's hot. She's wearing a sweater. [giggles. The studio audience giggles and applauds]
1741,14,8,Butters Stotch,Feel stupid yet?
1742,14,8,Eric Cartman,Not yet.
1743,14,8,Woman 1,"When a woman isn't feeling her freshest, she turns to Vagisil-"
1744,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Aw Goddammit, another Vagisil commercial?!"
1745,14,8,Woman 1,"To stop feminine itching, and relieve vaginal odors."
1746,14,8,Eric Cartman,Fucking gross!
1747,14,8,Butters Stotch,All those ladies have stinky vaginas?
1748,14,8,Woman 1,"If you develop an allergic reaction, see your doctor. In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss."
1749,14,8,Woman 2,"For the freshest, cleanest feminine area, do what women do."
1750,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[quickly rights himself and stands up] Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa! Did you hear that?! [clicks on the remote control to reverse it, then plays and echoes the commercial] ""In some cases Vagisil can lead to short-term memory loss."" [clicks the remote to pause the playback] Oh my God, Butters... [makes a fist with his left hand] we need Vagisil!"
1751,14,8,Eric Cartman,"""Vagisil, Vagisil Maximum Strength, Vagisil Wash, Vagisil Medicated Wipes."""
1752,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Gee-whiz, there's Vagi-everythings."
1753,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Which one do I use to kill brain cells? Well, just buy me one of each of 'em, Butters."
1754,14,8,Butters Stotch,Wuh- uh I'm buyin'?
1755,14,8,Eric Cartman,I'm totally poor Butters. Did you forget?
1756,14,8,Butters Stotch,"But but I uh, I uh, I didn't bring any money, I didn't know I had to buy Vagisil."
1757,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Goddammit Butters! Alright just... just keep a lookout, I'll try it here. [positions him] Look that way, make sure the cashier doesn't see me. [As Butters keeps a look out, Cartman opens a tube of Vagisil anti-itch cream and begins to swallow it. Then he takes a bottle of wash and chugs that down, following that up with two more tubes, then more products] Is anybody coming?"
1758,14,8,Butters Stotch,"No, you're good. [behind them a woman and her daughter walk by and stop to look. Cartman chugs down another bottle of feminine wash]"
1759,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Mm, 'kay, Mm. [throws the bottle away] N-oh, ew, okay, now it's... [grabs a tube of maximum strength anti-itch cream]"
1760,14,8,Woman 3,"Little boy, what are you doing? [Cartman looks over his shoulder, then turns around to look at her. Butters notices and does the same. A few seconds later, Cartman turns away]"
1761,14,8,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! Butters! [taps Butters' shoulder and Butters turns around] I feel kind of stupid!
1762,14,8,Butters Stotch,Really?
1763,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes, YES! I'm feeling totally stupid right now."
1764,14,8,Butters Stotch,That was fast.
1765,14,8,Eric Cartman,Grab what you can and let's get out of here. I'm ready!
1766,14,8,Announcer,We're just seconds away from the start of the Denver 300. [Dale Evans is shown in his car]
1767,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Excuse me. Mr. Evans, sir? [Dale looks over to his left. Butters is in the pit stop] Your uh, your wife is on the phone and- uh, well- she just got raped."
1768,14,8,Dale Evans,What?
1769,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, she got, she got raped a lot and uhhh- and you gotta go talk to her."
1770,14,8,Dale Evans,"Oh my God! [gets out of his car, throws down his helmet, and goes to the pit area]"
1771,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[walks towards the car] Sweet. Nice work, Butters. Now go be my spotter so we can win this thing! [puts on the helmet and climbs into the car]"
1772,14,8,Butters Stotch,"[now on the walkie-talkie] Eric, are you sure you can do this?"
1773,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[Swallows another tube of Vagisil] Don't worry, Butters, I'm totally poor and stupid. I'm ready for NASCAR."
1774,14,8,Announcer,Let the race begin!
1775,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Let's go NASCAR! [the other drivers zoom past him. He steers the wheel, but realizes] I'm not moving, Butters."
1776,14,8,Butters Stotch,I think you gotta press the gas pedal.
1777,14,8,Eric Cartman,What's that?
1778,14,8,Butters Stotch,There's like a long pedal on the floor by your right foot.
1779,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh okay. [leans down to press it. He burns rubber and takes off, as ""La Grange"" by ZZ Top plays] Let's go NASCAR! [he immediately crashes into the wall and tries to power out of it. Suddenly, he turns left and goes back the other way]"
1780,14,8,Announcer,It looks like the Dale Evans car is going the wrong way!
1781,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Kewl, NASCAR! Sweet! [the other drivers round the corner and avoid him. Car #78 crashes through the wall and plows up the bleachers. Cartman tries to turn around but goes up into the air and into the pit area. Everyone there gets out of the way. He hits a low wall and goes up into the air again...]"
1782,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[abash] Oh, fuck my ass! [he lands in a lake by the Winners Circle.]"
1783,14,8,Butters Stotch,[on the walkie-talkie and mortified] Eric?
1784,14,8,Eric Cartman,All that work... All the effort I put in... I still wasn't poor and stupid enough to win.
1785,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Eric, uh you were as poor and stupid as you could be."
1786,14,8,Eric Cartman,[looks away] Don't you get it Butters?! It's never gonna happen for me! Those people are way more poor and stupid than I'll ever be. I might as well kill myself.
1787,14,8,Butters Stotch,Eric! Don't ever talk like that!
1788,14,8,Eric Cartman,I've given away all my money! Drank enough Vagisil to kill every brain cell I have! But it still wasn't enough.
1789,14,8,Doctor,"[enters the room] Alright Eric, we got the X-rays back."
1790,14,8,Butters Stotch,"How bad is it, doctor?"
1791,14,8,Doctor,"He has two fractured ribs, a broken femur, torn ligaments in both knees, and a level 2 concussion. He also appears to be developing three small vaginas in his stomach, but they are all sparkling clean."
1792,14,8,Butters Stotch,Well at least there's that.
1793,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Just pull the plug on me, doctor. I don't wanna live like this."
1794,14,8,Doctor,You aren't on life-support. Pulling a plug wouldn't do anything.
1795,14,8,Eric Cartman,Aw donkey balls...
1796,14,8,Doctor,"You're lucky to be alive, young man. Sneaking onto a NASCAR racetrack and hijacking a car for a joyride? That has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever heard of a kid doing! [walks away]"
1797,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, doc, but you aren't gonna make me feel any better."
1798,14,8,Doctor,"[turns around] No, really. Of all the idiotic dumb ways I've seen kids injure themselves, yours takes the retard cake! [walks out of the room]"
1799,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Did you hear that, Eric? See? You are really stupid."
1800,14,8,Eric Cartman,Could it be I... only lost the race because I somehow wasn't poor enough?
1801,14,8,Butters Stotch,"It has to be, Eric. [Cartman moves his right leg out of the sling and gets out of bed.] Eric, where are you going?"
1802,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Get me my coat, Butters. We're gonna try this thing again. [Butters brightens up]"
1803,14,8,FOX 11 Anchor,"You're watching Colorado FOX 11. Next on FOX 11 News, are NASCAR fans stupid? [Kenny looks up] Some people are starting to wonder after a NASCAR fan apparently got high on Vagisil and snuck onto the track, killing eleven people."
1804,14,8,Reporter 1,"Tom, the NASCAR fan got into a car here on Sunday and crashed in the lake behind me. He was later found to have ingested this [holds up a tube] Maximum Strength Vagisil. And also Vagisil medicated wipes. Making NASCAR fans look ...pretty stupid, Tom."
1805,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[closes his magazine and throws it on the sofa in a blind rage] (No! NASCAR fans aren't stupid! Cartman is!)
1806,14,8,Reporter 1,"The NASCAR fan vows he will try to do it again, but that this time, he'll win."
1807,14,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Oh that fucking asshole!) [gets off the couch and walks out the front door, vexed] (Oh that fucking asshole, I'm gonna talk to him...)"
1808,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh hey, Kenny! [Kenny is not happy and his arms are crossed]"
1809,14,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, what the fuck are you doing?!)"
1810,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Come in dude, I wanna show you what I've been workin' on. [Kenny follows him in. Cartman shows him all the stuff he purchased - a jet ski, a Room-bot, a 7.1 speaker system, a plasma TV, an LCD monitor, a VHS/DVD combo player] Check it out. I thought I could just give all my money away and be as poor as your family, but then I realized: what do poor people do? Buy things even though they don't have money by going out and purchasing things that are 0% down and no payments for two years! That's how you people stay poor forever! Am I right? That's it, right? [Kenny is still pissed off]"
1811,14,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Dude, fuck you!)"
1812,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, I'm just trying to get good at NASCAR."
1813,14,8,Kenny McCormick,(Being poor has nothing to do with NASCAR!)
1814,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[annoyed] Hey, I love NASCAR just as much as you do!"
1815,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[apoplectic] (No you fucking don't!)
1816,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I've had to become poor all on my own, you know?! I wasn't born with a plastic spoon in my mouth!"
1817,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[thinks for a moment] (What?!)
1818,14,8,Eric Cartman,"I've had to go buy stuff with 0% down and no payments for two years my-self! I didn't have parents to do it for me like you do! [Kenny raises his fists up, but Cartman hugs him with one arm] Look Keh- Kenny, Kenny. We shouldn't be fighting. We both love NASCAR and we're both poor as shit."
1819,14,8,Man 1,"[appears at the front door] Uh, excuse me. [Cartman sees him and walks to the door] Eric Cartman?"
1820,14,8,Eric Cartman,Yeah?
1821,14,8,Man 1,My name is Geoff Hamill. I'm the founder and CEO of Vagisil.
1822,14,8,Eric Cartman,...Uh oh.
1823,14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Young man, your NASCAR stunt has brought a lot of attention to Vagisil and honestly, I don't know how to thank you. Our sales are up and women are finally realizing that their feminine odor can be treated. I first created Vagisil for my wife, Patty. [steps aside to reveal Patty standing halfway out in the yard] She's my Muse, my flame. We realized that NASCAR can do a lot for product recognition and so, Vagisil has a little present... for you. [turns around and walks out, showing off a brand-new Vagisil NASCAR car]"
1824,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Awww, sweet! [runs to the car, then runs his right hand over the body] No way, this is so tits!"
1825,14,8,Geoff Hamill,Vagisil would like you to represent us in the next NASCAR race.
1826,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Dude, check it out, Kenny! My very own NASCAR!"
1827,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[angrily in disbelief] (No fucking way!)
1828,14,8,Geoff Hamill,And we've modified the cockpit to be operated properly by a child.
1829,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Aww coool, huh Kenny? [Makes engine revving and shift change noises]  I got a NASCAR, Kenny! [Geoff looks at Kenny, smiling] So awesome, huh Kenny? [Kenny can only look on angrily]"
1830,14,8,Announcer,"We are now live at the NASCAR press conference, where the drivers of Saturday's race are gearing up and taking questions from reporters."
1831,14,8,Reporter 1,"So uh what's your guys' take on the track here? Any concerns? [present are Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Jimmie Johnson, Danica Patrick, Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Eric Cartman, and Matt Kenseth]"
1832,14,8,Jimmie Johnson,"Well I think it's a fine track, you know. The- the techs have done a really good job of makin' sure the banks are grafted down to the right specs and there shouldn't be any problems-"
1833,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[doing a redneck accent and acting completely stupid] Yeah, we like the track, yup. We gotta graft them banks an' specs, it's like an oval, so we're gonna drive straight and then we're gonna be turnin' to the left."
1834,14,8,Reporter 2,Uhhh they're saying hot weather tomorrow; any concerns about restrictor plate or brake fade problems?
1835,14,8,Jeff Gordon,"Of course, any time you're dealin' with high humidity and temperatures you need to compensate your brake fluid, but the plates themselves-"
1836,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Compensate yer blake fluid an' git yer, git yer... b-brake workin' so you can stop sometimes."
1837,14,8,Dale Earnhardt,"Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?"
1838,14,8,Jr,"Hey excuse me, who is this kid? Is he even a driver?"
1839,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Ewww, bring it on, Earnhardt, you scared of the competition?! I'm just as poor an' stupid as you! I'm gonna drive and I'm gonna go fayast and I'm gonna turn to the left sometimes!"
1840,14,8,Danica Patrick,"Can we just, get back to the subject of racing, please?"
1841,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Uh-ho! Bring it on, Danica! You dumb bitch! Think I can't steer left better than you?!"
1842,14,8,Butters Stotch,"You seemed really stupid, Eric."
1843,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Thanks, B-butts. I really think I can hold my own against these guys. Little worried about that Jimmie Johnson guy though; he seems dumber than spit. And that Danica Patrick chick? Phew! We're gonna need to get even poorer and stupider, Butters. Both of us."
1844,14,8,Tony Kornheiser,"Alright, from the NFL we now turn to the world of NASCAR! People who weren't sure what to think of NASCAR are more sure today after a NASCAR driver released bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast."
1845,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, what's up NASCAR fans? I don't know about y'all, but this President Obama is pissin' me off! So I'm gonna do some dip and speak my mind. Today I'm gonna be dippin'... [holds up a bottle] Vagisil Regular Strength Anti-Itch Creme. [squeezes some out and rubs it all over his lips] Oh yeah. Yeah, that's a big dipper right there. But I'm pretty pissed off at what I found out. I found out this ""Obama"" wants to put a bigger tax on gasoline! [spits into a can] What the fuck is up with that?! That's fuckin' gay! And he's fuckin' gay as hell! [Kenny buries his face in the counter, in shame. On screen, Butters appears behind Cartman] You all know my pit boss, Butters. [Butters appears over by the grill, also with a mouthful of Vagisil]"
1846,14,8,Butters Stotch,Obama's fuckin' gay.
1847,14,8,Eric Cartman,He's fuckin' gay as hell!
1848,14,8,Butters Stotch,Pissin' me off!
1849,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[dips again and rubs it on his lips] So y'all be sure to catch us in our next race. We're about as poor an' stupid as they fuckin' come, so come down an' cheer for us at NASCAR on Saturday! Obama's gay as hell!"
1850,14,8,Tony Kornheiser,"[back to kenny sitting watching TV at Mick's Lanes] Well if you ask me, that's all the proof we need that NASCAR really is just for the poor... [sharply] and the stupid."
1851,14,8,Kenny McCormick,"[Kenny has enough as he slammed his fist in anger] (Fuck this!) [leaves the bar, livid]"
1852,14,8,Commentator 1,The stage is set for what could be the most important race of the NASCAR year.
1853,14,8,Commentator 2,"Lots of speculation and interest in the Vagisil car, driven by Eric Cartman. We are joined now by the inventor and owner of Vagisil, Geoff Hamill."
1854,14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Thank you, Chris."
1855,14,8,Chris (Commentator 2),[Commentator 2] Geoff? Why did you decide to sponsor a NASCAR driver?
1856,14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Vagisil is very excited to be part of the NASCAR phenomenon, Chris. You know, I... first created Vagisil to try and help my wife, Patty. She is my Muse, my flame. Wherever Patty goes her smile lights up the room. Her vagina, on the other hand, clears the room and makes it uninhabitable for weeks."
1857,14,8,Commentator 1,"Ohkay, well the race is about to start, so why don't we kick it back down to the track?"
1858,14,8,Announcer,"[Over the PA system] Gentlemen, start your engines! [the crowd begins to cheer]"
1859,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Alright, ""start your engine."" What's that mean?"
1860,14,8,Pit Crewman,"That means you flip the switch that says ""Engine."" [to Butters] Is he stupid or what?"
1861,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, he's a champion alright."
1862,14,8,Security Guard,"Check your bag please, sir? [Kenny hands him the bag. The guard checks the bag and pulls out a long rifle] No, no, see, this won't do. You can't bring a sniper rifle onto the track."
1863,14,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Aww, come on!)"
1864,14,8,Security Guard,"Look, NASCAR is trying to change its image. It's people like you that are givin' NASCAR a bad name!"
1865,14,8,Kenny McCormick,"(Aw come on, fuck you!) [enters]"
1866,14,8,Security Guard,"You might be able to buy one in the gift shop. [inside, the cars begin to move down pit lane]"
1867,14,8,Announcer,[Over the PA] The drivers are slowly heading out to follow the pace car.
1868,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[in the redneck accent] Then I'm gonna press the gas pedal and I'm gonna go forward. [does so and rear-ends #78, then back up and swerves onto the track and sideswipes #95 and #78] NASCAR! Yee-ah!"
1869,14,8,Pit Crewman,"This is just the pace lap, you don't go full speed yet!"
1870,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, just the pace lap! I'm gonna hit the, hit the brake! [hits the brakes and #7 runs into him. Danica Patrick is the driver]"
1871,14,8,Danica Patrick,[infuriated] The fuck are you doing?!
1872,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[gives her the middle finger] Fuck you, Danica Patrick! You ain't half as dumb as me! Gas pedal! [steps on the gas and peels away. Other cars pass Danica, whose engine is now on fire]"
1873,14,8,Danica Patrick,"Oh, son of a bitch!"
1874,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Woowee, ain't nobody can stop muhey!"
1875,14,8,Commentator 1,And it looks like the Vagisil car has already clipped two other drivers and taken them out of the race.
1876,14,8,Chris (Commentator 2),"Yea, the other drivers are not going to be happy about this. What do you think, Mr. Hamill?"
1877,14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Vagisil is a company that really stands behind its product, Chris. We want women to know that Vagisil is effective, safe for use every day, [looks at Patty and enunciates] Every. Day. [she just stands there] Every. Day. [she looks down and away] ...And available nationwide."
1878,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Be careful up here about a hundred yards, Eric. There's a wrecked car on the right side. [Danica Patrick finally comes out of her car] You're gonna wanna watch for it here. You're gonna wanna watch it over on the right side."
1879,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Oh yeah, I see it. [Cartman avoids the car, but runs over Danica, who was trying to make it across the track to the field inside]"
1880,14,8,Danica Patrick,AAAAAA! [Cartman keeps going and ran over her]
1881,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[looks over his right shoulder, then faces forward again] You see that? Daynicuh Patrick tried to get in my way. That pisses me off!"
1882,14,8,Butters Stotch,That's fuckin' gay as hell.
1883,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Whoop I'm comin' up on that turn thing again. I got to stayer left. [turns the steering wheel hard to the left and drives through the drivers' eating area and the pedestrians all running and screaming, Cartman ran over most of them and some survived by running from the side] Get out of the way you idiots, I'm tryin' to win this dayum thang! ""[Cartman made it back on the track]"""
1884,14,8,Butters Stotch,There you go. You're back on the track.
1885,14,8,Eric Cartman,"I'm back own the track. [An enraged Kenny makes his way down the bleacher steps towards the track. He jumps onto the track and lands on the Vagisil car. He turns around on the car roof and looks into the car through the windshield, Cartman also enraged as well] What the... Kenny! What the hell are you doing?!"
1886,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[pounds on the windshield] (Stop this car!)
1887,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[irked] Get off my car, Kenny!"
1888,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[inflamed] (Stop this car right now!)
1889,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Oh man, now our friend Kenny's tryin' to break the windshield. Ain't that just gay as hell? [the #14 car is getting its wheels changed when Cartman barrels into it, causing it to flip over and land on its pit crew, killing them]"
1890,14,8,Eric Cartman,"We're tradin' paint! [further down the track he hits two other cars, which then slammed into each other. Back to Cartman, he's furious] Oh it's sooo easy for you, isn't it, Kenny?! I have to prove myself!"
1891,14,8,Kenny McCormick,[incensed] (I fucking hate you!)
1892,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[determined and angered] Sorry dude, I'm winning this race! Hit the brake! Bye Kenny. [steps on the brakes, launching Kenny at the end of the track]"
1893,14,8,Kenny McCormick,"(AAAAAAAAAAAAAA...) [goes a long distance before the first bounce, then bounces a few more times. Two other cars remain on the track, and they pass Cartman]"
1894,14,8,Driver,"Oh Jesus, there's a little boy on the track. [the two cars swerve just in time, but one crashes into the outer wall, the other into the inner wall, Kenny ducks]"
1895,14,8,Chris (Commentator 2),"Well it appears that all the other drivers have crashed and only the Vagisil car remains. Looks like you're going to win, Mr. Hamill."
1896,14,8,Geoff Hamill,"This is such a great day for Vagisil, Chris. Our product awareness will be at an all-time high. Feminine odor must be treated diligently. [looks over at Patty] Very. Diligently. [a look of shock crosses his face. Patty is gone. The cameramen wonder what's going on.] Patty? Patty?"
1897,14,8,Announcer,It looks like a woman is trying to take over for Jimmie Johnson's car. [Mr. Hamill and the commentators join him in his booth]
1898,14,8,Geoff Hamill,"What? [Patty gets the car started and backs up. Determined, she takes off as ""La Grange"" starts playing again]"
1899,14,8,Lowes Pit Boss,Ma'am? You are on an active racetrack. This is extremely dangerous.
1900,14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Let me talk to her. [puts on the pit boss's headphones] Patty? Patty, what are you doing? [Patty skillfully drives the car around the track] Patty, pull over the NASCAR. You're acting irrationally. Patty, did you forget to take your medication? You know how you get when you don't use your Vagisil. There should be some in your purse, my Muse. Patty? [she reaches Cartman and taps his car with Johnson's]"
1901,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Aww! You dumb bitch! Butters, this bitch is tryin' to wreck mah car."
1902,14,8,Butters Stotch,I know. That pisses me off. That's fuckin' gay.
1903,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Fuckin' gay as hell. [Patty pulls up to his left, taps him a bit, then pulls away.]"
1904,14,8,Geoff Hamill,"Patty, you are my Muse, and my flame."
1905,14,8,Announcer,They are neck and neck approaching the finish line. [This time she bumps him off. Cartman's car spins out then flips up in the air...]
1906,14,8,Eric Cartman,"[Shocked] Oh, fuck my ass again! [...and crashes upside down into the outer wall. Patty goes onto the finish line, getting the victory for Jimmie Johnson]"
1907,14,8,Geoff Hamill,[Geoff is frustrated] HAAAAAAAAAA!
1908,14,8,Announcer,Big celebration for the Lowe's Home Improvement team.
1909,14,8,Geoff Hamill,Patty! How could you?! You've ruined us! You've ruined Vagisil!
1910,14,8,Kenny McCormick,(HA! You fucking lose!) [crosses his arms in triumph]
1911,14,8,Eric Cartman,"No, no, Kenny, go ahead. I deserve it. [Kenny is confused] I thought I could just waltz onto a racetrack and do what these people do. But I owe you an apology. The truth is I'm just too smart. And with how smart I am I'll always be successful and therefore have money. I just have to accept I'm too smart and rich for NASCAR. Time for me to give it up. Alright Butters, give me back my money."
1912,14,8,Butters Stotch,[flabbergasted] Huh?
1913,14,8,Eric Cartman,[livid] The fifty eight dollars and thirty two cents I gave you! I want it back!
1914,14,8,Butters Stotch,"Uh, but- but you- you said I had to [begins to stammer, both walk off, as Kenny stares in confusion] s-spend on it on the... buy what I can start buyin' and start way in- bu- so get buy- [unintelligible]"
1915,14,8,Eric Cartman,"Goddammit Butters, you'd better have it! Butters, you're always trying to screw me over!"
1916,14,8,Butters Stotch,But you said to take your money so I took it by [unintelligible] Ah I don't know.
1917,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Mom, Dad, what's ""muff cabbage""? [Gerald and Sheila pause. They look at each other, then turn back to their son]"
1918,14,9,Gerald Broflovski,[confused] Muff cabbage?
1919,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,[also confused] Where did you hear that?
1920,14,9,Ike Broflovski,Muff cabbage!
1921,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"The new neighbors that moved in next to Stan's house. Me and Ike saw the mom get a parking ticket, and she called the parking cop ""muff cabbage""."
1922,14,9,Ike Broflovski,Muff cabbage.
1923,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,A new family moved in? Where are they from?
1924,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,She said they're from New Jersey.
1925,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,[drops her fork] New Jersey? A family from New Jersey moved in next to the Marshes?
1926,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah. Stan said they're having them over for dinner tonight.
1927,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[fearful, quickly leaves her chair and walks off a bit] Oh, God. Poor Sharon. Doesn't she know?"
1928,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Know what, Ma?"
1929,14,9,Ike Broflovski,Muff cabbage!
1930,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,Never invite a New Jersey housewife into your home.
1931,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","[at the head of the table. Sharon is to her right] And so then I met the school principal. What's her name? Principal Victoria? What a stupid bitch! I mean, excuse my language, but that bitch needs her fuckin' head examined!"
1932,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Yeah, so my family and I moved from Jersey to South Park about a week ago. So far, I can tell that everyone here really likes me."
1933,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Oh! And I met that Stotch woman. What's her name?
1934,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Linda, huh?"
1935,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Have you noticed how yellow that bitch's teeth are? You can tell that woman is a piece of garbage. She's garbage! [the girls at the table just look on and continue eating] I went into the mall here and I just about dropped dead. The only panties you can buy makes you look like you got a grandma muff! Where's the Gucci? Where's the Prada? Have they heard of Italian clothes? It's ridiculous!
1936,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","[as Teresa rattles on] So Randy, what gyms are good around here? Where do you work out?"
1937,14,9,Randy Marsh,I don't really work out.
1938,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Well, I gotta find somethin'. [flexes his left biceps] My biceps are goin' flat."
1939,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Where can you get good clothes in this town?! Nowhere! I mean, that's why you're stuck wearing garbage like that, right? And the woman that works the hair salon? Julia? Have you seen how big that bitch's ears are?"
1940,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, Julia's a friend of mine, yeah."
1941,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Ears out to here! [spreads her arms out as far as they could go] So I tell her, ""You got big ears, sweetie."" I'm not trying to be mean. It's just a Jersey thing. Why be offended? [to Sharon] I mean, you've got a big chin. We've all got imperfections."
1942,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Right, just like your eyes are kind of far apart. [Teresa's expression changes to a dark mood]"
1943,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","That was totally uncalled for, for what she did. My eyes are too far apart? And like who is she? Is she God? No."
1944,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","You don't ever, ever! You whack job, prostitution... [slams her hands on the table] ...whore! You probably sell your muff... [slams her hands on the table] ...for six dollars! You fucking psycho bitch! Fuck you! [lifts the table, which causes it to dump the food on the floor. Sharon quickly hides behind Randy] You're nothin' but garbage! [Joe comes up and restrains her from behind] That's what you are! You're garbage! [Stan's eyes dart back and forth] You sick, old woman! Muff garbage! [Joe takes her into the kitchen] Muff cabbage! Fuck this psycho bitch!"
1945,14,9,Sharon Marsh,Wow.
1946,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Let's get the fuck outta here! She's a fuckin' pig! She's fuckin' pissin' me off! [to Joe] Okay, I love you."
1947,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Take it easy.
1948,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",I love you. [they kiss] I love you.
1949,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","I thought I was gonna deck her. I was fine. I was really fine. I just wanted to get my point across to her, and then that's how I am. [she takes Joe's hand and walks him back into the dining room] Like I could be mad one minute and then I'll be fine."
1950,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Okay, all better. Just had to get that out. It's just... it's a Jersey thing. So, who wants dessert? Meeee!"
1951,14,9,Stan Marsh,You guys do not understand. Having neighbors from Jersey is the worst! All night long they keep me awake! They're either screaming at each other or making some disgusting sex sounds. It seems like all people from Jersey do is hump and punch each other!
1952,14,9,Eric Cartman,"You know what you do when you want a family to move away? Every night, you go and take a crap on their doorstep."
1953,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,[glaring at him] Is that why there's crap on my doorstep every morning?
1954,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Oops, busted. [avoids eye contact]"
1955,14,9,Stan Marsh,"They talk way too loud, they flip out for no reason, and every time they act like selfish assholes, they just go, ""Oh, it's a Jersey thing. It's a Jersey thing."""
1956,14,9,Jersey Man 2,"Hey, you talkin' 'bout Jersey? Me and my friends are from Jersey."
1957,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Aw, crap, there's more of them?"
1958,14,9,Jersey Man 2,"'Ey, come on, there's people from Jersey all over! Who here is from Jersey? [a lot of people respond excitedly]"
1959,14,9,Steve Last Call,"So I'm like standin' there, and I'm like, ""Who's from Jersey?"", and people are all like, ""Yo! Woo-hoo!"" Next thing you know, Jersey party at Sizzler. [the restaurant is transformed into a club]"
1960,14,9,Jersey Woman,"[nude in a in a Jacuzzi] Yeah, let's get this party started. [a random fight breaks out]"
1961,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where the hell are they coming from?! [a bottle of Corona beer lands in front of the boys and shatters]
1962,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Danielle was being a stupid bitch.
1963,14,9,Woman 1,"Shut up, Teresa. You're pathetic!"
1964,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","I'm pathetic? You're muff gabbage! [Sharon walks into the salon. Teresa gets up to greet her] Oh, Sharon! [they hug] Hi, sweetie. You gotta meet our new neighbors. This is Jacqueline. She's from Jersey."
1965,14,9,"Jacqueline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",And Sicilian.
1966,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",That's Danielle. She's from Jersey. [Danielle is extremely tanned] And that's Caroline.
1967,14,9,"Caroline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",I'm having my face shaved. It's a Jersey thing.
1968,14,9,Salon Girl,"I'm sorry, but I have other clients in ten minutes. Can you sit down? [Teresa didn't like that request]"
1969,14,9,"Jacqueline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","When the salon girl told Teresa to sit down, I thought Teresa was gonna bust a tit."
1970,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Don't you fuckin' tell me what to do! I'm a client here!
1971,14,9,"Caroline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Teresa! Calm down.
1972,14,9,Salon Girl,I don't have to take your shit! I'm from Jersey!
1973,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Get her, Sharon!"
1974,14,9,Sharon Marsh,What?
1975,14,9,"Jacqueline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Sharon, just stay out of it!"
1976,14,9,"Caroline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Be the bigger person, Sharon!"
1977,14,9,Sharon Marsh,You people are crazy.
1978,14,9,"Caroline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Who's crazy? Are you talkin' about my family?! [grabs Sharon by the hair as she screams] Is my family crazy?!
1979,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")","Don't you pull my friend's hair, you bitch! [pulls Sharon back by the hair]"
1980,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[barges in ready to fight] Let go of her, you piece of trash! [the other ladies turn to look]"
1981,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Who the fuck are you to tell ME what to do?!
1982,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,[walks up to the women] All you trashy whores get the fuck out of here and leave her alone!
1983,14,9,"Joe and Teresa Giudice (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",Psycho bitch!
1984,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"[slaps her hand away] No! You're a psycho bitch, psycho bitch! Psycho biiitch! You wanna see fuckin' crazy?! You'd better just step the fuck away or you're gonna see fuckin' crazy! [the Jersey women begin to leave]"
1985,14,9,"Jacqueline (from ""Real Housewives of New Jersey"")",[turns to look at Sheila] You're cabbage! [then leaves]
1986,14,9,Sharon Marsh,Sheila?
1987,14,9,Randy Marsh,"People of South Park! We have all noticed a steep rise in everything Jersey lately. As many of you already know, everything east of the Rockies is now part of New Jersey! The Jersey Shore now includes Jacksonville, Miami, the Gulf of Jersey Mexico, and the Jersey Islands. [this includes Puerto Rica and Cuba]"
1988,14,9,Mr Garrison,Jesus! Why are they doing this?
1989,14,9,Randy Marsh,"More people from Jersey are showing up in our town! If we don't do something, South Park is going to become West Jersey."
1990,14,9,Jimbo Kern,"Well, that does it! Let's go tell everyone from Jersey we don't want 'em here!"
1991,14,9,All,Yeah!
1992,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"That won't work. You can't just tell people from Jersey you don't like them. No matter how obnoxious they are, they will convince themselves that you all actually think they're cool."
1993,14,9,Jimbo Kern,"How do you know that, Ms. Broflovski? [Sheila is on the spot.]"
1994,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"That's when I knew I had to tell everyone the truth: that originally I'm from Jersey. [the adults present are Stephen and Linda Stotch, Randy and Sharon Marsh, Stuart McCormick, his wife, and Liane Cartman] Yes, born and raised, I wasn't even called Sheila back then. In Jersey I was known as S-Woww Tittybang. [a picture of her is shown] I drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face. [a picture of one such incident is shown] Living in South Park, I'm able to control the Jersey side of me, which doesn't really come out unless I get around other people from Jersey. [turns away from the other adults] I'm just really hoping that people here don't judge me for it, or or, somehow, you know, hold it against me."
1995,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Sheila, who are you talking to?"
1996,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,You wouldn't understand. It's a Jersey thing. [walks away]
1997,14,9,Eric Cartman,"You ain't gettin' by that way, Kenny!"
1998,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaching] Hey, dudes."
1999,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes the ball from Kenny and confronts Kyle] Oh, well, well, well. Look what the cat threw up in the litter box. Come on, guys. We don't wanna be seen hanging around him."
2000,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,What are you talking about?
2001,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we heard the news! Your mom is from Jersey!"
2002,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,So what?
2003,14,9,Eric Cartman,So what?! That makes you from Jersey!
2004,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it doesn't!"
2005,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[turns around] He's from Jersey, you guys. [inches away] Let's just get away from him."
2006,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not from Jersey. I was born here.
2007,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Don't try and deny it! You're one of them, dude. And by my account, that's strike three!"
2008,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,What's strike three?!
2009,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[takes off Kyle's hat] You're a ginger, a Jew, and from Jersey! Three strikes, Kyle! You're out!"
2010,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Shut the fuck up! [takes his hat back and puts it on, then looks at the other boys] What?"
2011,14,9,Stan Marsh,Did you know your mom was from Jersey?
2012,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why does it matter?!
2013,14,9,Stan Marsh,"No, uh, it just explains a lot."
2014,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[moves Kyle aside] Oh, my God! Kyle is even starting to look like he's from Jersey! His skin is turning orange!"
2015,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, it isn't!"
2016,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Yes, it is. It's getting oranger."
2017,14,9,Stan Marsh,"Stop it, Cartman. Just 'cause Kyle's mom is a Jersey asshole doesn't mean Kyle is."
2018,14,9,Kenny McCormick,(Yeah.)
2019,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Okay, you do what you want, guys. As for me, well, you're a heartless backstabbing Jersey boy, Kyle, and I shan't be playing basketball with the likes of you. [walks away, then turns and glares at him] And I'm gonna start crappin' on your doorstep a lot more!"
2020,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No. [removes his hat] Couldn't be. [opens the top drawer of the vanity and pulls out a pair of scissors. He begins to cut his hair, slowly, then faster and faster. He gets some styling gel and rubs it into his hair. He gets a razor out to shape his eyebrows, cuts more of his hair off, rips the sleeves off his shirt, gets a bracelet and puts it on his right forearm, gets more gel and rubs a design onto his shirt, then is shocked at what he sees in the mirror] Oh, my God."
2021,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,[knocks on the bathroom door] Kyle? You in there?
2022,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Hold on. Ah, I'm, ah... n-not right now. [goes about putting stuff away and closing all the drawers]"
2023,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, open the door."
2024,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Not now, Mom. Please."
2025,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, this instant! One, two. [Kyle goes to the door]"
2026,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, all right. [opens the door and see his mom, who's really Jerseyfied herself. He's speechless]"
2027,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,I guess we need to talk.
2028,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"I know this has to be very upsetting for you, Kyle."
2029,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[enunciating] What am I, Mom?"
2030,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"When I got pregnant with you, Kyle, your father and I were living with my parents in Newark. We knew we had to get out. Neither of us wanted our child to be from Jersey, so we moved. As far away as we could. But now I realize you can take the fetus out of Jersey, but you can't take Jersey out of the fetus."
2031,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,[getting scared] What are you saying?!
2032,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"I'm saying that for the first two months I carried you in my stomach, I lived in Newark. Technically, you are from Jersey."
2033,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,[looks at his new look] No! I don't wanna look like this!
2034,14,9,Sheila Broflovski,"It isn't so bad, Kyle. A lot of people think the Jersey look is nice."
2035,14,9,Ike Broflovski,[walks by and looks] Aaaaiiiiihhhhh! [faints on his back]
2036,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,I can hide it! [hops off the bed] Nobody ever has to know! [puts his hat back on and walks out the bedroom door] I can't ever let anybody know!
2037,14,9,Announcer,"Live from St. Louis, New Jersey! It's the ""Jersey News"" with anchormen P-Train and Tan Jovi!"
2038,14,9,P Train,"What's up, New Jersey? It's the evenin' news. Our top story tonight: many Jersey people are freakin' pissed after a small town in Colorado got all aggro on some decent Jersey folk! For more on this story we go to Chicago."
2039,14,9,Reporter,"People here in Chicago, New Jersey are riled up, P-Train. Apparently, a town called South Park, which is at the border of Denver, New Jersey, is discriminating against people from Jersey! They won't sell houses to people from Jersey, and they're making all the ones who moved in move out. [the Giudice family is forcibly hauled out of their new home and stuffed into their car] And they're takin' down all the Jersey-owned shops! [South Park Salon is bombed and everyone in there runs out] It's like these people got a beef with Jersey. What's up with that?!"
2040,14,9,Tan Jovi,What's up with that?!
2041,14,9,P Train,What's up with that?!
2042,14,9,Tan Jovi,"Well, we are coming after you, South Park! We fight discrimination! It's a Jersey thing!"
2043,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Please, Governor. You have to send your troops to join us in this fight. We're just a small town. We can't stop New Jersey on our own."
2044,14,9,Arnold Schwarzenegger,"Ve are very sore-y, but Cal-i-for-ni-a cannot afford helping you at this time."
2045,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Can't you see that if we fall to New Jersey, California is next?"
2046,14,9,Arnold Schwarzenegger,"No, because U-tah is between Colo-rah-do and Cal-i-for-ni-a."
2047,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh. Fine! But when Utah gets taken over by New Jersey, who's next?!"
2048,14,9,Arnold Schwarzenegger,Nevada.
2049,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Oh, really? Well, okay, Mr. I'm-Awesome-at-Geography!"
2050,14,9,Eric Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?!
2051,14,9,Stan Marsh,Tryin' to help. My dad says to distribute all these guns.
2052,14,9,Eric Cartman,[points to Kyle] And we're just gonna let him stand around here?! He's one of them. He could easily be a spy!
2053,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"I told you Cartman, I'm not one of them! I don't wanna live in West Jersey any more than you do!"
2054,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Overcompensating a little, aren't we, Kyle?!"
2055,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,That's enough!
2056,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Your blood is tainted with the three J's! Jewish, Jersey and Ginger! Admit it!"
2057,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Aaaarrghhhhhh! [runs at Cartman and pins him hard against a tree] I'm not one of them! Do you understand me?! You'd better get that through your fat head! I will never be one of them, and if you say it again, I swear to God, I'll smash your fucking teeth in! [lets go and walks away angrily. Cartman backs up a bit without saying a word, then breaks down]"
2058,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[Whining] That hurt my throat because he pushed it right here, and then the back of my head hit the treeee! There was... there was... there was bark, and it scratched it! [Stan and Kenny walk away silently] Did you see the scratch, Keeenney?!"
2059,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Please, Emperor Akishino! We need Japan's help to fight these people! [waits for an answer] Fine! But you Japs will all be eatin' hoagies in a month! [throws his cell phone away and claps his hands free of it] That's it, nobody's gonna help us! We're on our own!"
2060,14,9,Stuart McCormick,We can't take on all of Jersey. We have to find support.
2061,14,9,Randy Marsh,"There is no support! Every ally America ever had is... [thinks of something] Wait a minute. [strokes his chin] Sometimes when a threat is great enough, you have to turn to your enemies for help."
2062,14,9,Mr Garrison,What are you talking about?
2063,14,9,Randy Marsh,We could ask Al Qaeda.
2064,14,9,Stephen Stotch,[steps forward] Ask Al Qaeda for help? After what they did to us?!
2065,14,9,Randy Marsh,Maybe it's time we put our differences aside and forgive them.
2066,14,9,Stephen Stotch,"And what about the families of the victims of 9/11? Their feelings matter for another ten months, damn it!"
2067,14,9,Bar Patron 1,"Hey! Hey, we got a problem! You've gotta get some people down to the bar quick! There's trouble!"
2068,14,9,Randy Marsh,People from Jersey?
2069,14,9,Bar Patron 1,I don't know what the hell I saw.
2070,14,9,Skeeter,It tore a hole in my meat locker. Smashed the cigarette machine in half.
2071,14,9,Officer Barbrady,"Alright, come out now. Make it easy on yourself. [a soft, high growl is heard and a figure runs by in the shadows, bumping into a few tables. The figure runs by again, grunting. The flashlights follow the sound and find a woman who looks like a troll cowering in a corner. Her arms are really short, her ears are elfin, her skin is orange]"
2072,14,9,Bar Patron 2,"It's one of them! That thing's from Jersey, too! [the thing moves closer to the ATM and smokes]"
2073,14,9,Randy Marsh,What is it?
2074,14,9,Bar Patron 2,It's called a Snooki. It's very famous. [Snooki sips from her drink and eats straight out of a pickle jar]
2075,14,9,Randy Marsh,That thing is famous? Why?
2076,14,9,Bar Patron 2,I don't know!
2077,14,9,Jimbo Kern,"Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's kill it! [aims his shotgun and fires at her. She drops the pickle jar and it shatters.]"
2078,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",[walking away from the ATM] Snooo-ki.
2079,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Don't let it get away! Where is it?! [hears a sound] Who was that?! [his beam lands on Snooki, who has taken Stephen Stotch down and is raping him]"
2080,14,9,Stephen Stotch,Aaagh! Get it off of me!
2081,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",[raping him] Snooki smoosh.
2082,14,9,Stephen Stotch,"Shoot it! [another gunshot is heard and Snooki heads for a window and jumps out through it, running away]"
2083,14,9,Eric Cartman,"So then he grabs my throat, right? And he slams my head into a tree! And then he screams, ""I'll smash your teeth in!"" My head is all like gashed open."
2084,14,9,Butters Stotch,Kyle did that? Gee whiz.
2085,14,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm telling you guys, he's getting worse. The Jersey in Kyle is coming out. I don't see any other choice. We have to kidnap Kyle and lock him in the meat freezer at Sizzler. [Kyle is cleaning his rifle nearby and lifts his head to see what the other boys are doing] Hey, Kyle. 'Sup? Kind of nice out tonight, huh? [Kyle returns to cleaning his rifle. Cartman then moves to the opposite side of the circle] He has to be put away, and he has to be put away now!"
2086,14,9,Butters Stotch,Are you being serious?
2087,14,9,Eric Cartman,"This is very serious, Butters."
2088,14,9,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, but lockin' Kyle in a meat freezer? I mean, he could die."
2089,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Well if he does, too bad! Did you see the scratch on my head?! [Kyle looks up again. Cartman notices and turns to look back at him] Hey, Kyle. [stretches] Uhh. Dude, do you smell raspberries? I smell raspberries. Ho? Huh. [turns around and goes into a low voice as Kyle watches from nearby] We need to do this now. At some point, he might start suspecting something's up."
2090,14,9,Operative,"[walks up to bin Laden with a package] Istagia makuman? [bin Laden turns around and takes the package, which is a video tape. He puts it into a tape player and watches the video. Randy pops up onscreen]"
2091,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Hello, Mr. bin Laden. My name is Randy, and I'm a geologist in America. I know that America isn't your favorite place in the world, but gosh darn it, we need your help. As you may know, we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming New Jersey. I believe that if we do not succeed, Jersey will spread to Japan, Russia, and eventually, to you. I know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime, Mr. bin Laden, and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind. Well, now I ask you to watch this. [Jersey Shore's live-action show open begins to play]"
2092,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",Neaaaaaah! Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
2093,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Come on, you guys, hurry!"
2094,14,9,Stan Marsh,"[climbs in behind him] Cartman, what the hell are we doing at Sizzler?"
2095,14,9,Eric Cartman,"I told you guys, you're not gonna believe it. It's a miracle!"
2096,14,9,Kenny McCormick,[climbs in behind Stan] (What kind of fuckin' miracle?!) [Kyle climbs in last]
2097,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[leads them to a spot] Jesus answered our prayers, you guys. It's so cool. [stops] It's right there in the meat locker. Kyle, go check it out."
2098,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,[looks at Cartman for a few seconds] Why?
2099,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, go see why. It's a Jesus miracle!"
2100,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,You just wanna lock me in there because you think I'm one of them.
2101,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Nuh uh. Seriously, nuh uh."
2102,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not going in any meat locker so you can trap me!
2103,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Trap you? No, no, Kyle, it's actually... lights! [the lights go on and the fourth graders Cartman was talking to earlier pop into view] Ha-ha! It's a trap, Kyle! Get him to the meat locker! [the group of six come up and take Kyle away]"
2104,14,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what are you doing?"
2105,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[stops Stan and Kenny in their tracks] Back away, guys, this is for the safety of all of us. [rushes up to the freezer door] Sorry Kyle, but you can't be trusted."
2106,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine, Cartman! You really want me to go in there, I'll... [his expression changes quickly] Dude, Cartman, what is that behind you?"
2107,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, do we really have to resort to that?!"
2108,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"No, I- I'm serious. What is that behind you?"
2109,14,9,Eric Cartman,You ginger Jersey Jew! [Snooki rises up behind him] Your tactics don't work on me!
2110,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
2111,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[looks over his shoulder, then looks back at the other boys] Dude, what the fuck is that thing behind me?"
2112,14,9,Stephen Stotch,"Garrison, I think the Jersey people are advancing. Where's Randy?"
2113,14,9,Mr Garrison,He's still questioning that new prisoner.
2114,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Alright, Mr. Situation, we'll try this again! Why are you people doing this?!"
2115,14,9,"The Situation (from ""Jersey Shore"")","Well, I told you, it's, uh, just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him hard on the left cheek]"
2116,14,9,Randy Marsh,What does that mean?!
2117,14,9,"The Situation (from ""Jersey Shore"")","You just don't understand. It's, uh, it's just... just a Jersey thing. [Randy punches him again, kicks him with the left foot, punches him with the left hand, kicks him on the side of his head with the right foot]"
2118,14,9,Randy Marsh,Stop playing stupid!
2119,14,9,Jimbo Kern,"Maybe he really is stupid, Randy."
2120,14,9,Randy Marsh,[shoots back at Jimbo] Nobody's this stupid! [turns to The Situation again] What are you people planning?!
2121,14,9,"The Situation (from ""Jersey Shore"")","It's just a Jersey thing, you know? You...you just gotta be from Jersey to get it. [Randy punches him again with the left hand, kicks him with the left foot, delivers a roundhouse kick with the right foot, flips over him and kicks him on the back of the head]"
2122,14,9,Gerald Broflovski,[keeping a lookout atop the barricade] Here they come! [the adults get into position]
2123,14,9,Sharon Marsh,"Is it them, Randy?"
2124,14,9,Randy Marsh,Yup. They're from Jersey alright.
2125,14,9,Jersey People,Yeah! Woo-hoo! Let's go! Yeah!
2126,14,9,Jersey Man 2,Let's go creepin' in this town!
2127,14,9,Jersey Woman,[to another woman] Don't you talk about my family! Don't you talk about my family!
2128,14,9,Randy Marsh,This is where we make our stand! South Park will never be West Jersey! [some people cheer]
2129,14,9,Randy Marsh,"Fuck New Jersey! [some people cheer and begin firing. The advancing Jersey folk begin to fall one by one] Keep shooting! We're sick of you, Jersey!"
2130,14,9,DogPoo Petuski,[Screaming] Ugh! Ugh! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!
2131,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")",Snooki wants smoosh smoosh.
2132,14,9,Stan Marsh,"[tries to get out, but finds the doors locked] Try to find a way past it!"
2133,14,9,Eric Cartman,What does it want?!
2134,14,9,Butters Stotch,Sounds like it wants smoosh smoosh.
2135,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")","[leaves DogPoo, reaches Cartman, and starts raping him from behind] Smoosh smoosh. Snooki wants smoosh smoosh."
2136,14,9,Eric Cartman,"No! You guys, it's raping me! It's raping me!"
2137,14,9,Stan Marsh,"Jesus Christ, what the hell do we do?"
2138,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, God. [gets a grabs his head and stumbles away, then falls on all fours] Wuh. Aah. Get out of here!"
2139,14,9,Stan Marsh,[flatly] Why? [Kyle continues writhing and throws his hat away]
2140,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Agggh! Agggh! [pulls out a tube of gel and puts some on his left hand] No! [quickly greases up his hair, takes off his jacket, rolls up his sleeves, puts on a necklace, combs his hair, puts on rings on his left hand, and writes ""KYLeY-B"" on his T-shirt]"
2141,14,9,Stan Marsh,Dude.
2142,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[approaches Snooki; in Jersey accent] Get out of here, you piece of garbage! You wanna smoosh, go creepin' somewheres else!"
2143,14,9,"Snooki (from ""Jersey Shore"")","Snooki just, uh, smoosh in the... the tenth..."
2144,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,You're garbage! You know that?! You're cabbage! [Snooki babbles and says her name] You've got cabbage in your muff! [Snooki continues babbling] You've got cabbage in your fuckin' muff! [Snooki continues babbling and Kyle finally fells her with a left hook. Snooki cries and escapes through a window. Cartman sobs a bit and puts his pants up]
2145,14,9,Eric Cartman,"[Sniffling] Thank you, Kyle."
2146,14,9,Jimbo Kern,That's the last of it! We're out of ammo!
2147,14,9,Randy Marsh,Then we've got to start falling back to Utah!
2148,14,9,Stuart McCormick,What's the point? Can't you see it's over? [the sound of roaring jets is heard and grows louder]
2149,14,9,Jimbo Kern,Who is that?! [thirteen planes appear over the horizon]
2150,14,9,Randy Marsh,"It's Al Qaeda! [cheers go up from the crowd. An Al Qaeda pilot salutes from his cockpit. Soon they're diving their planes into the Jersey crowd and killing the Jersey folk] Give 'em hell, Al Qaeda! [More cheers go up from the crowd]"
2151,14,9,Randy Marsh,"On a cold October night, a small town in Colorado stood up to New Jersey and finally said, ""Go away!"" Our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now, New Jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came. Our country's getting back to normal, and we owe it all to Osama bin Laden. [bin Laden is shown seated on a chair. Cheers go up and Randy places a garland on him, and kisses him on the cheek]"
2152,14,9,Stan Marsh,"Well, Kyle, looks like you're totally back to normal."
2153,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. The more distance between me and the others from Jersey, the better I feel."
2154,14,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, but you still have it in you. You saved my life, Kyle. Deep down inside, you're a monster. [Pinches Kyle's cheek] But you're my little monster."
2155,14,9,Stan Marsh,"I just have one question, Kyle. At Sizzler when you were yelling ""Muff cabbage,"" what's muff cabbage?"
2156,14,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's a, uh, it's a Jersey thing."
2157,14,9,Randy Marsh,"On this day let us all remember that no people on this earth are really enemies, only folks with differences. [a paratrooper descends from the rafters and quickly kills bin Laden with one shot]"
2158,14,9,Paratrooper,"[to his pilot] Tango is down, tango is down."
2159,14,9,Randy Marsh,We got him!
2160,14,10,Eric Cartman,"So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy's mouth. [laughs heartily. Butters approaches the table with a sheet of paper]"
2161,14,10,Butters Stotch,"Hey Stan, I have a note for you."
2162,14,10,Stan Marsh,A note?
2163,14,10,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, uh, Wendy said to give you this. [hands him the note] I'm like a mailman. [walks away. Stan reads and Kyle notices]"
2164,14,10,Kyle Broflovski,What's it say?
2165,14,10,Stan Marsh,[omitting the names] We need to talk.
2166,14,10,Eric Cartman,"[voice rising in pitch] Ohhhhhhhh. When a chick says ""We need to talk"" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls, dude."
2167,14,10,Red,"Are you sure he has a problem, Wendy?"
2168,14,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Yes. I've read all about it. It's a real disease. It's called ""hoarding."" People who can't throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can't take it anymore."
2169,14,10,Stan Marsh,"[approaching] Is something wrong, Wendy? [Wendy sees him, then looks at the girls, gets up and walks up to Stan]"
2170,14,10,Wendy Testaburger,[sighs] Stan? We need to talk about your locker.
2171,14,10,Stan Marsh,My locker?
2172,14,10,Wendy Testaburger,[turns away] Every time I see the condition it's in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.
2173,14,10,Stan Marsh,Are you serious?
2174,14,10,Wendy Testaburger,[turns back] It's so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you've been asking to keep things in my locker.
2175,14,10,Stan Marsh,Well it's just a little messy.
2176,14,10,Wendy Testaburger,"No, Stan, it's called ""hoarding""! And if you don't get help I don't know how much longer I could be with you!"
2177,14,10,Stan Marsh,Aw come on.
2178,14,10,Wendy Testaburger,Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?
2179,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, alright."
2180,14,10,Wendy Testaburger,"[wipes a tear from her eye] Okay. [puts a hand on his shoulder] I've hired some experts to help you with this. We'll make this as easy as possible on you, Stan."
2181,14,10,An Expert,"Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I'm a hoarding specialist, and today we're gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let's go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan. [Stan goes to his locker, opens it, and a few items fall out. The class gasps in horror: Stan's locker is truly packed. Wendy cries and hides her face with her notebook]"
2182,14,10,Stan Marsh,"What, come on, it's not that bad."
2183,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Now, as part of Stan's therapy, we need to make sure we don't throw away anything he doesn't want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out."
2184,14,10,Stan Marsh,"My psychosis? Look, it isn't that big a deal, I'll just throw this stuff away."
2185,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"[walks up to Stan and gets down on one knee] Okay, great. How about we start with this? [takes a small box out of the locker]"
2186,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, no, that's my pencil box. I need my pencil box."
2187,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"[defers right away, putting a hand up] Okay, okay, we'll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this? [takes out a bent toothbrush] Broken toothbrush."
2188,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well... it's good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-"
2189,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,But it's broken.
2190,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-"
2191,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"[defers right away] Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box. [sets it down] Now how about this? [pulls out a clear sandwich bag with rotten food in it] Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots."
2192,14,10,Class,Eeeeewwww! [two more men stand behind the class holding trash bags and wearing face masks]
2193,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let's, let's just keep that."
2194,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"It's full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?"
2195,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-"
2196,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?"
2197,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, I- I guess so, but- [Dr. Chinstrap dumps the baggie into the large trash bag his assistant is holding. The assistant is wearing a facemask] Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? [Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny look at each other worriedly]"
2198,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?
2199,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well no, don't throw that out."
2200,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? [sweeps out a bunch of loose papers. Stan gets alarmed]"
2201,14,10,Stan Marsh,"[begins gathering up the papers] No, because there could be something written on one of them that's important and uh-! No, don't take my empty bottle-! [takes the bottle from Dr. Chinstrap. The assistant pulls out the baggie] G-give me back my sandwich! [Stan grabs the baggie, then reaches for another loose sheet, when he realizes what he's done. Cartman makes a circle around his right ear with his index finger and whistles a cuckoo tune]"
2202,14,10,Kyle Broflovski,[walks up to Stan and puts a hand on his left shoulder] Dude. What's wrong with you?
2203,14,10,Stan Marsh,I don't... I don't know.
2204,14,10,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.
2205,14,10,Mr Mackey,"Stan, as your counselor, I'm here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m'kay? Now, what is the matter? [before Stan answers, he looks around the office. Mr. Mackey has a lot of junk in there]"
2206,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, my friends are worried that I'm showing signs of... ""hoarding."""
2207,14,10,Mr Mackey,"Hoarding? M'kay, what's that?"
2208,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well, apparently, it's when you... don't throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?"
2209,14,10,Mr Mackey,"Hmmm, I haven't heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m'kay?"
2210,14,10,Stan Marsh,"[looks around again] Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?"
2211,14,10,Mr Mackey,"Me? ...Like, like what?"
2212,14,10,Stan Marsh,"[looks around and picks up an empty milk carton from a box] Well like, you've got an old milk carton here from a month ago that's like-"
2213,14,10,Mr Mackey,DON'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKIN' MOUTH! M'KAY?!
2214,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"There's no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he's easily a Class-3."
2215,14,10,Principal Victoria,But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?
2216,14,10,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, our son has always been fairly clean."
2217,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"We don't know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it's okay with you, we'd like to run some tests on the both of them."
2218,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Is that really necessary for Stan? It's just his locker.
2219,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"I don't know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is. [turns away] It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats."
2220,14,10,Randy Marsh,"Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He's been hoarding animals for years now."
2221,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Oh no, really?"
2222,14,10,Sgt Yates,"Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep."
2223,14,10,Mr Yelman,"[a shepherd, or sheep herder, or sheep hoarder] ...Well I, that is I, I-"
2224,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"It's okay, Mr. Yelman, I'm a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. [Mr. Yelman doesn't know what they're talking about]"
2225,14,10,Partner,"Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful."
2226,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it's office hoarding, or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals."
2227,14,10,Mr Yelman,"Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder."
2228,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"It's pronounced ""hoarder,"" and yes you are."
2229,14,10,Mr Yelman,"But but I, uh I'm actually herding sheep."
2230,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Yes, you are hurting sheep by hoarding them, aren't you? It's good you realize that."
2231,14,10,Mr Yelman,"No, but I just thought that-"
2232,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Now listen: there's a psychological reason you're all doing this, and we're gonna get to the bottom of it. We're gonna do some regression therapy. I'll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past."
2233,14,10,Mr Mackey,"M'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uh-kay?"
2234,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. float- [jumps out of his chair suddenly, startling the subjects] WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!"
2235,14,10,Mr Mackey,"What?! What?! Jesus, what?!"
2236,14,10,Mr Yelman,Oh my God!
2237,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second. [clears his throat] Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... now the cloud is near you, you... you reach out to it."
2238,14,10,Mr Mackey,[stretches his arm out] Mmm-kay...
2239,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"It's the cloud of your memories, of your past, [focus on Mr. Mackey] ...your childhood perhaps, ...what do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?"
2240,14,10,Mr Mackey,"Billy, ...Billy Thompson?"
2241,14,10,Billy,"There he is! Hey, Mackey! [Mr. Mackey, talking to two other boys, suddenly drops his books and turns around]"
2242,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m'kay?"
2243,14,10,Billy,Come 'ere! [points to the spot where he wants Mackey. Mackey's friends panic and split]
2244,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Uh well, actually I need to get home, m'kay? I uh..."
2245,14,10,Billy,You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.
2246,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh well uh, uh... smoking's bad, uhkay? [Billy throws him up against a locker] Huhhhhh!"
2247,14,10,Billy,"You're gonna die Mackey! [to his friends] Hold his legs! [his friends move in, but Mackey gets loose and runs away, screaming. Mackey rounds a corner, finds a room, and goes in before Billy could catch him. Billy and his friends round the corner and run past the room Mackey entered] Come back here!"
2248,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"[in the darkness, starts to calm down] Okay. Okay, okay okay, it's okay. It's okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light. [turns on the light, revealing Stan]"
2249,14,10,Stan Marsh,"What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?"
2250,14,10,Mr. Mackey,Shh. Be quiet.
2251,14,10,Mr Yelman,"'Scuse me, where are we?"
2252,14,10,Mr. Mackey,Shh. You've gotta be quiet. Billy Thompson's out there.
2253,14,10,Stan Marsh,What the hell's going on?!
2254,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,What the hell is going on?!
2255,14,10,Partner,The counselor's flat top readers are calculating with the boy's and the sheep hoarder's.
2256,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,Oh Jesus.
2257,14,10,Randy Marsh,What does that mean?
2258,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,It means Mr. Mackey's childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.
2259,14,10,Randy Marsh,What?!
2260,14,10,Partner,I'm afraid your son has gone into his counselor's dream.
2261,14,10,Randy Marsh,"Aw come on, that's stupid. How's that, how's that even possible?"
2262,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"It's not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I'll provide the background."
2263,14,10,Pinkerton,"Alright. [walks up to Randy and Sharon] Look, it is possible to enter into someone else's dreams. [Dr. Chinstrap begins a musical accompaniment] Send dream trackers to go into a person's subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who's dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back. [Dr. Chinstrap ends his accompaniment at the same time]"
2264,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Yay, my bedroom! Yep, this is my happy place, m'kay?"
2265,14,10,Stan Marsh,Mr. Mackey.
2266,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"[sees his Lite Brite, runs to work on it, and sings] Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m'kay."
2267,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?"
2268,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Well this is a Lite Brite, m'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m'kay, clowns, m'kay."
2269,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Come on, dude, you've gotta wake up!"
2270,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll! [goes to his dresser and grabs it] I can take the motorcycle, hm'kay, I put it on this thing, like this. [puts the motorcycle on the little ramp] Okay now crank it back, and now I let go. [releases the motorcycle, which zooms across the room and does a wheelie. Mackey giggles with excitement] Okay. Okay."
2271,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn't for me."
2272,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Hey, look what's on! It's ZOOM!"
2273,14,10,Mr Yelman,"Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep."
2274,14,10,Stan Marsh,I'm working on it!
2275,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"[Singing along with the TV] Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass. Oooh two ooone three fouuur, m'kay!"
2276,14,10,Stan Marsh,"[walks up to Mackey and turns him around] Dude, please wake up! You're a grown man in a psychiatrist's office! [something hits Mackey's window and he goes to see what it was. He sees Billy on the sidewalk with his friends]"
2277,14,10,Billy,"You can hide in your house for now, Mackey, but tomorrow is the field trip! Frisco Woods! And I'm gonna do things to you you'll never forget!"
2278,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"No, uh Billy, please, uh-kay? I'm really sorry about the smoking thing, uh."
2279,14,10,Billy,"See you in the woods tomorrow, dead man! [walks away with his friends]"
2280,14,10,Mr. Mackey,[turns away from the window] Oh Jesus...
2281,14,10,Stan Marsh,Is that why we're here? Did something really bad happen on the field trip?
2282,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Yeah, it's probably gonna be bad, m'kay. [looks away]"
2283,14,10,Stan Marsh,Oh-Ohhhhhhh.
2284,14,10,Mr Mackey,"Ohhhhhhh, m'kay."
2285,14,10,Randy Marsh,"What kind of hoarding specialist are you?! You trapped our son in his counselor's subconscious, and now you're saying he could die in there?!"
2286,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted to have happen."
2287,14,10,Randy Marsh,That does it! [goes into the lab]
2288,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,What are you doing?!
2289,14,10,Randy Marsh,"I'm goin' in! [pulls up a couch next to Stan's] If they're locked into his regression, then maybe I can be too!"
2290,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,Are you crazy?! Mackey is in a very unstable state!
2291,14,10,Randy Marsh,Damn your incongruities! [hooks himself up] I'm goin' in after my son!
2292,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,It's a dream world where Mackey can imagine himself to be anything. It's dangerous!
2293,14,10,Randy Marsh,I said get me in there!
2294,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Alright, you wanna risk your ass?! Fine! [snaps into a soothing rush job] You see a cloud, it's a fluffy cloud, floating, happy, happy fluffy cloud. You reach out to it."
2295,14,10,Randy Marsh,Ahhh.
2296,14,10,Bus Driver,"Alright kids, everyone on the bus."
2297,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Wait wait, where the hell are we now?"
2298,14,10,Mr. Mackey,It's the day of the big field trip.
2299,14,10,Billy,"[from the bus window] Come on, Mackey. We're waitin' for ya."
2300,14,10,Mr. Mackey,Oh Jesus.
2301,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up! I don't belong here! I need to have my own regression therapy!"
2302,14,10,Bus Driver,Everyone on the bus now! We're runnin' late!
2303,14,10,Mr Yelman,"Excuse me, I'm actually a sheep herder."
2304,14,10,Bus Driver,"It's pronounced ""hoarder,"" young man, and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it! [shoves him into the bus]"
2305,14,10,Mr Yelman,"Yes, but I, I'm so- wah- um."
2306,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Please, I don't wanna go on your field trip, Mackey."
2307,14,10,Randy Marsh,Stan? [Stan looks around] Stan!
2308,14,10,Stan Marsh,Dad? Is that you?
2309,14,10,Randy Marsh,"Yes, it's me, Stan."
2310,14,10,Stan Marsh,Where are you?
2311,14,10,Randy Marsh,It's me! Up here! [Stan looks up and sees him] I'm a butterfly!
2312,14,10,Stan Marsh,"The hell are you doing, dad?"
2313,14,10,Randy Marsh,I'm flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings!
2314,14,10,Stan Marsh,Did you come here to help me?
2315,14,10,Randy Marsh,"I was gonna, but ooh! This is fun!"
2316,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you gotta stop Mackey and bring us back to reality!"
2317,14,10,Randy Marsh,"Butterflies have no concern for such things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterly poon."
2318,14,10,Stan Marsh,DAD!
2319,14,10,Randy Marsh,[moaning happily] Aah ahhh aha ahhh.
2320,14,10,Stan Marsh,[moaning in frustration] Aaaaaagh!
2321,14,10,Pinkerton,"Uh oh, something's wrong."
2322,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,What is it?!
2323,14,10,Pinkerton,The father. He's gone completely off chart.
2324,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Off chart? What does that mean?
2325,14,10,Pinkerton,We don't even know.
2326,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,I told him not to go into the dream after his son. He should have waited for the experts to get here.
2327,14,10,Sharon Marsh,"Who are the experts? [five men shooting guns enter the observation room, and one of them goes down with a gunshot wound]"
2328,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,Get that door closed! Keep me covered! [the expert in striped shirt shuts the door]
2329,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Ah good, you're here."
2330,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,What's the sitch?!
2331,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Four people, in there, all stuck in the middle one's dream."
2332,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),We need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them!
2333,14,10,Sharon Marsh,What next dream level?
2334,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,Alright look. Right now they're all trapped in a dream. [Dr. Chinstrap resumes the accompaniment] We need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream.
2335,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Why?
2336,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),[Black Suit (Arthur)] Because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo.
2337,14,10,Sharon Marsh,What's that?
2338,14,10,Expert 2 (Eames),[in striped shirt (Eames)] Empty scary dreamspace.
2339,14,10,Sharon Marsh,So like a nightmare?
2340,14,10,Expert 3 (Yusef),"[African-American (Yusef)] No, like a nightmare within a nightmare!"
2341,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Why can't you wake up from that?
2342,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),"You can, but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare!"
2343,14,10,Sharon Marsh,That doesn't sound very difficult.
2344,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),It is!
2345,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Why?
2346,14,10,Expert 4 (Saito),Arrgh.
2347,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),We don't have time for this!
2348,14,10,Sharon Marsh,"Uh okay, fine. So you're gonna take my son to a dream within a dream, and then what?"
2349,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),Then we go into your husband's dreams!
2350,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Okaaay...
2351,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,But your husband will think we're in Hasselback's dream.
2352,14,10,Sharon Marsh,"Okay, wait. Who's Hasselback?"
2353,14,10,Matt Hasselback,I am.
2354,14,10,Sharon Marsh,"Okay. Wait, no. Why do we need a football player?"
2355,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,"Sometimes, thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains!"
2356,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream?
2357,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,"Not all the time, just this once. And maybe one other time."
2358,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),It's so complex and cool.
2359,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool! Going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea!
2360,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,You just don't get it 'cause you're not smart enough. Let's move! [the five experts and Hasselback enter the lab and hook themselves up]
2361,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Will they be able to wake Mackey up?
2362,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"If they don't, it'll be the end of Europe as we know it."
2363,14,10,Sharon Marsh,Why?
2364,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,Because.
2365,14,10,Ranger Pete,"Hello kids, my name is Ranger Pete."
2366,14,10,Class,Hi Ranger Pete.
2367,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Hi Ranger Pete, m'kay."
2368,14,10,Ranger Pete,Today we're gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem.
2369,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh that should be fun, m'kay. [looks at Billy, who looks back and punches his right palm with his left fist. His voice trembles] Ahhhh..."
2370,14,10,Ranger Pete,But first we have a very special guest. It's Woodsy Owl. [Woodsy !Owl skips into view]
2371,14,10,Mr. Mackey,Oh boy! Woodsy Owl!
2372,14,10,Stan Marsh,Who's that?
2373,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"""Give a hoot, don't pollute,"" m'kay."
2374,14,10,Woodsy Owl,"Hi, I'm Woodsy Owl, remindin' you all to please pick up your trash, and keep our forests clean. In the city or in the woods,"
2375,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Help keep Americaaa lookin' good, m'kay. [claps] Oh, boy I love that song."
2376,14,10,Ranger Pete,"Alright kids, time to split up and go into the forest. Let's divide you all up into groups of six."
2377,14,10,Billy,We wanna be in Mackey's group!
2378,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh no, that that's m'kay. We'll uh we'll get paired with someone else uh."
2379,14,10,Ranger Pete,That's fine. You six boys can team up and be our first group in.
2380,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh no, oh God here it comes, unkay? [Stan looks at the ranger, then hears gunfire, so he turns to see where it's from. The group of experts is seen chasing and shooting at Butterfly Randy]"
2381,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,"Is this the dream, or the dream within the dream?"
2382,14,10,Expert 2 (Eames),I think it's the dream inside the Matrix inside the dream!
2383,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,Oh well. Just keep shooting!
2384,14,10,Stan Marsh,What the fuck?
2385,14,10,An Expert,Mommy? Mommy?
2386,14,10,Fire Captain,[turns to Dr. Chinstrap] So you're saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one person's dream?
2387,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Yes, and so that's why I called the fire department. I don't know where else to turn."
2388,14,10,Fireman 1,"But, wait, if those people got stuck in there, why wouldn't we?"
2389,14,10,Pinkerton,"It's very simple: You see, [Dr. Chinstrap provides accompaniment once again] when the dream experts go in, they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream."
2390,14,10,Fireman 1,Like a taco within a taco?
2391,14,10,Fire Captain,A double-decker taco supreme.
2392,14,10,Pinkerton,"Exactly. But only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels, and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other people's dreams."
2393,14,10,Fire Captain,"Wait wait whoa whoa, how can you take a ladder into a dream? [Dr. Chinstrap continues his accompaniment, this time pulling a lamb by its tail and including its bleat]"
2394,14,10,Pinkerton,Because the firemen dreams aren't like dreams at all. They're more like a dream within a matrix within a dream.
2395,14,10,Pizza Man,Somebody order a pizza?
2396,14,10,Pinkerton,No.
2397,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,Probably one of them in the dream.
2398,14,10,Pizza Man,"[determined] Alright, I'm goin' in. [goes into the lab. He goes to the first expert's couch, lays down next to him, and hooks himself up]"
2399,14,10,Pinkerton,"Look, if we can get the fire department into the counselor's dream, then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels. That way we'll be in the counselor's deepest level of subconscious."
2400,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"And it will be like a taco, inside a taco, within a Taco Bell, that's inside a KFC, within a mall, that's INSIDE YOUR BRAIN! [provides his own accompaniment]"
2401,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Aaaaaah! Not again, m'kay! Aaaaaah!"
2402,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Mackey, stop running!"
2403,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"But, but they're gonna kick my butt, m'kay! [stops briefly, then runs again] They're gonna kick it bad!"
2404,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Look, dude! [catches up to Mackey and stops him] Whatever happened with those bullies, you just have to stop running and face it! It's just a dream dude! You can control what happens. Stand up to them this time."
2405,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"I know what about? I don't remember what they did. I just remember the field trip being really bad, okay."
2406,14,10,Billy,There he is! You can't run forever!
2407,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god... [Mr. Yelman catches up]"
2408,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Mackey, go, and face it! Please. So that we can get out of here and find out why we're hoarding."
2409,14,10,Mr Yelman,But I literally herd sheep.
2410,14,10,Stan Marsh,Shut up!
2411,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Okay. Okay, I can do this. I'm just gonna stand and, and face what happens, okay?"
2412,14,10,Pizza Man,Somebody... order pizza? Pizza?
2413,14,10,Pinkerton,Mr. Mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic.
2414,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Alright, that does it. [goes to the coat hanger and grabs his coat] Get your coat."
2415,14,10,Pinkerton,Where are we going?
2416,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,We need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world.
2417,14,10,Pinkerton,You don't mean...
2418,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Hello, Freddy. [the bogeyman turns around and it's Freddy Krueger, now with a full beard and mustache] You're looking healthy."
2419,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,Chinstrap! What happened? You run out of stoolies to do your work?
2420,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Alright, look, we're in a pickle again and we need your help. Got some people trapped inside a dream."
2421,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,Told you a long time ago: I gave that up. [resumes splitting wood]
2422,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,There's some good men stuck in there.
2423,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,"[stops and turns around, exasperated] I said I'm done with it! [the cabin door and a woman with two kids appears in the doorway]"
2424,14,10,Woman,"Everything all right, Fred?"
2425,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,"It's fine, Peg. Get back in the house. [Peg tugs at her kids and they all go back inside]"
2426,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,Wife and kids.
2427,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,No thanks to you.
2428,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,We need ya Fred.
2429,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,Like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the Russians?!
2430,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,We had a country to protect!
2431,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,Protect it yourselves this time.
2432,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Dammit I'm not working for the military anymore, Krueger!"
2433,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,Then you should have no problem covering it up. [resumes splitting wood]
2434,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"[a few seconds later] Some of those trapped are firemen. Public servants, innocent in all of this."
2435,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,"[stops, sighs, and throws his axe away] Alright, fine."
2436,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Alright Billy, I'm not gonna let you hurt me this time, hm'kay? This time I'm gonna stand up for myself!"
2437,14,10,Billy,You? Gonna fight back? I don't think so! [Stan and Mr. Yelman look on]
2438,14,10,Stan Marsh,You can do it Mr. Mackey.
2439,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Go ahead and do your worst, Billy. I'm facing you head-on, m'kay?"
2440,14,10,Billy,Alright Mackey. Take this. [rears his right arm back and is about to deliver a punch when a gunshot kills him. A second gunshot hits him for good measure. The five experts converge on Billy and his friends and shoot them thoroughly]
2441,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,Get the perimeter secure! Make sure they're dead!
2442,14,10,Stan Marsh,What the hell?
2443,14,10,Expert 2 (Eames),We got 'em! The bad memories are dead.
2444,14,10,Fire Captain,"[through his bullhorn] Alright everyone, this is the fire department. Do not panic."
2445,14,10,Stan Marsh,Who are you people?
2446,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,We came here to rescue you from the bad guys in Mackey's dream.
2447,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Well uh, wouldn't it be better to have Mackey face them on his own?"
2448,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),"No. As long as the source of the drama is wiped out, the counselor can wake up."
2449,14,10,Expert 2 (Eames),Right. [nothing happens]
2450,14,10,Stan Marsh,...So then why aren't we waking up?
2451,14,10,Expert 2 (Eames),Unless... the bullies aren't the source of the counselor's bad memory.
2452,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"Hey that's right. The bullies didn't even beat me up that day. I, I ran away from them."
2453,14,10,Expert 2 (Eames),"[strokes the back of his neck with his left hand] Oh, whoops."
2454,14,10,Mr. Mackey,[begins to walk away] I remember. [walks to a small shack nearby] I ran and I ran and I hid in this building here. And somebody was in there. Somebody who talked to me real nice and then... and then touched me somewhere bad. [pushes the door open. Woodsy is molesting the actual boy Mackey]
2455,14,10,Real Mackey,"No Woodsy! Hmkay? Don't touch muh pee pee. No Woodsy, please. I'll give a hoot, hm'kay?"
2456,14,10,Mr. Mackey,Woodsy Owl! No! I'll never litter again! I'll keep all my trash! No please Woodsy no! [the woods begin to rumble and shake]
2457,14,10,Fire Captain,What's happening?
2458,14,10,Expert 2 (Eames),Dream conundrum. This is bad. [Woodsy breaks through the front wall of the shack with glowing red eyes and roars]
2459,14,10,Fire Captain,What the hell's going on?
2460,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,"The bad memory is manifesting itself! It didn't wanna be exposed! [Woodsy runs towards the group. The experts begin shooting at it and advance, but Woodsy remains unharmed] Our dream bullets don't hurt it. [Woodsy reaches for Mr. Yelman and decapitates him with a swipe of his left wing]"
2461,14,10,Mr. Mackey,"No! No more, Woodsy. [hides his face]"
2462,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Mackey, you have to wake up now!"
2463,14,10,Expert 1 (Arthur),"He can't! Don't you get it?! We're all gonna go to limbo! [Woodsy roars again, and Freddy's blades rip through Woody's back and chest]"
2464,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,"There's a real hoot for ya, Woodsy! [pulls his blades out and Woodsy falls down dead]"
2465,14,10,Mr. Mackey,It's dead... It's finally dead. [grins]
2466,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,Something's happening. I'm getting Bogart levels on all counter ups.
2467,14,10,Pinkerton,"They're waking up. They're coming to. [enters the lab, and Dr. Chinstrap follows]"
2468,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Ahhh, you're back, everyone! [grins]"
2469,14,10,Randy Marsh,"Aw, dammit. [Sharon is just happy Stan is back as they grin at each other]"
2470,14,10,Fire Captain,"Thanks, Freddy."
2471,14,10,Freddy Krueger and his wife,If only I could have saved the sheep herder.
2472,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Well, did you find the painful source of your hoarding problems, Mr. Mackey?"
2473,14,10,Mr Mackey,I sure did.
2474,14,10,Leonardo DiCaprio,Turns out he was molested by Woodsy Owl.
2475,14,10,Mr Mackey,"I completely blocked it from my memory, hm'kay?"
2476,14,10,Fire Captain,"So, he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember Woodsy's voice saying ""Give a hoot, don't pollute"" and touching his penis with his wing?"
2477,14,10,Pinkerton,"Wow, that is so complex and trippy and cool!"
2478,14,10,Dr Chinstrap,"Well, now that we've uncovered Mackey's source of hoarding, we can finally move on to yours, Stan. Are you ready for your therapy?"
2479,14,10,Stan Marsh,[thinks a moment] I think I have a better idea.
2480,14,10,Wendy Testaburger,"Stan, did you find out the reason you've been hoarding?"
2481,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Whatever it is, I don't wanna know. I'm just gonna throw this crap away like I should have to begin with."
2482,14,10,Kyle Broflovski,"But dude, there must be something in your past you're not dealing with."
2483,14,10,Stan Marsh,"Don't care. After going through all that crap and seeing what happened to Mackey, I don't want any part of therapy!"
2484,14,10,Kyle Broflovski,How do you know... [this stops Stan cold] that wasn't your therapy? [Dr. Chinstrap walks up and begins his accompaniment...]
2485,14,11,Coon,"My fellow heroes, tonight I stopped three murders from happening. [begins pacing back and forth] I don't know why, but we're seeing a huge trend in crime. We have to find out the source of this evil. Something big is about to happen, and it is up to Coon and Friends to stop it. [Stan raises his hand] Yes, Toolshed."
2486,14,11,Toolshed,"Why do we have to be called ""Coon and Friends""?"
2487,14,11,Coon,[stops] ...What?
2488,14,11,Toolshed,"We all fight crime together. How come we're just your ""friends""?"
2489,14,11,TupperWear,"[steps forward] Yeah. We wanna be called ""The Extreme Avenger League."""
2490,14,11,All,Yeah! That's right. Extreme Avenger League!
2491,14,11,Coon,"I told you, TupperWear, Extreme Avenger League doesn't work."
2492,14,11,TupperWear,Why not?
2493,14,11,Coon,It's confusing! The Coon is a brand people already know.
2494,14,11,Mosquito,Why can't it be Mosquito and Friends?
2495,14,11,Coon,"Nobody's fucking heard of you, Mosquito!"
2496,14,11,Mosquito,"Have, so."
2497,14,11,Coon,"[paces again] Look guys, we need to find out what's causing the crime wave in this city. [stops] Mysterion, you and the Human Kite get on the computer and dig up what you can. TupperWear and Mosquito, scan the news. Toolshed, you run a perimeter check with Iron Maiden."
2498,14,11,Iron Maiden,Timmeh!
2499,14,11,Coon,"Let's work, people! [the other heroes begin to leave, but Coon holds one back] Uh, Mint-Berry Crunch, could I have a quick word with you in the debriefing chamber? [takes Mint-Berry Crunch to a corner of headquarters, sits behind a desk and sighs] Okay, ummm, I really enjoy having you be a part of Coon and Friends and I certainly appreciate your on-time paying of dues and fees; it's just... I don't... I'm not getting your deal. I mean, exactly what is Mint-Berry Crunch supposed to mean? [Mint-Berry Crunch's jaw drops] I, I get that you're half man and half berry, and that you're... crunchy with some mint, but... to be a part of Coon and Friends, you have to have a clear and more... superhero kind of identity. [Mint-Berry Crunch just looks at himself, then back at Coon] Mint-Berry Crunch, ummm, I'm just wondering if... maybe you need to add something else to the Mint-Berry Crunch part of your costume."
2500,14,11,Mint Berry Crunch,[looks at himself again] Like milk?
2501,14,11,Coon,"[annoyed] No, not like milk! You see, I really think we're on different pages here, Mint-Berry Crunch! It's like you don't even- [an alarm sounds]"
2502,14,11,Alarm,Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert.
2503,14,11,Coon,"Uh oh! [quickly leaves his chair. The superheroes meet up again in front of a big monitor, which is receiving video in Coon-O-Vision.] What's the alert, Mosquito?"
2504,14,11,Mosquito,There's like a big fire or something in town.
2505,14,11,Coon,What? A fire? Coon volume up! [grabs the remote and clicks the up arrow for volume]
2506,14,11,News 4 Reporter,"There's thought to be at least twenty people trapped inside the apartment building, and firefighters are having no luck."
2507,14,11,Coon,"My God, this is what we've been waiting for! Coon and Friends, let's head out!"
2508,14,11,Coon s Friends,"Let's do it! Yeah! Let's go! [they begin to head out, but Cartman stops Mint-Berry Crunch again]"
2509,14,11,Coon,"Yeah, uhh, Mint-Berry Crunch, why don't you stay here and mind the place, okay? Kewl. [Mint-Berry Crunch stays behind as the others leave]"
2510,14,11,Coon,"We've got to get downtown fast, Coon Friends! [walks up to Liane, who's sitting on the sofa reading a book, and stops] Mom, you've gotta drive us downtown!"
2511,14,11,Liane Cartman,"Ohh, it's a little late, sweetie. Why don't you boys just keep playing downstairs?"
2512,14,11,Coon,"Mom, you're the Coon's faithful butler! I wanna go downtown now!"
2513,14,11,Liane Cartman,"Well, all right. [puts down her book and blanket] I guess I can get some groceries anyway. [rises and leads the boys out to the car]"
2514,14,11,Coon,"Into the Coon Mobile, everyone! Let's just hope we get there in time! [everyone gets in]"
2515,14,11,Liane Cartman,"All right, are you little munchkins buckled up for safety?"
2516,14,11,Coon,"Mom, don't talk to us like that! We're fucking superheroes!"
2517,14,11,Liane Cartman,"[bangs the center armrest with her right fist] Eric, what have we talked about with that language?! One more time and I'm not taking you anywhere!"
2518,14,11,Coon,"[exasperated] Oh... I'm sorry Mom, can we go please? [Liane starts the car, and under his breath Coon says] Unbelievable! [crosses his arms]"
2519,14,11,Fireman,We tried gettin' in through the back; it was no good!
2520,14,11,Fire Captain and Crew,Those people are gonna die if we don't do something!
2521,14,11,Liane Cartman,"[pulls up] Oh my goodness, it's a fire. [the boys leave the car]"
2522,14,11,Coon,"Come on, Coon Friends!"
2523,14,11,Liane Cartman,"No- Eric, stay in the car, sweetie!"
2524,14,11,Fire Captain and Crew,Can we try a helicopter?
2525,14,11,Fireman,The winds are too high. The chopper would burn in minutes. [Coon and Friends walk up next to the firemen]
2526,14,11,Coon,"All right, what seems to be the problem?"
2527,14,11,Fire Captain and Crew,"Get back, kids. It isn't safe."
2528,14,11,Liane Cartman,"[walks around looking for Cartman] Eric, poopsie?"
2529,14,11,Coon,"Whatever's happening, you need help from the Coon!"
2530,14,11,Mosquito,And friends!
2531,14,11,Fire Captain and Crew,"Keep those children back, Thompson! [Liane finds the boys and walks up to them]"
2532,14,11,Coon,"Please sir, you must let us-"
2533,14,11,Liane Cartman,"Sweetie, let the nice firemen do their job."
2534,14,11,Coon,Shut! Up! Mom! God!
2535,14,11,Officer,Wait. Look! Up in the sky!
2536,14,11,Fireman,"It's him! My God, it's really him!"
2537,14,11,Fire Captain and Crew,He's come to help us. Captain Hindsight! [in the distance a superhero flies towards the town. He's wearing red and yellow tights and a black cope with a blue eye on it - looking behind]
2538,14,11,Stan Marsh (Toolshed),Who's Captain Hindsight?
2539,14,11,Announcer,"Captain Hindsight, the hero of the modern age. [a series of comic book pictures follows] Once known as Jack Brolin, a reporter for the national news, the hero was born when a freak accident gave him the amazing power of extraordinary hindsight. From toxic spills to unjust wars there is no task too large for... Captain Hindsight! [the hero descends and lands next to the firemen]"
2540,14,11,Fire Captain and Crew,"Captain Hindsight, thank God you've come!"
2541,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,What's the skinny?
2542,14,11,Fireman,"There's people trapped in that burning building, Captain Hindsight. And the fire is so massive we can't get to them."
2543,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"Hmmm... You see those windows on the right side? They should have built fire escapes on those windows for the higher floors, then people could have gotten down. And then on the roof: they should have built it with a more reinforce structure, so a helicopter could have landed on it."
2544,14,11,Fireman,"Yes, of course."
2545,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,And then you see that building to the left?
2546,14,11,Fire Captain and Crew,Yes.
2547,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"They shouldn't have built that there. Because now you can't park any fire trucks where you really need to. [stands up tall] Well, looks like my job here is done. Goodbye everyone! [takes off]"
2548,14,11,Fireman,"Thank you, Captain Hindsight!"
2549,14,11,Officer,Thank youuu!
2550,14,11,Fire Captain and Crew,"All right everyone, I guess that's it. Let's pack it up. [the firemen and officers quickly pack up and leave, but the building keeps burning. Coon and Friends can only watch helplessly as trapped residents scream.]"
2551,14,11,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, boy, did you hear about that fire downtown, Sharon?"
2552,14,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my gosh, yes! They said like 14 people died."
2553,14,11,Randy Marsh,It's just ridiculous to me that they didn't build fire escapes on those upper floors! Ridiculous!
2554,14,11,Sharon Marsh,"Oh I know, and if you ask me, they should've built a roof with enough support to land a helicopter."
2555,14,11,Randy Marsh,"I mean, hello!"
2556,14,11,Stan Marsh (Toolshed),Hey you guys are just repeating what that hindsight guy said.
2557,14,11,Randy Marsh,"Why yes, Stan. Captain Hindsight is our protector and guardian. We're just thankful he was there for that fire. And now we can all eat in peace. [an alarm sounds]"
2558,14,11,Alarm,"Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. [they look around for the source of the alarm, then get up and enter the living room]"
2559,14,11,Randy Marsh,What the hell is that? [they stop in front of the alarm] Who put that there?
2560,14,11,Alarm Alert,"Seriously. All Coon Friends to base. Alert, you guys. I'm seriously."
2561,14,11,Stan Marsh (Toolshed),"[backs up towards the stairs] Mom, Dad? I I finished dinner. Can I go up to my room?"
2562,14,11,Sharon Marsh,"[distracted] Well sure, Stan. [Stan goes upstairs] Wha- How did that thing get there, Randy?"
2563,14,11,Randy Marsh,I don't know.
2564,14,11,Sharon Marsh,Well take it down. It's noisy.
2565,14,11,Randy Marsh,I can't. I don't know what happened to all my tools. [the alarm stays on as they look at each other in wonder.]
2566,14,11,Coon,"Alright, Toolshed is here. We can start."
2567,14,11,Toolshed,"Dude, who said you could put a big siren in my parents' house?"
2568,14,11,Mosquito,"Yeah, I almost got in trouble for it."
2569,14,11,Coon,The Coon must be able to signal his friends when a huge catastrophe breaks out.
2570,14,11,TupperWear,So what's the huge catastrophe?
2571,14,11,Coon,What's the huge-? Did you guys not see that Captain Hindsight guy?!
2572,14,11,The Human Kite,"Yeah, so?"
2573,14,11,Coon,So there's a big superhero out there doing stuff on his own and he's NOT part of Coon and Friends!
2574,14,11,Toolshed,Oh Jesus...
2575,14,11,Coon,"[walks up to a hidden computer, which is actually a prop] I've looked into it and this Captain Hindsight is everywhere. He's like some freelance butthole scab. We need to make him join us!"
2576,14,11,Professor Chaos,"Hey fellas? [the boys turn to see him] Fellas, could you let me out please? It uh it's been like six days. [he's in the Coon's holding cell, with a light outside by which he could see.]"
2577,14,11,Coon,"You aren't going anywhere, Chaos!"
2578,14,11,Professor Chaos,"Yeah, but uh, but uh youuu, but you only gave me this bucket to poop in and it's full now. [pulls the bucket into view] And I ain't got nothin' to eat."
2579,14,11,Coon,"You've got poop, don'tcha? [goes back to the other boys] Now the question is, how are we gonna get Captain Hindsight to join Coon and Friends?"
2580,14,11,Mysterion,Who cares if a hero doesn't want to be part of Coon and Friends?
2581,14,11,Coon,I CARE!
2582,14,11,Mysterion,"Look, all we need to do is wait for the next disaster, then try to beat Hindsight to the scene."
2583,14,11,Coon,There's not gonna be any worse disaster. What could possibly be worse than a fire that kills fourteen people?!
2584,14,11,BP Man 1,"All right, this looks like a jolly good place."
2585,14,11,BP Man 2,"Yes. Let's let her rip. [a crane operator pulls some levers, releasing a cable which enable a giant drill to descend into the water. The drill hits the sea bottom and all the marine animals there scatter.]"
2586,14,11,BP Man 3,"That's it, lads. Collect that oil! [the drill hits some rock and shakes from the impact]"
2587,14,11,BP Man 4,Uh oh! [oil begins to ooze out of the hole into the ocean. It quickly reaches the surface and lots of dead fish pop up immediately] Oh deah.
2588,14,11,BP Man 3,"Oh, don't tell me we did it again?"
2589,14,11,Alarm,Coon and Friends alert. Coon and Friends alert. [they exit the room and see the alarm in the hallway] All Coon Friends report to base. I'm so seriously. Emergency. Coon and Friends alert. [Kenny appears and is ready to go. He turns away and is carrying a small back pack over his right shoulder. He goes to a far window and climbs out]
2590,14,11,Coon,"Good, you're all here. Take a look at this. Coon volume up! [raises the volume. On screen is the BP oil spill]"
2591,14,11,Reporter,"It's a scene of utter despair and catastrophe. Oil from the ocean is spill out out of control, and the rescue effort seems futile."
2592,14,11,Man,It's horrible. We can't stop the oil from contaminatin' everything.
2593,14,11,Woman,Our home is covered in sludge. Where are we supposed to go?
2594,14,11,Cajun Shrimper,"Git a lookie on mah scrimp heuh! Might as give ya the best scrimp this side of Louisiana and now down tuh where we all got up in our scrimp, and it ain't worth a slimy noob it ain't sold on. There, now lookit all the url on mah scrimp!"
2595,14,11,Mysterion,My God! Another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the Gulf!
2596,14,11,The Human Kite,We've got to help those people!
2597,14,11,Coon,Yes. This is definitely a job for Coon and Friends.
2598,14,11,Mint Berry Crunch,Let's pack the Gulf full of flavor! [Cartman looks at him in disbelief]
2599,14,11,Rescuer 1,[a woman] Wait a minute. Look! It's Captain Hindsight! [Captain Hindsight flies towards the rescuers and they begin cheering]
2600,14,11,Coon,Oh no!
2601,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,What seems to be the problem?
2602,14,11,Rescuer 2,"It's that BP Oil rig, Captain Hindsight. It drilled into a marine sanctuary and the environment is being poisoned."
2603,14,11,Rescuer 3,"If we can't stop it, the spill could reach New Orleans."
2604,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,[thinks] Hmm... All right. You see where that rig is drilling?
2605,14,11,Rescuer 3,Yes.
2606,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"It's in too deep of water. They shouldn't have drilled in that deep of water, because now they can't get machines deep enough to fix the spill!"
2607,14,11,Rescuer 2,Aha!
2608,14,11,Rescuer 4,"Yesss, YESSS."
2609,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"Now, if it's a valve that ruptured, then what they should have done is installed the backup valve in case that valve broke."
2610,14,11,Rescuer 2,"I believe they did install a backup safety valve, Captain Hindsight."
2611,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,[thinks] Hmmm... Right. Then they should have had a backup safety valve to that backup safety valve!
2612,14,11,Rescuer 5,"My God, he's right!"
2613,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,My work here is done! I'm off to fine others in need!
2614,14,11,Rescuer 4,"God bless you, Captain Hindsight! God bless you!!"
2615,14,11,Coon,Goddammit! We have got to get that guy into Coon and Friends!
2616,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,[answering the door] Can I help you?
2617,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),I understand this is where Captain Hindsight lives?
2618,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,Yes?
2619,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),"I need to speak with him, please."
2620,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,The captain is very busy dealing with the Gulf oil crisis.
2621,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),"I believe I have something that can help him deal with that oil crisis, sir."
2622,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"Mr. Hindsight, sir. [Hindsight sits behind his desk looking at three monitors with 12 screens each. He turns around at the mention of his name] This young man would like a word."
2623,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"Please, sit down. What can I do for you?"
2624,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),"Mr. Hindsight, I represent some very high-profile people, [sets his briefcase on the table and opens it] and I've been asked to give you some really exciting news. [takes out an application to join Coon and Friends and hands it to Hindsight] You, have been pre-approved to become the newest member, of Coon and Friends."
2625,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,[takes the application] Of what?
2626,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),"I know the Coon personally, and I can tell you, being a Coon friend is the very highest honor. As you can see in those papers, your first three months of dues have actually been waived. This must be amazingly exciting for you."
2627,14,11,Officer 2,"[from one of the 36 screens] Captain Hindsight? Captain Hindsight, please come in! [Hindsight walks over to see what the matter is]"
2628,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,Go ahead.
2629,14,11,Officer 2,The oil keeps coming out! We've got other rigs now catching fire!
2630,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"Listen! They should have hosed down the other rigs as soon as the spill began, and that wouldn't have happened."
2631,14,11,Officer 2,Right. [salutes] Thank you! [Hindsight salutes back. Another screen comes on to his right]
2632,14,11,Fireman 2,"Captain Hindsight! The dolphins that those volunteers cleaned of oil, they, they're all dying!"
2633,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,Get down to the volunteers and tell them they should have used a non-bleaching cleanser! Commissioner!
2634,14,11,Police Commissioner,Yes?
2635,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"Tell Brett Favre he should have never sent actual pictures of his schlong! [the screen the commissioner was on switches over to Santa Monica Pier as Hindsight shows his fatigue] It's not a blessing, it's a curse."
2636,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),"[waits a few seconds, then] ...So, anyways, if you wanna just start filling out the form, we'll get you enrolled in Coon and Friends right away."
2637,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"Look, I'm sorry kid, but I work alone."
2638,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),"Well, see, the problem with that is there's a superhero union called Coon and Friends. But if you refuse to be a part of that union. you are a scab!"
2639,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,Get this kid out of here! I have to think!
2640,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),"[gathers the form and puts it back in the briefcase] Fine! You'll be hearing from my lawy- the Coon's lawyer, sir! [walks away]"
2641,14,11,Anchor Man,"The BP Oil spill in the Gulf continues to get worse every day. As public anger towards the BP Company grows, their president released this statement:"
2642,14,11,Tony Hayward,"[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play] Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, president and CEO of BP. Our accidental drilling spill again in the Gulf us a tragedy that should have never happened. And to all those affected, I want to say, we are deeply sorry. [switch to camera 2 to his left, and he turns to look at it] We're sorry. [on the tundra dressed in winter gear, stroking a baby arctic seal] We're sorry. [in the kitchen with an apron on, taking a tray of chocolate chip cookies from the oven] We're sorry. [skis towards the camera and stops] Sorry. [back on the oil rig] BP has taken full responsibility for cleaning up this spill in the Gulf, and in doing so, we've changed our name from Beyond Petroleum, to Dependable Petroleum. [a shot of the Earth and Moon in an interesting configuration. The Earth has two drills attached to it, the Moon has large creators that look similar to a face, and clouds look similar to flailing arms] We no longer fuck the earth, we DP it."
2643,14,11,Coon,"Gentlemen, my attempts to recruit Captain Hindsight into Coon and Friends have been unsuccessful, but I believe I've come up with a solution. Coon Vision on! [a projector screen is shown, as is the projector on the table. Pictures begin to appear on screen] All we need to do is get pictures of Captain Hindsight naked with Courtney Love. Then we'll tell him if he doesn't join us, we'll put them on the Internet."
2644,14,11,Toolshed,How do we get pictures of him naked with Courtney Love?
2645,14,11,Coon,"Simple, Toolshed. Coon slide 2? [the next slide clicks into place] We dress Professor Chaos up as Courtney Love, take pictures of him naked with a homeless guy, then photoshop Hindsight's face onto it."
2646,14,11,Professor Chaos,"Me?? Awww, come on, fellas, don't make me be Courtney Love."
2647,14,11,Coon,"Gotta get to work fast, people! Coon and Friends, ho!"
2648,14,11,Mosquito,...You want us to take naked pictures of Butters to use as blackmail? That doesn't sound very superhero-like.
2649,14,11,Coon,"That's because you think small, Mosquito! You have a tiny little mosquito brain, that's why you don't come up with the plan!"
2650,14,11,Mosquito,"Nono, look. what's going on down in the Gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero."
2651,14,11,Mysterion,Agreed.
2652,14,11,Coon,Oh who cares about some oil spill environment crap?!
2653,14,11,Toolshed,"Mosquito has a good plan, Cartman! Hear him out!"
2654,14,11,Coon,You don't know that I'm Cartman because my true identity is secret!
2655,14,11,Mysterion,"We all have a say in this organization, Coon! Let Mosquito talk!"
2656,14,11,Coon,"[grudgingly] All right, Mosquito, how do you wanna help people suffering in the Gulf crisis? [crosses his arms]"
2657,14,11,Mosquito,I think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale.
2658,14,11,Coon,[challenging] A bake sale?
2659,14,11,Mosquito,"I have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom. We could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars. Which would be a good deed, and help people."
2660,14,11,Coon,"We're superheroes, not the fucking Girl Scouts!"
2661,14,11,Mysterion,Those people down there need help! Sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways.
2662,14,11,Iron Maiden,Timmeh!
2663,14,11,Coon,[challenging] You think selling lemon bars is helpful to mankind?
2664,14,11,Mint Berry Crunch,More helpful than taking naked pictures of Butters.
2665,14,11,Coon,"Shut up, Mint-Berry Crunch! You aren't even anything!"
2666,14,11,Mosquito,And that's another thing: no more picking on Mint-Berry Crunch!
2667,14,11,Coon,"Oh, what are you, the boss now?!"
2668,14,11,Mosquito,"No, but we are all equal! From now on, we vote! Who wants to go with my plan? [everybody but Coon raises a hand. The Iron Maiden lifts a sword]"
2669,14,11,Coon,"[crosses his arms again, sarcastic] Sounds awesome. Let's do it."
2670,14,11,Toolshed,To the grocery store!
2671,14,11,Coon,"[thinking] As we walked along the road to the grocery store, my Coon sense started tingling. Something was wrong. Very wrong. I've learned to trust my Coon sense. It has always been my guide. And so I knew I must act. A coon must know when to defend itself. [Coon turns to his right and high-kicks Mospuito on the cheek. Mosquito goes up in the air and bounces on the road. Coon kicks him in the balls and leaps at him, and grins. He spreads his claws out and slashes Mosquito on the left temple. Mint-Berry Crunch moves to intervene while Coon continues to rake Mosquito across the face. Coon notices Mint-Berry Crunch coming to Mosquito's aid and slashes him too.]"
2672,14,11,Coon,"[after a while] Well, now we're back to normal. [smiles] Just like before and all forgotten? Right right?"
2673,14,11,Mint Berry Crunch,[defeated] Right right.
2674,14,11,Mosquito,[defeated] Right.
2675,14,11,Coon,"Keewwwl! So what's next for Coon and Friends? [no one says a word, and Coon takes a sip of his soda]"
2676,14,11,Anchor Man,"Another crisis in the Gulf of Mexico as the oil company DP has once again made a huge error. [a glowing plasma seeps out of a big hole while strange creatures float and walk out of there] This time, the oil company has accidentally ripped a hole into another dimension. [beachgoers run for their lives as a many-mouthed three-legged creature lumbers by. A flying creature drops down on a woman, scoops her up in its tentacles, and rips her in two at the waist. Other winged creatures swoop in and abduct other beachgoers. Different creatures walk by the pier and scoop up visitors there, then drop them into open mouths that look like Venus fly traps] The oil company stated that it knew a portal to another dimension was there, but didn't think drilling into it would prove problematic. [two men are fishing when another creature pops up and eats them] Now hundreds of creatures from another dimension are spilling out into our reality and wreaking havoc. [a giant starfish creature sits on the pier floor when a man gets curious and leans in. It snaps shut, leaving him headless. Everyone else jumps back and a woman screams]"
2677,14,11,Tony Hayward,"[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play] Hello, I'm Tony Hayward, CEO of DP. Tearing a hole into another dimension is a tragedy that should have never happened. And as CEO, I would like to say... We're sorry. [sitting in an armchair by the fireplace stroking a sleeping lap puppy] We're sorry. [sitting in a prairie holding a dandelion] We're sorry. [blows the seeds off the dandelion stem. Next, he's in bed looking up somewhat seductively] Sohr-ry."
2678,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,[appears] Captain Hindsight! Sir! Calls for help are pouring in! You've got to get out to the Gulf!
2679,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,I can't help anyone right now! Something came up.
2680,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"What, sir? You know you can tell me."
2681,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,Do you remember last week when I... got really really drunk?
2682,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,Yes sir.
2683,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"Look at those photos on the desk. [the butler walks up to the desk and looks at the photos. The first one is Butters as Courtney Love posing for the camera and the homeless man standing on a stool behind him naked, with Hindsight's face photoshopped onto him. Next, it's Butters on the stool with the homeless man standing behind him. Next, it's Butters posing for the camera and standing on the homeless man's back]"
2684,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"My God, is that you and... Courtney Love?"
2685,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,'Course it's Courtney Love!
2686,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,But when did you have a-
2687,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"I don't remember! That's just the point! I get drunk, I don't remember things! I shouldn't have drank that much, and I shouldn't have mixed alcohols! Alcohol shouldn't be legal! Oh it's maddening!"
2688,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,"That doesn't matter now, sir! People are getting hurt in the Gulf and they need to know what they could've done!"
2689,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,I should have never kept that bottle of Macallan in the pantry! I should have never gotten around Courtney Love and a camera. I should-
2690,14,11,Captain Hindsight and his Butler,Sir! SIR!
2691,14,11,Reporter,"Creatures from another dimension continue to wreak havoc in the Gulf, and the question everyone is asking is, ""Where is Captain Hindsight?"""
2692,14,11,Rescuer 6,"Where are you, Captain Hindsight?"
2693,14,11,Cajun Shrimper,Where are d'you countih ninety-oh bebbly now is showmesitchcum.
2694,14,11,Reporter,"With Captain Hindsight missing, what superheroes can save the Gulf now?"
2695,14,11,Coon,"My fellow superheroes, I have done it. Hindsight is taken care of. And now the country can finally be made aware of Coon and Friends!"
2696,14,11,Toolshed,There's more important things to discuss right now!
2697,14,11,Coon,"Right, Toolshed. Now, how do we deal with these creatures from another dimension?"
2698,14,11,Mysterion,He means we need to discuss things with you!
2699,14,11,Coon,"Okay, what?"
2700,14,11,Mysterion,"Aw, I don't wanna tell him. TupperWear, you tell him!"
2701,14,11,TupperWear,I don't wanna tell him either.
2702,14,11,The Human Kite,"I'll tell him. Coon, I'm sorry, but we're kicking you out of Coon and Friends."
2703,14,11,Coon,You're kicking me out of Coon and Friends.
2704,14,11,Toolshed,"We all voted, it was unanimous."
2705,14,11,Coon,"You can't kick me out of Coon and Friends, I'm the fucking Coon!"
2706,14,11,The Human Kite,"Look, we just believe that you have your goals and ways of doing things and they conflict with what we want to accomplish."
2707,14,11,Mysterion,But we get the headquarters and all the equipment.
2708,14,11,Coon,You don't keep anything! This is my basement and I'll tell my mom on you guys!
2709,14,11,Mysterion,We've already discussed this with her. Mrs. Cartman? [she walks in and approaches Mysterion]
2710,14,11,Liane Cartman,"Yes, Mysterion?"
2711,14,11,Mysterion,Please escort the Coon out of our secret base.
2712,14,11,Liane Cartman,"[takes Coon away from the table and up the stairs] Eric, I talked to you about beating up your friends, didn't I?"
2713,14,11,Coon,"Mom, what the fuck?! The fuck are you doing?!"
2714,14,11,Liane Cartman,"Eric, you do not beat up your friends! And I told you I've had it with your language! [crosses her arms] Your punishment is that your friends will just play superheroes without you! Go to your room!"
2715,14,11,Coon,[incredulous] You've gotta be fucking kidding me!
2716,14,11,DP Executive 1,"Oh dear, we have certainly pooped our trousers this time!"
2717,14,11,Tony Hayward,"Yes, I'm afraid it's going to take more than another ""I'm sorry"" campaign to please everyone this time."
2718,14,11,DP Executive 2,"Oh, what a right pickle we're in. [a flying creature floats up past the windows carrying a screaming man]"
2719,14,11,DP Executive 3,"There is no way to cut the dimensional portal, I'm afraid. The ocean currents and swells are simply too much to get any machines in."
2720,14,11,Tony Hayward,"Wait a tick! [rises] Currents and swells, that's it! I think I know how to fix this!"
2721,14,11,DP Executive 4,"How, by Jove?"
2722,14,11,Tony Hayward,We drill.
2723,14,11,DP Executives,"Drill of course, yes, yes, of course."
2724,14,11,Tony Hayward,"I believe that if we drill on the moon, changing its gravitational pull on our ocean swells, we could cut the dimensional spill."
2725,14,11,DP Executive 5,I don't quite get it.
2726,14,11,Tony Hayward,"We got into this mess by drilling heuh [the Gulf of Mexico], and heuh [somewhere in Peru]. Now, we need to drill heuh! [draws a drill bit entering the moon]"
2727,14,11,DP Executive 6,That looks extremely promising!
2728,14,11,Tony Hayward,"Our environment should stabilize if it's getting drilled here, here, and here at the same time."
2729,14,11,DP Executive 6,The seismic forces will be massive. Do you think the moon can take it?
2730,14,11,Tony Hayward,"[arms crossed] Oh, she'll take it."
2731,14,11,Anchor Man,The DP Oil Company today drilled into the moon and appears to have caused even greater problems.
2732,14,11,Stan Marsh (Toolshed),"Uh oh, I have a feeling we'd better get into our costumes again, guys."
2733,14,11,Reporter,"Tom, the DP Oil Company has had another drilling accident. [Cthulhu appears looming over the oil rig in the Gulf] This time they appear to have unleashed the dark and mighty Cthulhu. [Cthulhu swats a helicopter down with just a gentle wave of his right arm] The rise of Cthulhu from another dimension brings about three thousand years of darkness, Tom, where we will all be driven to madness and made to service Cthulhu's cult as slaves. The president of DP Oil released this press statement:"
2734,14,11,Tony Hayward,"[a soft acoustic guitar begins to play. First, Hayward is at his ranch looking at some horses. He turns around and faces the camera] As president of DP Oil, I want to say... We're sorry. [in the bathroom shaving] I'm deeply sorry. [naked on a bear rug before a fireplace, his butt cheeks rosy-red] Sorry."
2735,14,11,Reporter,"Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn. Praise the dark Cthulhu, long may he reign."
2736,14,11,Stan Marsh (Toolshed),"It's up to us, guys. Let's get to the Gulf! [the seven suit up and leave the house. Mysterion goes to the camera and covers it with his cape]"
2737,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),[voice over] Darkness has taken over our town. The Coon and Friends have given in to evil. It's up to the Coon to stop them.
2738,14,11,Eric Cartman (The Coon),Asshoooles! [leaps out of window]
2739,14,12,Mysterion,"I am Mysterion. Though only nine years old, I dedicate my life to helping people - when I'm not in school. [the book opens to a random page. On that page he is defeating Professor Chaos] For months now I've been protecting my town from crime. But now, something has happened that even I cannot fight alone. [a picture of the oil rig, updating every few seconds to show the spread of the oil slick] The BP Oil Company has drilled and caused a spill in the Gulf like no other. The President of BP apologized."
2740,14,12,Tony Hayward,[on the rig] We're sorry.
2741,14,12,Mysterion,"But they drilled again, and tore open a portal into another dimension."
2742,14,12,Tony Hayward,"[in the field, reclining for the camera] We're sorry. [some pages flip over and various creatures are shown]"
2743,14,12,Mysterion,"Creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the Gulf. BP tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon, but instead they caused the dark lord Cthulhu to emerge."
2744,14,12,Tony Hayward,"[on the bear rug by the fireplace, naked, on his belly] Sorry. [next page has the Coon and Friends as they burst forth from headquarters. Mosquito and Human Kite are shown flying.]"
2745,14,12,Mysterion,"I have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the Gulf. But even the other heroes do not know that unlike them, I do have a power. A power they will now begin to understand. And all will know who and what I truly am! [a swarm of ?'s flies around the screen, and the name of the episode appears]"
2746,14,12,Woman 1,Just terrific what you boys are doing.
2747,14,12,Mysterion,"Thank you, ma'am."
2748,14,12,Man 1,"[holding some bars] I'll take twenty lemon bars, you little rascals."
2749,14,12,Field Reporter,"A terrific human interest story here, Tom. As America wonders what happened to Captain Hindsight, some Colorado kids are being a little ""superhuman"" themselves. They call themselves ""Coon and Friends,"" and they've been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the Gulf crisis."
2750,14,12,Mysterion,We believe that every little bit helps.
2751,14,12,Field Reporter,"Their little ""super club"" consists of seven young heroes. [the boys each strike a pose as they announce themselves]"
2752,14,12,Toolshed,Toolshed!
2753,14,12,Human Kite,The Human Kite!
2754,14,12,Mysterion,Mysterion!
2755,14,12,TupperWear,TupperWear!
2756,14,12,Mosquito,Mosquito!
2757,14,12,Iron Maiden,Timmah!
2758,14,12,Mint Berry Crunch,Mint Berry Crrrunch! [twirls around]
2759,14,12,Field Reporter,"The boys stated that there used to also be a hero named The Coon actually in the group, but they let him go because he was being quote, [reads from his cue card] ""a dick""."
2760,14,12,Toolshed,"Mysterion, if Cartman's gone, why are we still calling ourselves Coon and Friends?"
2761,14,12,Mysterion,"Because it pisses Cartman off beyond belief, and I find that [chuckles] extremely funny."
2762,14,12,Clerk,"Passengers waiting for flight 73 to New Orleans, we thank you for your patience, but the conditions in the Gulf are still delaying our departure. Unfortunately, we've just been informed that the dark lord Cthulhu has shat on the runway at the New Orleans airport, and we'll be delayed at least another hour."
2763,14,12,Passengers,Awwww!
2764,14,12,Coon,"Come on, people! Some of us need to get to New Orleans NOW! [the other passengers look at him] Yes yes, I am the Coon."
2765,14,12,Blonde Girl,The Coon? I've heard of that.
2766,14,12,Coon,Ya have?
2767,14,12,Blonde Girl,I saw on TV. That superhero group that's helping with the Gulf spill. Coon and Friends.
2768,14,12,Coon,"Actually, I'm no longer with Coon and Friends. I work on my own now."
2769,14,12,Blonde Girl,Can I ask you a question?
2770,14,12,Coon,"Yes, of course."
2771,14,12,Blonde Girl,"Do you know Mint-Berry Crunch? What's he like? [Coon glares at her and then punches her out of her seat. He then pounces on her and begins to beat her up. A man comes to pull Coon off the girl, and she gets to punch him back. In comic book form, the man says ""That's it, Coon!"" while others cheer, ""GO COON!""]"
2772,14,12,Coon,"[explains what's happening in the panels. He imagines her as bigger than him] The evil girl villain fought with all her might, but the Coon was too much for her. As people looked on and cheered for the Coon, he clawed and punched the villain's stupid fat face! [""TAKE THAT YOU EVIL BITCH""] This fight would not be the last the Coon fought. Next stop: New Orleans!"
2773,14,12,Mosquito,"That's almost it, superheroes. We're about out of lemon bars."
2774,14,12,Toolshed,"Well then, perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more!"
2775,14,12,Iron Maiden,Timmah! [a man with a creepy fixed grin approaches them]
2776,14,12,Man 2 / Cult Leader,I'll take ten lemon bars.
2777,14,12,Mosquito,Ten. Yes sir! [takes the man's cash and gives him the remaining bars]
2778,14,12,Human Kite,That's definitely the last of them.
2779,14,12,Man 2 / Cult Leader,"You'll never stop him, you know. [Mosquito and Mint-Berry Crunch look at each other in foreboding music]"
2780,14,12,Mosquito,Stop who?
2781,14,12,Man 2 / Cult Leader,"The Great One. [his head sways back and forth as he speaks] Cthulhu. He has risen, and soon all will be under his rule. It has all been foretold in the Necronomicon. [takes his bars, turns around and walks away. He looks back briefly] Hail Cthulhu! The darkness of the mythos is finally here. [samples one of the bars] Oh man, these are really good lemon bars. [turns around and goes to his car]"
2782,14,12,Toolshed,The Necronomicon?
2783,14,12,TupperWear,What's a mythos?
2784,14,12,Mysterion,"I don't know, but I think we'd better find out."
2785,14,12,Toolshed,"All right, superheroes. Back to our secret base!"
2786,14,12,Mint Berry Crunch,Mint-Berry Crrunch!
2787,14,12,TupperWear,What the hell?!
2788,14,12,Mosquito,I knew it! Cartman tore our base up!
2789,14,12,Mysterion,Not Cartman.
2790,14,12,Human Kite,"What do you mean ""Not Cartman,"" dude?"
2791,14,12,Mysterion,Whoever did this to our base was looking for something.
2792,14,12,Captain Hindsight,"[silhouette, holding a gun] Don't anybody move! [comes into the light, drunk] So you're the superheroes trying to blackmail me!"
2793,14,12,Toolshed,"Aw, dude, it's Captain Hindsight."
2794,14,12,Narrator,"Captain Hindsight, [the captain takes a sip of Macallan] the hero of the modern age. Once a reporter for the National News, Jack Brolin always had a knack for hindsight. [""Perhaps they should have called the police sooner""] Wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country, Jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels. But then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment. The reporter's hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels! [""It's too much!"" He holds his head together. ""I shouldn't have done that!""] For months he was able to use his new powers for good, fighting for peace, and the American way. [a panel shows him helping firefighters] With his three trusty companions, Shoulda, Coulda, and Woulda. [three creatures with only hind legs and lower lips thrust out] But now, the Hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume Jack's very soul. It's Captaiiin Hindsight!"
2795,14,12,Captain Hindsight,I shoulda never mixed vodka and Jack Daniels. I shoulda just gone to bed last night!
2796,14,12,Toolshed,"Um dude, are you okay?"
2797,14,12,Captain Hindsight,[cocks and aims his pistol at the boys] Where are the pictures?! Give every copy of the pictures to me NOW!
2798,14,12,Mint Berry Crunch,"P-p-please sir, w-we don't know what you mean."
2799,14,12,Captain Hindsight,[whips out the pictures mailed to him] You got pictures of me having sex with Courtney Love!
2800,14,12,Professor Chaos,Uhhh ohhh...
2801,14,12,Mysterion,Chaos! Why did you take those pictures?!
2802,14,12,Professor Chaos,"But uh, but, but the Coon said if I took the pictures he, he'd let me go home and, and I've missed four days of school now 'cause I've been-"
2803,14,12,Captain Hindsight,Alright enough! What's going on?!
2804,14,12,Mysterion,"Hindsight, that isn't Courtney Love! Our former member, the Coon, tricked you!"
2805,14,12,Captain Hindsight,It's not Courtney Love?
2806,14,12,Mysterion,"Please sir, put down the gun."
2807,14,12,Captain Hindsight,No! What if I put down the gun and realize I shouldn't have?!
2808,14,12,Toolshed,"Look dude, we don't need to play Superhero anymore. We can just go home."
2809,14,12,Captain Hindsight,NO! Because I could realize I shoulda killed you all!
2810,14,12,Mysterion,"Then do it! [walks right up to the pistol and places himself at the end of the barrel] Pull the trigger, Hindsight! If you don't believe us then you don't have a choice! Pull the trigger, you pussy!"
2811,14,12,Human Kite,"Dude, Kenny, ch-chill out."
2812,14,12,Mysterion,You guys go! I'll deal with this prick!
2813,14,12,Mint Berry Crunch,"[the first up the stairs] Wuh uh okay, if you insist. Uh see ya, Kenny."
2814,14,12,Human Kite,"My mom did tell me I had to be home by five, I-"
2815,14,12,Mysterion,I said it's fine! Just go! [the other boys leave]
2816,14,12,Toolshed,"[stops] Uh, text me later, Kenny, if you wanna, like, play basketball or somethin'. [leaves]"
2817,14,12,Coon,"Cthulhu! Cthulhu, dude! Over here! [Cthulhu turns around and looks at Coon] Hey Cthulhu. 'Sup? Yes, it is me, the Coon! But don't worry, I'm actually not here to fight you! We are not so different, Cthulhu. Though I am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension, perhaps, we can work together! [Cthulhu looks around] I know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves. I do, bro! But there's a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop YOU! [Cthulhu leans towards Coon at eye-level] Good, I have your attention. The superhumans I speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you! They reside in Colorado and they are fucking assholes, and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion! You can do that, right? Send people into a dark oblivion? 'Cause that's what those buttholes deserve! [Cthulhu withdraws and walks away] No-Dude! Dude, Colorado is that way! Where are you going?? [runs back down the track] Goddammit, why don't dark lords fuckin' listen?!"
2818,14,12,Captain Hindsight,"It doesn't matter. [takes a swig of Macallan] Even if the pictures are fake. I can't take it anymore. [turns away] Do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight? [takes another swig] As soon as something bad happens, I immediately know how it could have been avoided. I can't take it anymore!"
2819,14,12,Mysterion,"People need you, Hindsight! [Hindsight takes a swig of Macallan] Without you they feel helpless and stupid."
2820,14,12,Captain Hindsight,"Well I don't want the power anymore, alright?!"
2821,14,12,Mysterion,"You think your power's a curse?! Let me tell you something about curses, buttlicker! [turns around. Hindsight, curious, turns to face him] Because there's some superpowers that make yours look like nothing! Trust me, I know."
2822,14,12,Captain Hindsight,Wha-? What is your power?
2823,14,12,Mysterion,"[turns around] I can't die. [pauses] I've experienced death, countless times. Sometimes I see a bright light. Sometimes I see heaven. Or hell. But eventually, no matter what, I wake up in my bed, wearing my same old clothes. [turns away] And the worst part? Nobody even remembers me dying. I go to school the next day, and everyone is just like, ""Oh hey Kenny."" Even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes. [faces Hindsight] You wanna whine about curses, Hindsight? You're talking to the wrong fucking cowboy."
2824,14,12,Announcer,"And now, a special announcement from the president of BP and DP."
2825,14,12,Tony Hayward,"Hello, I'm Tony Hayward. The tragic spill in the Gulf is a disaster that should have never happened. And as head of the oil company responsible, I would like to say, what should I do? [looks at the camera to his left] Should I admit we've made mistakes? [the spill is shown again] Should I remind you we've done this before? What should I do? Should I find newer and better ways to say I'm sorry? [Jumps out of a giant three-tiered BP cake with stars on his nipples: ""We're sorry.""]"
2826,14,12,Captain Hindsight,"[at a podium] Should I really believe I ruined my legacy? [behind him is a large banner that reads ""Captain Hindsight""] What should I do?"
2827,14,12,Tony Hayward,[voice-over] What should I do?
2828,14,12,Mysterion,[voice-over] What should I do? [shown getting a massage] Should I forget about the past and not care about my powers?
2829,14,12,Tony Hayward,"Or should I tell you, ""I am not a role model."" [winks]"
2830,14,12,Captain Hindsight,"[on the steps in the alley side of a building drinking Macallan] Seriously, what should I do?"
2831,14,12,Tony Hayward,[in Western Outlaw getup] Should I accept my role as the villain?
2832,14,12,Mysterion,[in a familiar alley] Maybe I should just... disappear.
2833,14,12,Tony Hayward,[at the rig inspecting the blueprints] Should I not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldn't happen? They're my technicians! [blinks twice]
2834,14,12,Captain Hindsight,"[on a darkened basketball court] Hindsight's a bitch, isn't it?"
2835,14,12,Coon,[thinking on the roller coaster track] Should I just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back? Tell then that I was being a selfish jerk? [aloud] What should I do?
2836,14,12,Captain Hindsight,[in the chair that gave him his superpower] Should I get back in the chair? Remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter? [activates the chair]
2837,14,12,Coon,"[thinking on the roller coaster track] Should I admit I was wrong? Ask for everyone's forgiveness and go back to my original team? [aloud] Nah, screw that. I'm just gonna keep bein' a fuckin' dick! [jumps off the track]"
2838,14,12,Toolshed,"All right, superheroes, we've got to find out more about this Necronomicon thing!"
2839,14,12,Mosquito,"Right, Toolshed!"
2840,14,12,Human Kite,"Here we go: ""The Necronomicon contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them."""
2841,14,12,Toolshed,"""It is used by cults around the world, most notably the Cult of Cthulhu."""
2842,14,12,Mint Berry Crunch,"Aha! That's the cult the creepy man talked about, heroes. Uh, you okay, Mysterion?"
2843,14,12,Mysterion,"[away from the group, in deep thought] I'm fine."
2844,14,12,Human Kite,"Ten arrested in South Park for cultish activity. This is from like, ten years ago."
2845,14,12,Mysterion,So these people have been waiting for Cthulhu a long time.
2846,14,12,Human Kite,"Hey wait a minute. Dude. Mysterion, it's your parents."
2847,14,12,Mysterion,"Uhh, what? [goes to see. He looks at the screen and his expression changes to one of dismay. His parents are pictured getting arrested along with the creepy man and Mr. Adler, shop teacher, among others. In his normal voice] What the fuck?! I m-I mean, [going into his superhero voice] Uh, I mean, what the fuck?! [takes over as Human Kite leaves the chair]"
2848,14,12,Betsy Donovan,"[knocks on the door] Clyde? Clyde, I told you this morning to take the garbage out. [Betsy knocks some more. Mosquito, Human Kite, and Mint-Berry Crunch look at each other] Clyde, do you hear me?"
2849,14,12,Mosquito,"[pulls his vuvuzela off his face] Okay Mom, just give me two minutes. [puts it back on] Nag nag nag. [buzzes a bit]"
2850,14,12,Coon,"Convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task. After days of killing and conquering, Cthulhu is at rest. Now is my chance to make a move. Perhaps last time I was too forceful with the dark god. Too demanding. To get what it wants, sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious. [a raccoon is shown aiming to grab a sandwich from someone's left hand] But sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute. [the same raccoon is shown sitting on its hind legs begging for the sandwich] Time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe. [as Cthulhu sleeps, Coon gets on its belly and giggles, then pats its belly. Cthulhu makes some sounds, then goes back to sleep] Who's the sleepy little man? [pats its belly again. This time Cthulhu sneezes and blows Coon off. Cthulhu licks his lips and goes back to sleep. Coon, undaunted, climbs right back on its belly. Giggling, he scoots closer. Cthulhu opens its eyes. Cartman smiles broadly] My name is the Little Coon. What is your name? [Cthulhu moans a bit, then open its mouth wide and roars. Coon struggles to stay on this time. When Cthulhu closes its mouth, Coon mimics him] Craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! [Cthulhu opens its eyes wide as Coon giggles. Cthulhu moans] You're a sleepy man ne, Cthulhu? [scratches Cthulhu's belly] Who's a needs a tummy rub? [Cthulhu makes moans happily]"
2851,14,12,Mrs McCormick,"You're hoggin' it all, asshole! [she reaches for it, but he keeps it away]"
2852,14,12,Stuart McCormick,"'Cause I paid for it, you stupid bitch!"
2853,14,12,Mrs McCormick,[she keeps reaching for it] You paid for it with the money I made washing dishes at the Olive Garden!
2854,14,12,Stuart McCormick,[pushes her off] I told you to shut up!
2855,14,12,Mrs McCormick,"[punches him] Give to me, you prick! [they fight over the joint, suddenly realizing Mysterion is at their window watching them] AH! AAAAH! [both of them fall off the bed and then peer up from the side] Oh God he's back! It's that mystery kid again!"
2856,14,12,Stuart McCormick,"Uh what the hell do you want this time? Hey look, w-we did what you told us! W-w-we treat our kids better and we don't beat each other up as much."
2857,14,12,Mrs McCormick,And we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin' high every night. [Stuart realizes he's still holding the joint and chucks it away]
2858,14,12,Mysterion,I'm not here about that.
2859,14,12,Stuart McCormick,"Oh. Uhuh, sss-so now what?"
2860,14,12,Mysterion,Ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult.
2861,14,12,Mrs McCormick,[looks at Stuart] We were?
2862,14,12,Stuart McCormick,"We've been arrested lots of times, Mysterio."
2863,14,12,Mysterion,Mysterion. What is the Cult of Cthulhu?! [the parents look at each other]
2864,14,12,Stuart McCormick,"Oh, that thing. Nooo, we weren't in that stupid group. They just used to offer free beer at their meetings, so we would go."
2865,14,12,Mysterion,What happened at those meetings?
2866,14,12,Stuart McCormick,"Trust us, we don't remember. Uh uh, I know it sounds hard to believe, but we were actually really drunk the entire time."
2867,14,12,Mysterion,I don't find that hard to believe at all.
2868,14,12,Mrs McCormick,"I swear, we haven't been back to their meetings ever since, even though we always still get invited."
2869,14,12,Mysterion,These people still meet? Where?
2870,14,12,Stuart McCormick,Where they always did. Jim McElroy's house.
2871,14,12,Mrs McCormick,"They used to meet every Friday night. I think they still do. [and with that, Mysterion vanishes. The window remains open, but no one is in it. Mrs. McCormick gets back on the bed. Stuart gets the joint back, sits next to her, and lights the joint] Did that really just happen?"
2872,14,12,Stuart McCormick,I don't think so. [takes a drag]
2873,14,12,Field Reporter,"Breaking news here in the Gulf, Tom. The dark ancient god Cthulhu has called for a press conference, The Old One told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news."
2874,14,12,Coon,"Ladies and Gentlemen, today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of Cthulhu, and the Coon. Cthulhu's track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question. And now, coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of The Coon, we intend to bring change and fight injustice. As the all-new Coon and Friends. And anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law! Oh, what's that? There is another group using our trademarked name? Well, I guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion, don't we?!"
2875,14,12,Followers,ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.
2876,14,12,Man 2 / Cult Leader,"The Old One has awakened! [draws back his hood; it's the creepy man, or Man 2, from earlier] A lot of us have waited a long time for this day. Well for all our South Park Cthulhu members old and new, it is time to par-tay! [lukewarm response. Outside, Coon and Friends watch from a low window]"
2877,14,12,Mysterion,There must be clubs like this all over the world.
2878,14,12,Toolshed,"We know some of these people. There's Mr. Adler, from shop class. And those two geeky computer guys."
2879,14,12,Human Kite,"Oh my God, look! Back row. Aren't those the Goth kids?"
2880,14,12,Pete,I'm so freaking stoked that Cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists.
2881,14,12,Michael,Yeah. I just hope he puts an end to the fucking Disney Channel.
2882,14,12,Toolshed,"Dude, why would the Goth kids worship Cthulhu?"
2883,14,12,Mysterion,Makes sense. Unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth.
2884,14,12,Man 2 / Cult Leader,"Now let us read from the Necronomicon. ""That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons"""
2885,14,12,Followers,"""Even Death may die."" [the boys turn away from the window]"
2886,14,12,Toolshed,"""In strange aeons even Death may die?"" What does that mean, Human Kite?"
2887,14,12,Human Kite,"I'm not sure, Toolshed. Could it be a riddle, Mysterion? M-! Mysterion? [Mysterion is gone]"
2888,14,12,Mint Berry Crunch,Mysterion is sooo... mysterious.
2889,14,12,Jack Brolin (Captain Hindsight),"A horrific scene of destruction, despair and terror here in New Orleans. And still there's no sign of Captain Hindsight. Rumor has it he got sick of it all, went back to his chair, and removed all his powers."
2890,14,12,Injured Man,"[in the background, walking by with his left hand over his injured right upper arm] Where are you Captain Hindsight? Aggh!"
2891,14,12,Jack Brolin (Captain Hindsight),Perhaps... he shouldn't have gotten back in that chair...
2892,14,12,Pete,[kicks a can aside] Do you think the dark lord Cthulhu is gonna make us go to school?
2893,14,12,Michael,"No, assmunch. Cthulhu just wants chaos, bedlam, and madness."
2894,14,12,Pete,"Good, because if I have to go to PE class again, I was gonna kill myself. [they notice Mysterion looking at them from the edge of a roof] Who the F'n H is that?"
2895,14,12,Mysterion,"[jumps off the roof and lands on the alley floor, on one knee] What does it mean? ""That is not dead which can eternal lie""?"
2896,14,12,Michael,"[takes a drag of his joint] ""And with strange aeons even Death may die."""
2897,14,12,Mysterion,What does it mean?!
2898,14,12,Pete,"It means Cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff. It's gonna be like, a Nine Inch Nails concert that goes on forever."
2899,14,12,Michael,"Yeah, so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants, poser."
2900,14,12,Mysterion,[rises and walks towards them] You're going to tell me everything you know!
2901,14,12,Firkle,"[pulls out a switch blade and opens it] Nobody's stopping Cthulhu now! All will be sadness. Life will become death, and I will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck."
2902,14,12,Michael,"Dude, that little kid is hardcore goth."
2903,14,12,Pete,Hardcore goth.
2904,14,12,Man 2 / Cult Leader,"[he and Nelson appear behind Mysterion, who turns around] The child is right, you know. Cthulhu sees all, hears all. The dark lord wants us to dispense of this one, kids. Give us a hand."
2905,14,12,Pete,"Whaaat? Dude, I don't wanna kill anybody."
2906,14,12,Michael,"We're dark lord minions now, wuss. What'd you think we'd be doing?"
2907,14,12,Pete,"Ugh, whatevs. [Mysterion is stuck between the two advancing cult members and the Goth kids.]"
2908,14,12,Singer,"Cthulhu Cthulhu, Cthulhu Cthulhu."
2909,14,12,Coon,Yeeheah!
2910,14,12,Singer,"The evil hate-filled Cthulhu, from a dimension far away.Flying through gates of madness and into your heart"

2912,14,12,Singer,Turning dreams into nightmares
2913,14,12,Coon,Lick my balls!
2914,14,12,Singer,Destroying all he sees
2915,14,12,Coon,Now begins a new adventure for... MEEEE!
2916,14,12,Singer,"You and the dark one, Cthulhu
Sharing adventures and smiles,
It's a magical bond two pals can share.
Soon the whole world will be made aware of
You and the death lord, Cthulhu
Makin' the world a better place.
Together you will have so much fun"
2917,14,12,Coon,Sending all my stupid friends to oblivion!
2918,14,12,Singer,"You and the dark one, Cthulhu"
2919,14,12,Coon,"Suck it, bitches!"
2920,14,12,Man 2 / Cult Leader,"Just hold still and it will all be over quickly. [a buzzing sound is heard, and all look to see who it is]"
2921,14,12,Mosquito,"Let him go! [he's on the roof of a building] Coon and Friends, ho! Mosquito!"
2922,14,12,Toolshed,Toolshed!

2926,14,12,Mint Berry Crunch,[behind the cult members] Mint-Berry Crrrunch!
2927,14,12,Toolshed,"Let him go, dude, or else we'll totally tell our parents on you!"
2928,14,12,Man 2 / Cult Leader,Sorry kids. It's a little late for that. [takes the switchblade from the Kindergoth and stabs Mysterion with it. The cult members and the Goth kids disperse as Mysterion coughs and stumbles. Mysterion stops and then falls flat on his back]
2929,14,12,Toolshed,"Oh my God. Oh my God, they- they killed Kenny!"
2930,14,12,Human Kite,"You bastards! [a pool of blood appears under Kenny when someone knocks on a door somewhere. All of a sudden, Kenny is back in his room, in bed, in his same old clothes. More knocking]"
2931,14,12,Toolshed,"Dude, Kenny, what'd you run away for?! We've gotta fight these guys!"
2932,14,12,Mosquito,"Yeah, come on, get your costume on, lazy-ass!"
2933,14,12,Human Kite,[jumps in the air] Let's go. [the boys move on]
2934,14,12,Mint Berry Crunch,Mint-Berry Crunch! [Kenny sighs]
2935,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"Sit back, justice believers, and listen to another edition of America's favorite superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch! [The camera pulls out to reveal the whole page, which is a cover of ""the AMAZING MINTBERRY CRUNCH""] Our story begins in a remote corner of the Gulf of Mexico. [a graphic of the BP oil rig is shown] The BP Oil Company drills into the ocean floor, [a graphic of a fire destroying the rig] but they drill too much, and the BP Oil Company accidentally unleashes Cthulhu, an ancient evil god from another dimension. Halfway across the country, [Coon & Friends in their normal outfit are shown, with Bradley as the leader instead of Stan] a mild-mannered attractive fourth-grader, Bradley Biggle, hears of the disaster on the news while with his friends. [the page flips over and Bradley is shown transforming] But Bradley Biggle is no ordinary fourth-grader! Not long ago, he realized he had superpowers he could call upon by turning in place and saying the magic word, ""Shablagoo!"" And in a flash, Bradley is transformed into the thrilling superhero, Mint-Berry Crunch! Joined by the other Coon Friends, Mint-Berry Crunch went to investigate the Gulf spill crisis! The superheroes came across a cult, in existence for years, that had been waiting for Cthulhu's arrival. They are the key to stopping Cthulhu from taking over the world! Sometimes, when everything seems hopeless, that's when you need to bring it all. [Mint-Berry Crunch stands at the corner of a roof in a heroic pose] That's when you need... to bring the Crr-runch!"
2936,14,13,Toolshed,"[after a few seconds of silence] Dude, I'm sorry, but we still aren't getting it. You're half man and half berry?"
2937,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,Rrright!
2938,14,13,Human Kite,But then what exactly is your superpower?
2939,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,The power of mint and berries yet with a satisfying tasty crunch!
2940,14,13,Toolshed,"...Nah, see, that's the problem dude, that's not really a superpower. Like, I have mental command over all power tools, Human Kite can fly-"
2941,14,13,Human Kite,And shoot lasers out of my eyes.
2942,14,13,Toolshed,"And shoot lasers out of his eyes. And Mysterion can... [pauses and looks over at Mysterion.] Wait, what's your superpower Mysterion?"
2943,14,13,Mysterion,[with his back to the group] I can't die!
2944,14,13,Toolshed,"...Oh yeah, good one. Mysterion can't die, and Iron Maiden is indestructible-"
2945,14,13,Mysterion,"No, Stan, I'm being serious! I really, really can't die!"
2946,14,13,Toolshed,...Woo-hat?
2947,14,13,Mysterion,"[turns to face them] Like last night, in the alley, the cult leader stabbed me and I bled all over the place! And you screamed ""Oh my God,"" and you called him a bastard!"
2948,14,13,Human Kite,"[arms down and out, palms out] When was that?"
2949,14,13,Mysterion,All the time! I die all the time! And you assholes NEVER REMEMBER!
2950,14,13,Toolshed,"...Ah I think we would remember you dying, dude."
2951,14,13,Mysterion,Well you don't! I die over. And over! Only to wake up in my bed like nothing happened!
2952,14,13,Toolshed,"[notices Mint-Berry Crunch] Dude, you're freaking out Mint-Berry Crunch. He's peed his pants. [Mint-Berry Crunch notices that he has indeed peed his pants and covers his groin quickly]"
2953,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,Nono. Mint-Berry Crunch doesn't ever pee his pants!
2954,14,13,Mysterion,[turns away] I knew there'd be no point in telling you guys.
2955,14,13,Human Kite,"[approaches him] Alright. dude, let, let's just say you're not crazy and it's true. What's the big deal? I mean, I think it'd be pretty cool not to be able to die."
2956,14,13,Mysterion,[confronts him] Pretty cool?! Do you know what it feels like to be stabbed?! To be shot?! Decapitated?! Torn apart?! Burned?! Run over?!
2957,14,13,Toolshed,"Kenny Kenny, calm down."
2958,14,13,Mysterion,"It's not pretty cool, Kyle! It fuckin' hurts! And it won't go away, and nobody will believe me! [walks away, then turns around] Remember this time! Try and fuckin' remember! [pulls out a gun and shoots himself in the head]"
2959,14,13,Toolshed,"Oh my God! Holy shit, dude!"
2960,14,13,Human Kite,Dude!
2961,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,Is he? Oh Jesus! [flees up the stairs and out of the basement]
2962,14,13,Toolshed,[draws closer] Kenny? No! No!
2963,14,13,Coon,"Gather around, believers in good, and listen to the newest installment of The Coon. It all began when the BP Oil Company drilled into the ocean floor and ripped open a hole into another dimension. Seeing the disaster on Coon-Vision, the Coon immediately called together his trusty Coon Friends. As the Coon explained how the disaster could be stopped, something terrible happened. Without warning, the Coon friends changed. Their superpowers morphed somehow, turning them into... supervillains. [the friends are depicted with evil grins] The Coon tried to reason with them, tried to bring them back to the side of good, [""Heroes must be good. Go with Christ!""] but it was too late. [Human Kite: ""GET OUT!!!"" Mysterion: ""WE ARE EVIL NOW!""] Their black hearts had been tainted by hate and rage. The Coon was alone, turn by the ultimate dilemma. [Coon is shown sitting on Lincoln's shoulder at the Lincoln Memorial] He had to put a stop to the evil villains, even though they had once been his friends. Sometimes, to fight the ultimate evil, you must make friends with enemies. [Coon is showing looking at Cthulhu] The Coon teamed up with Cthulhu, because even Cthulhu knows what evil assholes Kyle and Stan and those guys are! And that they are manipulative, uncaring, vagina faces! They're all planning to destroy the world. Only one thing can stop them: the Coon. With Cthulhu's help, I can try to banish them to a dark oblivion, for all eternity. [the Friends are shown surrounding a glowing globe of Earth with evil grins on their faces] I will not rest until that happens."
2964,14,13,Coon,"Bab-ay,
I know you're askin' me to stay
Say ""Please please please don't go away.""
You say I'm givin' you the blues.
[enters the house]
Mayb-ay,
you mean every word you say
Can't help but think-"
2965,14,13,Liane Cartman,[confronts him with her arms crossed over her chest] Eric Cartman!
2966,14,13,Coon,Hi Mom.
2967,14,13,Liane Cartman,"Where have you been, young man?!"
2968,14,13,Coon,Just doin' stuff Mom. Are my friends downstairs in the secret base?
2969,14,13,Liane Cartman,"Yes they are, but you were supposed to be grounded in your room! And now you're more grounded, young man!"
2970,14,13,Coon,"[turns around and thinks hard, to himself] The Coon's mother appears to be extremely upset. In order to get past her, I must use the LeBron James technique."
2971,14,13,Liane Cartman,"Eric, are you listening to me?!"
2972,14,13,Coon,[faces Liane] Mom... what should I do?
2973,14,13,Liane Cartman,[disarmed] What?
2974,14,13,Coon,What should I do? Should I admit I made mistakes? Should I say I've done this before? Should I write a song about how I should have stayed in my room? What should I do?
2975,14,13,Liane Cartman,"What do you mean ""what should-"""
2976,14,13,Coon,"Should I say I am not a role model? Should I not listen to my conscience? It's my conscience, Mom! What should I do? Go back to my room and pretend nothing happened? Not jump out the window and fly to New Orleans? What should I do, Ma? Tell me!"
2977,14,13,Liane Cartman,"[overwhelmed] I just, I- I'm gonna go make you kids some lemonade. [runs off to the kitchen]"
2978,14,13,Human Kite,"Alright Coon and Friends, what good deed should we do next?"
2979,14,13,Mosquito,Perhaps we should make more lemon bars to raise money for people in need.
2980,14,13,TupperWear,Okay!
2981,14,13,Mysterion,"You guys have no memory of me shooting myself in the head, do you?"
2982,14,13,Toolshed,Uh-what?
2983,14,13,Mysterion,What we need to do is talk to people in that cult! I wanna know where my powers come from.
2984,14,13,Human Kite,Yeah cool let's talk about where our powers come from.
2985,14,13,Mosquito,I was bitten by a radioactive mosquito! Bzzzzzzt.
2986,14,13,TupperWear,"I was in a car accident, then put back together with Tupperware parts."
2987,14,13,Iron Maiden,Tih-Timmieh!
2988,14,13,Mysterion,Will you guys listen to me?! I actually have a power that I actually want to know about!
2989,14,13,Coon,"[appearing on the basement stairs] Hey guys. [the Friends look at him] So, what's goin' on?"
2990,14,13,Toolshed,"Go away Cartman. We kicked you out of Coon and Friends, remember?"
2991,14,13,Coon,"No, I, I know. That's cool, I understand. Even though I started it and the secret base is in my house. Yes, that's totally understandable."
2992,14,13,Human Kite,"You just wanted to frame and blackmail people, then you beat up Clyde and Bradley for no reason!"
2993,14,13,Coon,"No you're right. For no reason. Clearly something is wrong with me. But you guys, what should I do?"
2994,14,13,Human Kite,"You should fuck off, that's what you should do."
2995,14,13,Coon,"[sees the LeBron James technique isn't working] Hm. Ah, all right, look. You guys were totally right, okay? That's all I wanted to say. That and... there's a double rainbow outside."
2996,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,A what?
2997,14,13,Coon,"Double rainbow, you guys. You don't see 'em often, but there's one outside right now. You've gotta come see! [rushes up the stairs and out of the secret base]"
2998,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,A double rainbow? Shablagoo! [the heroes all leave their seats]
2999,14,13,Human Kite,"Wait, Mint-Berry Crunch ya you might not wanna go- [goes up the stairs with the others]"
3000,14,13,Professor Chaos,"Huhey, can I see the double rainbow, fellas? [softly] Uh, fellas?"
3001,14,13,Coon,Isn't it beautiful you guys?
3002,14,13,Human Kite,"There's no double rainbow, fatass!"
3003,14,13,Coon,"You are correct, Human Kike! Not that supervillains like you guys could ever see a double rainbow!"
3004,14,13,Mosquito,What are you talking about?
3005,14,13,Coon,"Your evil-doing days are over, Mosquito! All of you shall now be dealt the swift hand of justice!"
3006,14,13,Human Kite,"Cartman, you are the bad guy, not us!"
3007,14,13,Coon,"Nuh uh, you guys are the bad guy. [whistles. A gust of wind blows leaves at the boys, and heavy footsteps follow. Cthulhu soon stands before the Friends, who look at him in awe]"
3008,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,Waaaaaaaaaah! [runs off]
3009,14,13,Mysterion,What are you doing with that thing?!
3010,14,13,Coon,He's going to help me get rid of you guys so together we can make the world a better place!
3011,14,13,Human Kite,"Cartman, if you team up with the most evil thing in the universe, then clearly you are the bad guy!"
3012,14,13,Coon,"No, because it's for the greater good, like when Superman teamed up with Lex Luthor!"
3013,14,13,Human Kite,Superman never teamed up with Lex Luthor!
3014,14,13,Coon,"[thinks it over, then crosses his arms] Well, that's why Superman isn't around anymore, isn't it? Cthulhu! Banish them to a dark oblivion, please! [Cthulhu opens his right paw and sweeps it from left to right in the air. The boys scream and become deformed, then disappear] Aww! Dude, that was awesome! You're all like ""Mehhhh"" and they were all like ""Nooo!"""
3015,14,13,Coon,"All right, now, we've taken out most of the synagogues, destroyed San Francisco, sent my friends into a dark oblivion, and so our next order of business will be Burning Man. [Cthulhu roars softly] Burning Man is the biggest hippie festival in the world, and tomorrow, we're gonna wipe them all out. Pretty soon, the whole wold will be transformed thanks to the Coon! [Cthulhu roars softly] Yes yes, the Coon and Friend. Now after Burning Man we'll take down Whole Foods alright? [Cthulhu repositions himself to confront Coon and roars loudly. Coon thinks] The dark lord is agitated and the LeBron James technique might not work. The Coon will have to use an even more manipulative technique. Time to bust out: Cute Kitten. [aloud] Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow. [climbs up onto Cthulhu.] Meow meow meow. [digs his blades into Cthulhu's back and massages him while at the same time making a comfortable place to nap in. Cthulhu's face softens and he giggles, then looks back at Cartman sleeping on his back. Cthulhu blinks several times, then walks forward softly]"
3016,14,13,Toolshed,"Dude, where the fuck are we?"
3017,14,13,Mysterion,"I don't know, but... I feel like... I've... been here before. [huge butterfly-like creatures pop up from behind some plants]"
3018,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"And so, the Coon had returned with the dark lord Cthulhu! Upon seeing Cthulhu in person, Mint-Berry Crunch heroically dashed off, to, to save the day! With Minty coolness he hurried back home! And heroically watched Judge Judy, knowing that his superhero friends were probably just fine without him!"
3019,14,13,Toolshed,Oh shit!
3020,14,13,Human Kite,[panting] We aren't going that way!
3021,14,13,Mosquito,"You guys, I wanna go home."
3022,14,13,Toolshed,"We all wanna go home, Clyde. I don't think we're gonna last very long out here."
3023,14,13,Mosquito,"Look, maybe we should just a place to hid and wait for help."
3024,14,13,Human Kite,"What help, dude? Nobody in the real world even knows we're here."
3025,14,13,Mysterion,"Alright, you guys hide as long as you can. I'll try and find help. [moves away from the cliff]"
3026,14,13,Toolshed,"How, dude?"
3027,14,13,Human Kite,"Kenny, where the hell are you going?"
3028,14,13,Mysterion,"I'm going to try to get you all out of here. If this works. Or, I could be wrong. [runs towards the cliff]"
3029,14,13,Mosquito,Kenny! [Kenny jumps off the cliff and impales himself on some big spiky plants ]
3030,14,13,Mysterion,Ow! That fucking HURTS! [moans a few times and dies.]
3031,14,13,Toolshed,Oh my God! Kenny!
3032,14,13,Human Kite,"You... you crazy bastard! [the boys turn away from the edge, seemingly forgetting their dead friend below]"
3033,14,13,Man 1,[on a fish-cycle] It's burning Man!
3034,14,13,Man 2,"[dressed as an angel] Biggest party in the world, baby! [more shots of the festival are shown. It's a carnival, but a roar changes all that. Cthulhu appears and throws an RV into the festival, and everyone scatters]"
3035,14,13,Coon,"[on Cthulhu's back] Fucking hippies! Fuck all o'you! [Cthulhu raises his left paw and unleashes a lightning bolt upon a girl, incinerating her and leaving nothing but bones]"
3036,14,13,Reporter,"The dark and evil Cthulhu is bringing his angry wrath down upon the Burning Man Festival, Tom. Cthulhu isn't behaving as most scientists had speculated, Tom, but the dark lord is wreaking havoc everywhere and-"
3037,14,13,Coon,"[walks up and interrupts him] No nonono! Excuse me! It is not Cthulhu, it is Coon and Friend! I'm a little sick of everyone giving him all the credit when I'm the one really making the world a better place!"
3038,14,13,Reporter,"Tom, it appears that Bruce Vilanch has arrived on the scene wearing a rat costume."
3039,14,13,Coon,"Oh, you motherfucker! [runs towards Cthulhu] Cthulhu, this guy too! [Cthulhu unleashes more lightning and the reporter is incinerated] Kewl. Oh get that fire-twirling hippie bitch."
3040,14,13,The Goth Kids,"This freaking sucks! We worshiped and prayed to Cthulhu, went to all the cult meetings, but life is still totally freaking gay."
3041,14,13,Pete,I thought that when Cthulhu rose from the dead all was gonna be darkness and pain. I thought at least school would be canceled.
3042,14,13,A Voice,How to I fight him? [the Goth kids look at the window and see Mysterion there]
3043,14,13,Michael,"Oh joy, it's Underwear Boy again."
3044,14,13,Mysterion,That god you pray to just took away all my friends.
3045,14,13,Pete,"Not our god. He promised everything would change if we worshiped him, but we're still sitting here smoking cigarettes like before [hair flip] It's like Obama all over again."
3046,14,13,Mysterion,How do I fight him?!
3047,14,13,Pete,"Cthulhu isn't alive or dead, alright?"
3048,14,13,Mysterion,Tell me what that means! [the bedroom door opens and Henrietta's mom appears]
3049,14,13,Mrs Biggle,"Henrietta, your little brother wants to play with you."
3050,14,13,Henrietta,"Go away Mom, I hate you."
3051,14,13,Mrs Biggle,"Just let your little brother play with your friends, sweetie. He's lonely. Go on in, Bradley. [Bradley appears and enters the room]"
3052,14,13,Bradley Biggle (Mint-Berry Crunch),Will you guys play with me?
3053,14,13,Henrietta,"Fuck off, dork! I don't want you here!"
3054,14,13,Bradley Biggle (Mint-Berry Crunch),"Please, can I just- oh g'uh! [sees Mysterion in the window] Mu-Mysterion! Wuh what's goin'- Uh, that's okay, sis. I'll play with you another time. [leaves and closes the door]"
3055,14,13,Bradley Biggle (Mint-Berry Crunch),Mysterion is here! He must have come for my help. [enter his room] No time to waste. Time for Bradley Biggle to transform. [opens a drawer under his nightstand and sees his costume] Shablagoo! [turns in place]
3056,14,13,Henrietta,"Alright, look. The Necronomicon is an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them. [the first page shows a Prince Abdul Al-Kazred in 700 A.D. The next one has the prince genuflecting before an Old One.]"
3057,14,13,Mysterion,One Ones?
3058,14,13,Michael,Dark deities that existed before man.
3059,14,13,Henrietta,"It was written by a mad prince who knew of the nightmare city of R'Lyeh, which fell from the stars and exists beneath the sea. And, in another dimension."
3060,14,13,Mysterion,That's it! That's the place I just was!
3061,14,13,Michael,You've been to the nightmare city of R'Lyeh?
3062,14,13,Pete,Luckyyy...
3063,14,13,Henrietta,"Cthulhu and other beings are from this city, but for years cultists have tried to bring them into our world."
3064,14,13,Mysterion,And what about Cthulhu's power? Why can't Old Ones die?
3065,14,13,Henrietta,The only thing that can destroy an immortal... is another immortal. [Henrietta's door opens again and Mint-Berry Crunch barges into the room]
3066,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"Ahaaa! Don't worry, Mysterion. Mint-Berry Crunch is here to help you with these black cultists!"
3067,14,13,Henrietta,"Get out of my room, TWERP!"
3068,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"Mint-Berry Crunch isn't afraid of his fat sister! Grab her legs, Mysterion! [Mysterion is gone] M- Mysterion? [the Goth kids turn to look at the window.] Aw crap. [runs out of the room]"
3069,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"Hey Mysterion, wait up! [leaves the door open] Come on, wait uuup! [catches up to him] Us Coon Friends need to stick together remember? Where are you going?"
3070,14,13,Mysterion,Wherever Cthulhu is!
3071,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,What? But he'll kill you.
3072,14,13,Mysterion,"Maybe, but with any luck I might find the reason for my powers."
3073,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,Oh right. Maybe I can find the reason for my powers too.
3074,14,13,Mysterion,You don't understand!
3075,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"[turns away from Mysterion] How was it that mint and berry came together delivering full flavor in an intense crunch? [Mysterion leaves] We must find out answers Mysterion. [turns around, but doesn't immediately see him] Mu-Mysterion, I'm going with you."
3076,14,13,Coon,"After the triumphant victory over the evil hippies of Burning Man, Coon and Friends turned their attention to the next villainous scourge, bravely taking out every Whole Foods left in the country! No more organic crap for America! Thanks to Coon and Friends the country would soon be rid of all evil, but first, they would come up against their most challenging and most evil opponent, Justin Bieber. In order to save the Earth, this little butthole had to be stopped."
3077,14,13,Justin Bieber,"[grabbing his crotch constantly, and singing badly off-key] Babih babih babih oooo! Babih babih babih oooo! Babig baibig woo woo, Bay-wooo [Cthulhu reaches down and grabs him off the stage] Wooooo-ooo-oo! [Cthulhu grumbles]"
3078,14,13,Coon,"Yep, that's him. So long, Justin Bieber, you little douchebag! [Cthulhu crushes Bieber between his forefinger and thumb like a grape]"
3079,14,13,Reporter 2,"The dark god Cthulhu continues his rampage of destruction and terror, and there seems to be no hope for man. I'm joined now by a supposed team member of Cthulhu, the Coon."
3080,14,13,Coon,"It isn't just Cthulhu, Mr. Reporter. He's merely a small piece of Coon and Friends, who will continue to fight for good and justice."
3081,14,13,Reporter 2,Good and justice? J-Justin Bieber and most of his fans have just been massacred.
3082,14,13,Coon,"Yes, Coon and Friends are happy to help. We do not need thanks for our deeds. We do not want gifts, all we want is for people to buy our Coon and Friends T-Shirts for $14.95."
3083,14,13,Mysterion,"Hey, fat boy!"
3084,14,13,Coon,Kenny? What the hell? I sent you to the-
3085,14,13,Mysterion,To the sunken city of R'Lyeh fallen from the stars! [approaches him] You little fucking prick! What is wrong with you?! What kind of sick fuck does that to his friends?!
3086,14,13,Coon,"It's not my fault you guys turned evil, Kenny!"
3087,14,13,Mysterion,"You are the bad guy, fat boy! YOU!"
3088,14,13,Coon,I'm going around making the world a better place!
3089,14,13,Mysterion,For you! You're making it a better place for you!
3090,14,13,Coon,"Right, that's what superheroes do."
3091,14,13,Mysterion,No! This is what superheroes do! [walks up to Cthulhu] You banished me but I'm back! What does that make me?! [that gets Cthulhu's attention] Bring back my friends! Take me!
3092,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"[gets through the police line] Mysterion, no! What are you doing?!"
3093,14,13,Mysterion,"[to Mint-Berry Crunch] Only an immortal can kill another immortal! [to Cthulhu] Here's your prize! Take this curse away from me, you big pussy!"
3094,14,13,Coon,[stands next to Mysterion] Don't listen to him Cthulhu! We have more important stuff to do!
3095,14,13,Mysterion,"Go on! Kill me before I kill you! But bring my friends back, wuss!"
3096,14,13,Coon,"Cthulhu, you are a Coon Friend, and I'm the Coon! You will listen to me! [Cthulhu picks Coon up and scolds him, then cradles him. Coon takes the hint and scrambles onto Cthulhu's back. Coon kneads Cthulhu's back again and Cthulhu is relieved. Coon is asleep on Cthulhu's back and Cthulhu turns and walks away]"
3097,14,13,Mysterion,No! Come back! I have to know what I am! Come back!
3098,14,13,Coon,"Fuck you, Kenny!"
3099,14,13,Mysterion,"Come back, you fat piece of shit! [notices something in the sky. Others notice too. A bright object descends onto the parking lot and dims enough to reveal a giant oval shaped light that serves as a holograph. An image of a man appears inside and begins to talk. Mysterion is puzzled]"
3100,14,13,Alien Man,"Hello my son. If you are seeing this message, then it must be dark times. And you must have many questions. Your true name is Gok'Zarah. The power given to you comes from a planet far away. You are from that planet, Gok'Zarah. It is for that reason you have a power that normal humans do not have. I know you must sometimes see this power as a curse, but you were sent here to stop evil from taking over the Earth and now, that time has apparently come. You must now harness and focus your power, Gok'Zarah. The power of mint and berries yet with a tasty, satisfying crunch."
3101,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"...Uh yes. Yes, please go on."
3102,14,13,Alien Man,"Your home planet, K'oh Kajan, is known throughout the universe for its berry mines. Berries that have the power to fuel nearly anything. Needless to say, when the mint hunters of Kogenrah got word of them, our fate was already sealed, Gok'Zarah. But our two worlds collided and soon, mint and berry were one."
3103,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,Wow!
3104,14,13,Alien Man,"Your mother and I sent you as far away as we could. Use your power, son. Save Earth. Shablagoo! [the orb rises up and away]"
3105,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"I will, father. No more running away for... Mint-Berry Crunch! [jumps up in the air and floats up, then aims at Cthulhu and flies towards him] Hello, Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been ""berry"" nice! [unleashes a torrent of berries at him. Cthulhu shields himself, but doesn't go down.] Not enough, huh? Maybe the intense flavor of mint will freshen things up! [Cthulhu is soon enveloped in a tornado of mint leaves]"
3106,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"I reached the Gulf of Mexico in no time, and with all my strength, I dragged Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came! My trusty hero companions were there, still alive. I returned them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble. Then it's back down to fill up the hole created by the BP Oil Company, returning home only momentarily to flip off my fat sister. [""Fuck you! I have powers you fat bitch!""]"
3107,14,13,Toolshed,"Dude, thanks for getting us out of that dark oblivion, Mint-Berry Crunch."
3108,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"Oh no, we worked as a team! All the Coon and Friends stopped the BP drilling spill crisis."
3109,14,13,Human Kite,And finally the evil Coon is right where he belongs. [the Coon is in his own holding cell with Professor Chaos]
3110,14,13,Coon,"Come on you guys, this is fucking bullcrap! Let me out!"
3111,14,13,Human Kite,You're not going anywhere for a long time!
3112,14,13,Coon,"This is inhumane! There's a big bucket with Butters' poop in here, and there's nothing to eat!"
3113,14,13,Toolshed,"Ya got poop, don't ya?"
3114,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"Well, I'm off. There are still many more questions left unanswered. I need to know what happened to my parents."
3115,14,13,Human Kite,"Well, come back and visit any time, dude."
3116,14,13,Mint Berry Crunch,"I will. Shaaablagoo! [twirls in place and disappears in a streak of light, leaving behind berry cereal]"
3117,14,13,Coon,Fuckin' Mint-Berry fuckin' Crunch.
3118,14,13,Toolshed,"Wow, can you believe it Kenny? Bradley actually had superpowers. Isn't that cool?"
3119,14,13,Mysterion,"Yeah. I'm tired, guys. I think I'm gonna go to bed. [takes a gun out and just shoots himself in the head. The other boys jump back in shock.]"
3120,14,13,Toolshed,Oh my God! Holy shit dude!
3121,14,13,Human Kite,Kenny? No! Nooo!
3122,14,13,Stuart McCormick,What? Whaaat?!
3123,14,13,Mrs McCormick,It's happenin' again! [falls back on the bed and raises her legs in the air.]
3124,14,13,Mrs McCormick,[before closing the door] We should have never gone to that stupid cult meetin'. [Stuart turns off the light and Mrs. McCormick closes the door]
3125,14,14,Reporter,"Passenger said the Carnival cruise line smelled like poop, but that that was an improvement."
3126,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[yawns] All right, it's late. I'm gonna call it a night. [leaves the sofa and heads for their room] You coming?"
3127,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Aw, you know, I can't really sleep. I'm just gonna stay up a bit and have some me time."
3128,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[going up stairs, she stops and turns around] Randy, do not watch that no-no channel."
3129,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Ugh. I'm not staying up to do that Sharon, jeez!"
3130,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Alright, come to bed soon."
3131,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Psseh... huh... [glances at the stairs to see if Sharon is gone, then quickly begins changing channels. He stops at a channel where music is playing] Ohhh... Whoahohoohhh... Man, that is hot... [starts masturbating under the sheet] Oh yeah. Fuck."
3132,14,14,Guy Fieri,"[showing off some ribs] Mmm, just look at that rack of ribs; now those are slow-cooked, and then braised to bring out the smokey flavor."
3133,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Mmm, God damn. Yeah."
3134,14,14,Guy Fieri,"[hods up a rib to the camera] See how that just falls off the bone? [eats some more off it] Mmm, that is MONEY right there!"
3135,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it's fuckin' money."

3142,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Ah! You're just in time! Siddown, siddown! I've made you all breakfast again!"
3143,14,14,Stan Marsh,Aw crap. [they go to the breakfast table while Randy serves up their dishes]
3144,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Now, what I have for you is a nice goat-cheese and hierloom tomato frittata. And we're gonna top that with a little crème fraîche. [scoops some out to spread on Stan's plate, slooowly] Aw yeah... Awwww..."
3145,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[on to him] Randy, you've been watching that channel, haven't you?!"
3146,14,14,Randy Marsh,No!
3147,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Yes, because every time you watch cooking shows you stay up all night trying to copy what they made."
3148,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Well, I'm sorry if there's something wrong with me helping out with the cooking! [grabs his coat and heads for the garage. He opens the door and takes a look back] I'd think you'd be grateful, Sharon! I gotta get to work. I cooked, so you guys clean up. [closes the door and leaves. The others look at him leave, then look at the dishes on the counter. That's a lot of bowls]"

3154,14,14,Terrance and Phillip,"Oh dear! I knew we should have gone to Geico! [Kyle says this part with him] Come on, darling, let's get out of here and go there."
3155,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[quickly arrives, takes off his coat, and takes over. The boys get off the sofa] Daddy time. It's Daddy TV time. [On TV, a chef presents his latest creation]"
3156,14,14,Alton Brown,Now just look at this pork tenderloin. It is brined and ready for action.
3157,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Aw yeah, look at that."
3158,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you know Mom doesn't want you watching food channels."
3159,14,14,Randy Marsh,I worked all day! I can watch what I want!
3160,14,14,Alton Brown,We're gonna take a stick of butter and just smear that all over.
3161,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[almost breaks a sweat] Oh my God that's awesome! Oh... [looks at the boys, then takes the blanket hanging on the back of the sofa and puts it over his groin, keeping himself in check] Oh, oh. [starts masturbating] ...Yeah. Whoa."
3162,14,14,Alton Brown,Now let's get that on the grill.
3163,14,14,Randy Marsh,"See what he's doing there, Stan? He brined that for an hour in the fridge, so now he can sear the shit out of it. Whoaoaoaoaoaoaoo."
3164,14,14,Alton Brown,"Look at the char we're getting. That, that is what we're going for."
3165,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh, isn't that hot, guys? Ohgh, yeah. Don't you wanna just... Don't you wanna just get in there and... [the boys notice the fierceness in his voice] Wwrrmmmm! Mmmh!"
3166,14,14,Announcer,We'll be right back to Good Eats.
3167,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"Hey ladies, are you looking for a better workout?"
3168,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[the fierceness vanishes] Aww, stupid commercials."
3169,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Introducing the Shake Weight. A spring-loaded workout device you pump with your arms. Just grab the piston and go to work. One-handed or double-fisted.
3170,14,14,Randy Marsh,[yawns] Come on!
3171,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You just shake it. Back and forth.
3172,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,It feels really good in my hands.
3173,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"Best of all, Shake Weight tells you when your workout is finished by chiming and releasing a cool-down spray. [the Shake Weight chimes and gives two squirts of the cool-down spray]"
3174,14,14,Randy Marsh,Bohh-riiing.
3175,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Order now and we'll include the optional heart rate monitor. Just put your finger in the tester. [a woman shows how it's done] and Shake Weight takes your pulse. [another woman finishes her exercises and gets two squirts] Get yours today.
3176,14,14,Announcer,Now back to Good Eats.
3177,14,14,Alton Brown,Just look at the glaze we've got going now on that thing.
3178,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[back to masturbating] Oh man, yeah, that is hot! Ooomm."
3179,14,14,Alton Brown,"Alright now, here's the really cool part. What we're gonna do is- [a short beep is heard and the screen goes blue. In white letters, this appears:]"
3180,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Channel blocked? [begins clicking channels] What the? The hell? [goes to the master bedroom and finds Sharon clicking away on another remote control] Sharon, what are you doing?"
3181,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Just using the parental controls to block some channels.
3182,14,14,Randy Marsh,I wasn't watching food channels!
3183,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Then how do you know I blocked them?
3184,14,14,Randy Marsh,"I- know 'cause I don't know that! That's what I'm saying! Gaw! [walks away thwarted and goes to his den. He picks up a cordless phone on the way. He leaves the lights off in there and walks to his desk, dialing a number. He sits down as his call is answered]"
3185,14,14,Hotline Man,"Thanks for calling the Food Network Hotline. Billing is nine-ninety-five for each sixty-second period. To accept, say ""crème fraîche."""
3186,14,14,Randy Marsh,Crème fraîche.
3187,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","Hi there, I'm Amanda. What are you up to?"
3188,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh hi, I just uh... thought I'd give the hotline a try. What are you doing?"
3189,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline",I'm making a pan-roasted chicken.
3190,14,14,Randy Marsh,[piqued] Pan-roasted? Like seared on the stove and put in the oven?
3191,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","Uh huh. I've just taken the chicken out of the pan. It's... so moist. I'm gonna let it rest now, about five minutes."
3192,14,14,Randy Marsh,Yeah?
3193,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","Yeah. Ooo, there's lots of brown bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet."
3194,14,14,Randy Marsh,You gonna deglaze that fuckin' pan?
3195,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline",Oh I'm gonna deglaze it. You wanna help me?
3196,14,14,Randy Marsh,"If I was there I would. I'd take some... red wine... 'bout a quarter-cup, and then... a wooden spoon... and I'd deglaze the fuck out of that pan."
3197,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","I got a wooden spoon right here; it's... pretty hard. [upstairs Sharon picks up the phone to make a call, but she hears the conversation and stops to listen]"
3198,14,14,Randy Marsh,Yeah you'd... put some onion in while you're deglazing?
3199,14,14,"Amanda and Hotline Man, from the Food Network Hotline","I was thinking about shallots, actually."
3200,14,14,Randy Marsh,Aw yeah. Shallots won't overwhelm the chicken's natural flavors. Fuck yeah.
3201,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Randy! Marsh!
3202,14,14,Randy Marsh,WAH! Sharon!
3203,14,14,Hotline Man,"Your time on Food Network Hotline has expired. To add more time say ""crème fraîche."""
3204,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"I don't know what to do, Sheila. It's like he's a different person. Last night I walked in on him in the bathroom. He was sitting on the toilet flambéing a pork chop."
3205,14,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Sharon, I'm so sorry."
3206,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"It just makes me feel unwanted, you know? I mean, am I not attractive anymore? I mean I don't exercise anymore at all."
3207,14,14,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, if it'll make you feel better about yourself, then work out, Sharon."
3208,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Like I have time to go to the gym every day.
3209,14,14,Sheila Broflovski,There are plenty of things you can buy to get a good workout at home. Have you heard of the Shake Weight?
3210,14,14,"Michael, BB&B Associate",Help you find anything? [the name tag says Michael]
3211,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, yes. I was interested in the Shake Weights?"
3212,14,14,Michael,Biggest seller the past four months. What models are you lookin' at?
3213,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Oh I didn't realize there were different models.
3214,14,14,Michael,"Well you got your standard, your deluxe model, large sizes, but, if you're really lookin' for a workout you might wanna try the Big Gym. That woman over there is trying it out. [the woman is having some difficulty with the large Shake Weight]"
3215,14,14,Sharon Marsh,I... think I'll start with the smaller white ones.
3216,14,14,Michael,"Small white ones, yes ma'am. [picks up two different models] Standard or voice assist model?"
3217,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Well I don't know-
3218,14,14,Michael,I would definitely recommend the voice assist. It has recorded voice commands to help motivate you in your workout.
3219,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are doing excellent. Great work. Now switch arms. [Sharon switches arms] Wow. Good job. [Sharon begins to gasp for air] You are amazing. You are very attractive and interesting.
3220,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Thank you, Shake Weight."
3221,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"Come on now. Almost finished. [Sharon begins to shake the weight faster] Yes. Good. Almost done. [Sharon shakes the weight even faster and begins to grunt] Keep going. Keep going. Harder. Faster. [Sharon's giving it all she's got, and a bell sounds. She gets two squirts]"
3222,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Hahhh.
3223,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Your workout is finished. [a different bell sounds and Sharon twists the Shake Weight around to get some change] Here is some cab fare.
3224,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Oh wow.
3225,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]
3226,14,14,Stan Marsh,"You guys have no idea how much it sucks! My dad's obsessed! Every day it's Bobby Flay this, Gordon Ramsey that. This morning he was pretending to read Playboy, but he actually had a Bon Appetit magazine hidden inside it!"
3227,14,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, hearing you bitch about your dad all the time is super-interesting, Stan. I hope you do it during the entire lunch period. [the line moves forward and the boys enter to see... Randy as the school chef]"
3228,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Hello there, children!"
3229,14,14,Stan Marsh,Awww what?!
3230,14,14,Randy Marsh,How's it goin'? [behind him is restaurant-quality cooking equipment]
3231,14,14,Stan Marsh,"No, dad! No!"
3232,14,14,Randy Marsh,The school was hiring and I got the job. Isn't that great?
3233,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, you're a geologist! What about your real job?!"
3234,14,14,Randy Marsh,"I quit. Now, what I have for your starters today is a potato-encrusted scallop with lobster foam. Now we're gonna top that with some crème fraîche."
3235,14,14,Eric Cartman,Lobster foam? [Stan shuts his eyes and buries his nose in his right hand] It says very clearly on the lunch schedule that today is pizza day!
3236,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Yes, and so this is my take on a pizza. It's an Asian slaw on flat bread, deconstructed and topped with a nice Parmesan aioli."
3237,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, no! I'm gonna tell Mom. Go back to your other job right now!"
3238,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Stan, there's nothing wrong with a man following his passion! [starts spreading the aioli over the pizza] Ooo yeah, fuck yeah."
3239,14,14,Stan Marsh,Mom? Mom! You've gotta do something! Dad's trying to be our new school chef.
3240,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Oh I know! He tried out all his recipes here and left me with the mess!
3241,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Well you've gotta tell him to stop, Mom!"
3242,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"You think your father's gonna listen to me?! [something begins to beep nearby and Sharon looks at it, then goes to the breakfast table. On it is the beeping Shake Weight]"
3243,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,This is a workout reminder. Time for a workout.
3244,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Oh. [picks up the weight and begins to shake it] This thing is so great. It reminds me when I haven't worked out in a while.
3245,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"That's it. Work it. Harder, faster."
3246,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Mom, Dad's food sucks and kids at school are starting to get pissed at me!"
3247,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[sighs] Sorry Stan, but I need to start doing things for myself! [Stan just looks at her now]"
3248,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are independent and strong.
3249,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Right! I spend all my trying to take care of everybody else!
3250,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Switch arms.
3251,14,14,Sharon Marsh,[switch] I don't need to look good to keep your father interested in me! I'm just going to do it FOR ME!
3252,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are so motivated and charming. It is time to take your pulse. Insert finger. [Sharon puts her left index finger into the device.] Do not stop your arms. Keep going. Good. Get your finger up there a little more. Your pulse is one hundred forty-five. [Sharon shakes the weight harder] Faster. Harder.
3253,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Who says that school cafeteria food can't be healthy, delicious, and gourmet? Today we're gonna be making the students my tasty baked ziti with basil and fresh [in an Italian accent] mozzarella. It's all right here right now on Cafeteria Fraîche."
3254,14,14,Randy Singing,La lalala la la...
3255,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[glazing some marbled beef] Aww, fuck yeah. [next he chops onions]"
3256,14,14,Randy Singing,"Lalalalala la, fraîche, fraîche."
3257,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[sniffing the aroma of freshly cooked turkey surrounded by russet potatoes] Ogh, yeah. Man, that ogh... [takes a small torch to some quiches, shows off a new dish on a fancy plate on a regular tray, squirts out some dinner roll batter on a cooking sheet, grinds some pepper onto a baked ham, flambés some shrimp, checks out some pork chops he's got cooking in the oven and likes what he sees]"
3258,14,14,Randy Singing,"Crème fraîche, Cafeteria Fraîche. Lalalalala fraîche. Ho ho hohoho."
3259,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad, what are you doing?"
3260,14,14,Randy Singing,[as his head floats across the screen] Fraîche. [a logo finally shows up]
3261,14,14,Randy Marsh,Fraîche.
3262,14,14,Randy Singing,Cafeteria Fraîche.
3263,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Alright now, for my baked ziti we are gonna start off by getting some extra-virgin olive oil into the pan. [does so] Oh yeah, get that all over there. It's all slick. ...It's all wet and slick. Oh..."
3264,14,14,Craig Tucker,"Can we have some food, please? [behind him stand Craig, Kevin, and some more fourth graders]"
3265,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Now olive oil does have a low smoke point, so keep that heat low, and keep it fraîche. [the crew is shown: Stan operates the camera, Kyle the boom mike, Cartman and Kenny the klieg lights. Randy grates the cheese over the ziti] Ohhh, ohh that's so fuckin' hot. Look at that crust, it's perfect. Fuck yeah."
3266,14,14,Stan Marsh,Dad! You aren't ever going to be a celebrity chef!
3267,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Quiet on set, please."
3268,14,14,Stan Marsh,"No Dad, that's enough! You need to be focusing on getting Mom back!"
3269,14,14,Randy Marsh,[distracted] Back from where?
3270,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, this is so nice. I really needed this."
3271,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are so lovely and elegant. You can do anything you set your mind to.
3272,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, thanks Shake Weight."
3273,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are a go-getter. You are strong and confident.
3274,14,14,Sharon Marsh,You're right.
3275,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Tell me again about the women who you do not like.
3276,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Well, Linda Stotch is a real gossiper and Tammy Bretts at work is just a know-it-all."
3277,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Oh you are so witty and alarmingly insightful. [two beeps] How about a quick workout?
3278,14,14,Sharon Marsh,[takes off her sunglasses] A workout? Right now?
3279,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Just a quickie. You can do it.
3280,14,14,Sharon Marsh,I don't really like working out in public.
3281,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"Come on. You can do it. [Sharon thinks about it, then picks up the weight with her left hand and shakes it. At first she keeps it at a distance, but soon shakes it normally] That's it. Good. Keep it up. Feel the burn. Harder. Faster. [Sharon does as told] You are amazing. Switch arms. [Sharon switches] Oh that's it. Yes. You are getting really good at this. You are capable of anything. Harder, faster. [Sharon does as told] I said faster. More. Do it. You are almost there. Home stretch. Oh yes. [a ring and two squirts] Your workout is finished. Your cab fare. [pours out some fare onto Sharon's left hand] Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]"
3282,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,"We really think this is gonna work, Stan. All we have to do is convince your dad that his cooking sucks, right?"
3283,14,14,Stan Marsh,He's not going to listen to us! We already tried!
3284,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,"He won't listen to us, but he would listen to- Gordon Ramsay."
3285,14,14,Eric Cartman,"[on stilts, dressed as Ramsay] Oy! Bebebebebebebe."
3286,14,14,Stan Marsh,"That's stupid, Cartman."
3287,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,He does kind of look like him dude. And Kenny thinks Cartman's Gordon Ramsay impersonation is really good.
3288,14,14,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, it's really good.)"
3289,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Let's hear it, Cartman!"
3290,14,14,Eric Cartman,"Riiight. Simple. Rustic. Ya? Wake up! Jesus! Fuck me. You're not a fucking chef! Hoi, right, good, ya. Make a nice, simple, beef Wellington. You're fucking taking a piss ya? Fuck me! You can't cook!"
3291,14,14,Stan Marsh,"You guys, my dad is retarded, but not that retarded."
3292,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[enters the room] Hey Stan, have you seen my- Oh my God it's Gordon Ramsay! [backs out the door quickly and hides behind the door. Stan follows him out] Stan! Do you know who that is in there?! That's the Gordon Ramsay!"
3293,14,14,Stan Marsh,"...Uh yeah Dad, he'd like to talk to you."
3294,14,14,Randy Marsh,Talk to me?! Oh Jesus!
3295,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You have not worked out in seven hours.
3296,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh God, not right now."
3297,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Come on. Let's get to it.
3298,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Ugh, I'm tired."
3299,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You have not worked out in seven hours.
3300,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, where is that sleep mode button?"
3301,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Cannot go to sleep mode. You need to work out first. Come on. Just really fast?
3302,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Ugghh.
3303,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,Come on. It won't take long. Just a quick workout. Come on. Please.
3304,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[sighs] All right. Fine. [a few moments later, with the lights on, she begins shaking the weight]"
3305,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"That's it. Good. [Sharon sighs] A little faster. Harder. [Sharon simply switches arm position, but doesn't shake any faster] Come on. Get into it. That's it. Now switch arms. [Sharon switches] You are so attractive and you have interesting things to say. [Sharon shakes the weight faster, but soon has to support her left arm with her right hand] Come on. You are almost there. Faster. Do it faster. [ding, two squirts, some change comes out] Now going to sleep mode. [powers down]"
3306,14,14,Sharon Marsh,[relieved] Ahhh.
3307,14,14,Eric Cartman,"[still dressed as Ramsay] What the fuck kind of cook do you think you are?! Are you having a laugh, ey? Hey, you got your fucking head up your arse, don't you?!"
3308,14,14,Randy Marsh,Yes chef!
3309,14,14,Eric Cartman,"Give up, you wanker! You fucking can't cook for shit!"
3310,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Alright Dad, Gordon Ramsay said you suck. It's time to give up."
3311,14,14,Randy Marsh,"No, Stan! No, Chef! This is my dream!"
3312,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Dad! You aren't ever going to become a celebrity chef, Dad! Give up on your dream! [another camera crew comes in, with another chef]"
3313,14,14,Bobby Flay,"Uh, excuse me. Randy Marsh?"
3314,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Yes, I- Oh my God, it's Bobby Flay! Stan, that's Bobby Flay!"
3315,14,14,Bobby Flay,I heard that Gordon Ramsay had taken an interest in your cafeteria food. So now I would like to challenge you to a school cafeteria food throwdown!
3316,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, are you serious?? [fist pump] Yes, yes!"
3317,14,14,Announcer,"A culinary battle royale is set to explode here in a school cafeteria. Will it be the simple, rustic cafeteria food of the challenger, or will the Iron Chef reign supreme?"
3318,14,14,Stan Marsh,"Hey no, no. All you people get out of here."
3319,14,14,Jamie Oliver,"[appears] Hold on. Wait. School cafeteria food needs to be healthy. [begins to cry] Why, why won't people listen to me?"
3320,14,14,Randy Marsh,Jamie Oliver!
3321,14,14,Announcer,"And our celebrity sous-chefs, Mario Batali, Paula Deen [she waves], and Giata De Laurentiis with her perky tats and gigantic head."
3322,14,14,Kyle Broflovski,Can I just get some Goddamned tater tots?
3323,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"""Your room is being serviced""? Ugh, oh well. [enters the room and finds the maid working out with the Shake Weight] Uhh, excuse me?"
3324,14,14,Rosemary,"Oh, [turns around] uh no, no, [tosses the Shake Weight onto the bed] sorry. I done with cleaning, [runs to her cleaning tray and exits with it] thank you. Please, sorry. [after she leaves Sharon drops her shopping bag and walks to the bed. She crosses her arms and looks at the Shake Weight angrily]"
3325,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,...What's the big deal? She wanted to work out. You never want to work out. I just needed help going to sleep. Mode. ...What? ...What? Come on. What? You are amazing and irreplaceable. What? How about a quick workout? What? [moments later Sharon is on the phone with the manufacturer]
3326,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[pacing back and forth] Yeah, I don't care, I just wanna find out how to return my Shake Weight!"
3327,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,This is ridiculous. Give Shake Weight a break.
3328,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Because I want to return it now! I need to know the address of your company.
3329,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are enticing and lovely. Tell me again about the women you do not like.
3330,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"I don't care how long I've had it, I want my money back!"
3331,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,You are so forthcoming and delightful. Tell me about which woman at work makes you the angriest. [Sharon stops and glares at it.]
3332,14,14,Announcer,"Tonight, a school cafeteria in Middle America is the stage for a heavyweight culinary battle. The very best of the best will cook off to find out who... can make the best school cafeteria food. It's... the Hell's Kitchen Nightmares Iron Top Chef Cafeteria Throwdown Ultimate Cookoff Challenge!"
3333,14,14,Randy Marsh,[walking with a huge metal pot past Mario Batali] Behind you!
3334,14,14,Announcer,"[looks at Giata De Laurentiis, then turns to face the camera] Whose cafeteria food will win? These chefs are cooking their hearts out and bringing their A-game to serve the kids of this elementary school. [the cafeteria is shown full of kids] These kids have now been waiting over twelve hours for their lunch. Over at the prep station Jamie Oliver is crying again."
3335,14,14,Jamie Oliver,[on the floor] Kids' food should be healthy. Why ain't it healthy?
3336,14,14,Announcer,And back in the kitchen the challenger appears to have lost something.
3337,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[walking around, frantic] Where is it, where is it?? I must have left it at home! [leaves the kitchen, goes through the cafeteria, and leaves] I'll be right back!"
3338,14,14,Announcer,The challenger has left the cafeteria to find his most important ingredient.
3339,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Crème fraîche. Crème fraîche. [comes in through the garage and goes to the refrigerator, opens it, and rifles through the food] Where is it?! Where is it?! [goes to the sofa in the living room and takes off the cushions] Dammit, where is that crème fraîche?! [runs upstairs and into the master bedroom. He goes to the dresser and rifles through the top drawer] Where did I leave that fucking crème fraîche?! It has to be somewhere!"
3340,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"[appearing at the doorway] Randy, I'm back."
3341,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[looks over his shoulder] Oh, thank God! [quickly walks up to her] Sharon! Have you seen my crème fraîche??"
3342,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, we should talk."
3343,14,14,Randy Marsh,I don't have time! I'm cooking right now!
3344,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, I don't want our marriage to fail. I don't know how to fix what's wrong, but please, can't we just go to bed and start fresh in the morning?"
3345,14,14,Randy Marsh,"You don't understand, Sharon! I've got Gordon Ramsay up my ass, Bobby Flay out to kick my ass, and the whole world's gonna be watching! I can't sleep! I haven't slept for days!"
3346,14,14,Sharon Marsh,What'd you say?
3347,14,14,Randy Marsh,"[stops searching and crosses his arms] I can't sleep, Sharon! I'm in work mode!"
3348,14,14,Sharon Marsh,Can I try something?
3349,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh... Sharon, what are you? Oh! Ohhhohoho, oh. Oh wow! A nice old-fashioned. [Stan walks into view] Oh that, oh that's good! Oh that's it. Yeah! [Stan stops and looks at the door] Now uh, switch arms. [Stan looks away, trying to make sense of what he's hearing] Oohh that's good. Really good. Wow! How'd you get so good at this? [Stan figures it out, turns, and walks away] You're amazing! That's it! Faster! Faster! Awwwgh! ...Awwwww. Awwwww. Haven't had an old-fashioned in a long time. [yawns] Ugh, I'm tired."
3350,14,14,Sharon Marsh,You gonna go back to the kitchen?
3351,14,14,Randy Marsh,"Oh no, fuck that. I'm gonna go to sleep, babe. Here, do you need some money or anything?"
3352,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"No, I'm good, thanks. [smiles]"
3353,14,14,Randy Marsh,"I'll get my old job back tomorrow. Cooking's dumb. I'm just... really sleepy. [closes his eyes] Love you, Sharon. [farts, and he's asleep. Sharon remembers something and goes downstairs.]"
3354,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,I guess my work here is finished.
3355,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Shake Weight, you aren't really workout equipment at all, are you?"
3356,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"Marriage is important. Keep your man happy. When things are going bad, there's nothing like an old-fashioned to ease his stress."
3357,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"I'll remember that now, thanks to you."
3358,14,14,Shake Weight Commercial Woman 1 and 2,"It has been nice getting to know you. How about a quick workout, for old times' sake? Just kidding. I must be going now. Another lovely woman needs me. Goodbye, customer."
3359,14,14,Sharon Marsh,"Goodbye, Shake Weight."
