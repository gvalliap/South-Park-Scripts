0,6,13,Stan Marsh,O Great Wizard of Gregendath. What quest do you ask of this Ranger and Paladin?
1,6,13,Eric Cartman,Only one thing can save our kingdom. You must bring me: a piece of pecan pie with toffee ice cream and magic shell. Hurry now!
2,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"That quest sucks, Cartman! Think of another one!"
3,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[entering] Uh, boys, [the boys look up] Butters' parents want to borrow The Lord of the Rings video we rented. Could you take it over to them?"
4,6,13,Stan Marsh,You're sending us on... a quest? You ask of us to take the one video to the House of Butters?
5,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, whatever."
6,6,13,Eric Cartman,It shall be a long journey with many dangers on the way.
7,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"But if the tape must be brought to the House of Butters, who else can do it?"
8,6,13,Stan Marsh,"[reaches out and receives the tape] Very well, we shall embark on this quest immediately, father! Come, warriors!"
9,6,13,Stan Kyle Cartman,Ho! [they head out the front door. Randy moves away from the stairs and towards Sharon on the sofa]
10,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[snuggles up to her] Hmmm, that gets rid of them."
11,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oooh, you're a little frisky, aren't you?"
12,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, well uh, The Lord of the Rings wasn't the only thing I rented from the video store. [holds up a VHS case] I also rented... a porno."
13,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oho, you little devil."
14,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[softly, sensually] You wanna go watch?"
15,6,13,Stan Marsh,How shall we journey to the house of Butters? Through the mines of Endor or over the mountains of Grog?
16,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[notices something and gasps] Look out! Here comes the great dragon of Perengraph!
17,6,13,Eric Cartman,Don't worry! I am the great wizard Motortart. I can shield us from the dragon's fire. [a car passes by and Cartman fires away at it with his staff]
18,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Good job, wizard."
19,6,13,Eric Cartman,"And so the party journeyed onward: the great Wizard, the skillful Ranger, and the covetous Jew."
20,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm a Paladin, Cartman!"
21,6,13,Eric Cartman,Jews can't be Paladins.
22,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Hey there, cowboy."
23,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[holds up the video and turns to Sharon] You ready for some hot, steamy fun?"
24,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"[smiling, right index finger against her chin] You bet I am."
25,6,13,Randy Marsh,"The guys at the office told me I had to rent this porno. They said, ""this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made."" [puts the video into the player]"
26,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"[now reclining on the bed, running her finger along the bedsheets] Mmm, sounds good."
27,6,13,Randy Marsh,"I love that lingerie. [opens his nightgown to reveal a purple cod piece, then in a low voice] Yeah. You like that?"
28,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Mm, yeah baby."
29,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yeeaahhh. [reclines on the bed, facing her and holding the remote control] Alright, you ready?"
30,6,13,Sharon Marsh,Ready.
31,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Oh, yeah. [they turn to the TV. Randy starts the video]"
32,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,"[the video begins. Randy massages Sharon's arm] The story begins in ages past, in the deep regions of Middle-earth, where Scorn first thrived in the kingdom of Gelgelar."
33,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Aw man, I hate when pornos try to have a story."
34,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,Seven rings were cast and given to the races of Men.
35,6,13,Randy Marsh,Oh yeah. [begins caressing Sharon]
36,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,"Seven, to the races of Elves, five to the gloondock villagers of Gelgendor. [Sharon takes a good look at the video]"
37,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Wow, the production values are really good in this porno. [Randy takes a look]"
38,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yeah, it almost looks like... The Lord of the-- [jumps up and sits on the bed, aghast] Oh, my God! [quickly rises and turns off the TV, gets the video out, and reads] This is Lord of the Rings!"
39,6,13,Sharon Marsh,But then that mean..?
40,6,13,Randy Marsh,The boys have the hottest porno ever made.
41,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Oh, hello boys."
42,6,13,Stan Marsh,My father has asked that we bring you this copy of Lord of the Rings.
43,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Well, thank you very much, kind heroes."
44,6,13,Eric Cartman,Perhaps a reward is in order. Gold? Frankensteincense?
45,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Oh, but you are noble heroes. We know our thanks is enough. [closes the door. The boys leave]"
46,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Man, that's crap."
47,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Butters, [Butters stands up] look what we have for you to watch: The Lord of the Rings."
48,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[rushes up to meet his parents] Oh, boy! Finally I get to see it!"
49,6,13,Linda Stotch,"Now Daddy and I have to do our taxes, so you can watch this by yourself and not get scared?"
50,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Ah I won't get scared, Mom. Promise!"
51,6,13,Chris Stotch,"That's our man. Here you go. [hands the tape to Butters, who goes to the VCR and puts the tape in. The parents leave]"
52,6,13,Butters Stotch,Ooh la lolly! I finally get to see Lord of the Rings. [the video begins to play. A man and a woman are heard]
53,6,13,Evan Stone,"[softly] Spank that ass. [a few seconds later, a spanking is heard]"
54,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Whoa. [more sounds from the video] Neat-o. [more sounds, a few spankings] Well, this is good."
55,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oh my God, this is gonna be so embarrassing. ""Hi, Chris. Hi, Linda. We were just wondering if we could get our porno back."" [buries her face in her right hand]"
56,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Calm down, maybe the boys haven't gotten there yet."
57,6,13,Eric Cartman,And so the party returns home after completing their great quest.
58,6,13,Stan Marsh,The one tape was returned and South Park was again at peace. [a few seconds later some headlights shine on them]
59,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Quick! A monster of Rivendell!
60,6,13,Eric Cartman,Prepare for battle! [switch to the car]
61,6,13,Sharon Marsh,The boys! [Randy drives up to the boys and stops. Both he and Sharon jump out and rush up to them]
62,6,13,Randy Marsh,Boys! Boys! [stops] Where's the videotape?
63,6,13,Stan Marsh,We gave it to the parents of Butters as commanded by you.
64,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Awgh, I guess we have to go talk to 'em now."
65,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Well, wait a minute, uhhh, boys, do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast? [the boys look at each other]"
66,6,13,Eric Cartman,This sounds like a really important quest.
67,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Yes, it is. It is more important than anything I've ever asked you to do. You must retrieve the tape. But do not look at it, uh, for it... holds an evil power! Retrieve the tape, and return it to us at home. [falling into a fantasy accent] Do this, and you will be greatly rewarded."
68,6,13,Stan Marsh,Woww.
69,6,13,Eric Cartman,This... is so cool.
70,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns left] Gentlemen, we are off! [the boys turn back to walk to Butters' house. Randy watches them leave]"
71,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[rises and looks at Sharon] Okay, problem solved."
72,6,13,Woman,"...Oh my God, I'm so... Mmmm, mmm..."
73,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Oh golly. [his legs part and he points to his crotch] Hey, what's happening down there? [the basement door is heard opening and closing. Butters is fascinated by his body's reaction. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman come down the stairs. Cartman reaches for his crotch for tactile inspection]"
74,6,13,Stan Marsh,We have come to reclaim the one tape! [Butters sits up and Kyle goes for the tape]
75,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[walks up to Kyle] Wha-wha, what are you doing?! [Kyle removes it and puts it into the LotR case it came in]"
76,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[walks off. Butters is saddened] The Queen and King of Stan'ses house wish The Lord of the Rings returned to them.
77,6,13,Butters Stotch,"But it's the greatest movie I have ever seen. You guys were right. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Eh, you have to let me finish watching it."
78,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Nay, Butters! The one tape must be brought back to Stan'ses house. [the boys head up the stairs and out of the house. Butters opens the door and jumps at them]"
79,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Bwaagghh! [falls on his face, then quickly gets up and retreats]"
80,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! We said you can't watch it! We have a quest!
81,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Well, then... then let me go with you."
82,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, fine, Butters. But if you're gonna hang out with us, you have to play like Lord of the Rings. [Little does Kyle know what Butters' idea of LotR is. The boys turn to walk away]"
83,6,13,Butters Stotch,"Wuh, okay. [Butters jumps on Kyle's left arm and starts making love to it] Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah."
84,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[glares at Butters] Butters, what the hell are you doing?!"
85,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[a bit surprised] Playing Lord of the Rings. [resumes the love-making] Ugh, wegh, oh yeah."
86,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[smacks Butters with the tape, causing him to fall off] Get the hell off me! You're a freak, Butters! You can't play with us!"
87,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[on hands and knees, with renewed determination] Let me have the tape!"
88,6,13,Stan Marsh,"[takes the tape from Kyle] No, we have to return it! [the boys turn to walk away again. Butters crawls a few inches]"
89,6,13,Butters Stotch,My movie! [sorrowfully reaches out for it with left hand] My awesome cool movie. My... precious.
90,6,13,Eric Cartman,And so the tape was again retrieved to be brought back to Stan'ses house.
91,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,This copy of Lord of the Rings made the young Butters behave quite awfully.
92,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, and mine parents were acting strange about it, too."
93,6,13,Eric Cartman,Perhaps the one videotape has some power we have not foreseen. [three older boys ride up on their bikes and stop before the group. It's the sixth graders]
94,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"[gets off his bike and approaches the boys] Well, well, well! If it isn't Robin Hood and his Merry Men!"
95,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh, crap, the sixth graders!"
96,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,Whatcha got there?
97,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Nothing. [the sixth grader rips the tape out of Stan's hand] Hey, kid!"
98,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,[looks at the case] Lord of the Rings? Ha! That movie's gay!
99,6,13,Eric Cartman,You're gay!
100,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"[opens the case and looks at the tape] What the--? [reads the title: ""Back Door Sluts 9"" XXX] Whoa! [backs up to show the tape to his friends] Check it out, you guys!"
101,6,13,Sixth Graders 2 3,Whoa!
102,6,13,Stan Marsh,Give it back! We're on a quest to return it to my parents!
103,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,[approaches menacingly with the tape. Stan backs up] No way! We're keepin' this and watchin' it ourselves!
104,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,You can't keep it.
105,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"And what are three little fourth graders gonna do about it, huh?!"
106,6,13,Stan Marsh,There's four of us! Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body!
107,6,13,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
108,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Oh man, I can't wait to see this!"
109,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[aside to Stan] Dude, that video is making people act strange."
110,6,13,Eric Cartman,The one tape must be returned! [swats the tape out of the sixth grader's hands with the staff and watches as the tape falls into Stan's hands] Run! [the boys run away from the sixth graders]
111,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,Get 'em! [his two friends ride off after the boys. He picks up his bike and joins his friends]
112,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Oh, hello, Randy, Sharon."
113,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Uh... Chris, are the boys over here?"
114,6,13,Linda Stotch,"No, just Butters. He's been watching The Lord of the Rings downstairs."
115,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Oh, dear!"
116,6,13,Chris Stotch,What's the matter?
117,6,13,Randy Marsh,"We... [now nervous] Well, this is really sort of funny, but uh, we, we accidently put a...porno in The Lord of the Rings box. [Sharon shrugs, and both of them smile sheepishly]"
118,6,13,Linda Stotch,Ohh Godd!! [the Stotches panic and rush downstairs. The Marshes follow]
119,6,13,Chris Stotch,Butters?
120,6,13,Linda Stotch,Butters? [they notice the television] Butters!
121,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[peeks out from behind the sofa, in the shadow, then speaks in a raspy voice] The precious? [his parents turn to see him] Could you bring back my precious?"
122,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Butters, where is the movie you were watching?"
123,6,13,Butters Stotch,"[crawls out into view] They took his precious, took it away to watch without him. [sits up and puts his hands on his knees] He was really enjoying that movie, too! My... precious."
124,6,13,Randy Marsh,The boys must've come and saw what it was and... then taken it away somewhere.
125,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"[gravely] Oh, no. [Chris and Linda look back at them]"
126,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,We can't let those sixth graders get their hands on this videotape.
127,6,13,Eric Cartman,"I must say I agree. If this copy of The Lord of the Rings is tainted, it would not be safe in the wrong hands."
128,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"[nearby, off screen] I smell fourth graders!"
129,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh crap, dude!"
130,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Hide! [they jump over the massive root and hide in the pocket underneath. The lead sixth grader comes into view and sniffs the air. He hops off and looks around over the root. The boys look up in apprehension. The sixth grader sniffs around above them]
131,6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"[off screen] Hey. [the lead sixth grader whips around and goes to see who it is. It's his friend, in brown cap] I think I see something down the hill. [the lead sixth grader looks in that direction, then the sixth graders take off. The boys express relief after a few seconds]"
132,6,13,Stan Marsh,Ogh. [Cartman sighs silently]
133,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Phew. The one videotape is sought after indeed.
134,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Yeah. Butters, my parents, now the sixth graders."
135,6,13,Eric Cartman,"[rises and moves off] Come, guys. We must bring this all to the attention of the High Elf of Paragon."
136,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, the High Elf. He'll know what to do. [the boys leave the root]"
137,6,13,Randy Marsh,[debriefing Gerald and Sheila] And so that's the situation. All the boys are out there somewhere with a... pornographic videotape.
138,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh God, this, this is horrible!"
139,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"All right, calm down. Now, just how bad of a porno tape are we talking here? I mean, was it like Crotch Capers 3?"
140,6,13,Randy Marsh,I'm a...fraid it was... Backdoor Sluts 9. [he and Sharon hang their heads in shame]
141,6,13,Gerald Chris,Backdoor Sluts 9?!?
142,6,13,Linda Stotch,Is that bad?
143,6,13,Chris Stotch,Backdoor Sluts 9 makes Crotch Capers 3 look like Naughty Nurses 2!
144,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"I-it is the single most vile, twisted, dark piece of porn ever made. [Sheila gets angrier by the word]"
145,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,[slaps him] How the hell do you know?!
146,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"[shakily] I, uh, I-I-I read about it in People."
147,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"[now facing the Marshes] Oh, this is just great! How could you two be so careless?!"
148,6,13,Sharon Marsh,We're sorry.
149,6,13,Liane Cartman,"Well, Sheila, we can't shelter our boys forever from these things. Maybe it's okay for them to see an adult film."
150,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,Not without their parents to put it in a proper context! They won't understand what they're seeing!
151,6,13,Randy Marsh,"It-it can't hurt 'em that much, can it?"
152,6,13,Butters Stotch,[pops up outside and taps on a window] Precious. [the adults turn to see the window] Let me see my precious. [slides down the window and out of view] Plee-ee-ee-ease! [the adults just look on]
153,6,13,Eric Cartman,[waves his left hand around] Open. [nothing. He waves his left hand again] Bellog. [the door opens and Clyde appears]
154,6,13,Clyde Donovan,What do you guys want?
155,6,13,Stan Marsh,We must speak with the High Elf of Paragon.
156,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Oh. Okay, hang on a second. [steps back and closes the door, then reopens the door. He is now dressed as an elf. His staff is a small hoe] What troubles you?"
157,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,We have in our possession something of great power. [pulls out the videotape] It is... The Lord of the Rings.
158,6,13,Clyde Donovan,So? I have three copies. And the DVD with twelve hours of extra footage.
159,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Yes, but this is not a-- [stops, then reacts] Wow, twelve hours? ...Yes, but this is not a normal copy. It's making people act really strange. [hands the tape to Clyde]"
160,6,13,Eric Cartman,"We're seriously, High Elf. Something very evil lurks in this tape."
161,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Very well, I shall call the council together. Meet me in the Woods of Gathering behind Talangar the Black's house. And don't let my mom see you, 'cause I'll get in trouble."
162,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Thank you, High Elf of Paragon."
163,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Faragon, asshole! [closes the door. The boys leave the house and walk off]"
164,6,13,Eric Cartman,Clyde's a dick.
165,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Alright, everybody listen up! There's three snot-nosed little fourth graders out there who have a porno called Backdoor Sluts 9."
166,6,13,Other Sixth Graders,Ooooooh!
167,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"I checked it out on the Internet, and it said that Backdoor Sluts 9 is the most hard-core porno ever made."
168,6,13,Other Sixth Graders,Ahhhhh!
169,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"I have amassed this army of sixth graders to get the tape by any means necessary. Now, let's go get that porno! [the sixthh graders scream and charge out into the night on their bikes]"
170,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"And so that is the situation. The video may or may not have evil power. Kyle, would you bring it up here, please? [Kyle gets up, walks to the table, and stands the tape on it]"
171,6,13,Other boys,Ahhh.
172,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,That video could have been made by Sauron's evil f-...forces.
173,6,13,Craig Tucker,It could hold a mental spell of some kind.
174,6,13,Kevin,"[wearing a Star Wars Imperial stormtrooper helmet] Perhaps we could use it to strengthen our star cruisers. [the kids look at him. One shot has Tweek wearing a large coffee tin on his head, Pip dressed as an elf, a kindergartner wearing a Fett helmet, then one of Stan, Kyle and Cartman]"
175,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Kevin, god-damnit..! [Kevin looks around, then hops off his chair and leaves]"
176,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Look, until we see this tape's power for ourselves, we cannot risk giving it to anybody."
177,6,13,Stan Marsh,"But if we watch it, we could fall under its spell, too."
178,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"That is true. Only a Paladin with a high constitution should watch the tape. Therefore, I think it is a job for you, Talangar the Black."
179,6,13,Token Black,"[thinks about this, then leaves his seat] I am not scared. I'll go inside and watch the tape, [reaches the table and gets the tape] just for a few seconds. If I do not return in two minutes, send a party in after me. [walks towards the house] The fate of Middle-earth... is in my hands. [reaches the sliding door and enters the house, closing the door behnd him]"
180,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,Fourth graders! Give us that porn-o! [they go out of view. A moment later the Marsh car comes into view]
181,6,13,Sharon Marsh,Boys? [the Broflovskis are in the back seat]
182,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"[with her head out the window] Boys, we're not mad at you. We just wanna talk to you. [behind them is the Stotch car]"
183,6,13,Eric Cartman,Talangar the Black returns from watching the video. [the other boys stir]
184,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"What vice did you see on the videotape, Talangar? Is it the work of Sauron's magic? [Token returns to the table and places the tape there]"
185,6,13,Token Black,I'm not playing anymore. [walks off]
186,6,13,Stan Marsh,"[steps forward] Uh, well—Wait, what'd you see?"
187,6,13,Token Black,"[stops and turns] I don't know, I don't wanna know. I'm out. [claps his hands, then walks back into the house, sliding the door open and closed. The boys look on]"
188,6,13,Eric Cartman,"My God, this thing must really be powerful. [the boys turn to look at the tape]"
189,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,This tape makes people freak out wherever it goes.
190,6,13,Stan Marsh,What do we do with it?
191,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"One thing for sure, this tape cannot be trusted with anybody. This must be returned to the video store from whence it came."
192,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, where is the videotape rented from?"
193,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[picks up the tape and looks for the store name] Two Towers Video Store. I-in Conifer.
194,6,13,Tweek Tweak,Conifer? Walking there would take hours!
195,6,13,Clyde Donovan,There's no alternative. We have to return the tape before it causes more damage!
196,6,13,Kindergartner,I'll go.
197,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"Ha! We cannot trust something of that much power to a dwarf! Especially a kindergartner dwarf. [all the boys begin to chatter, nominating who should return the video]"
198,6,13,Craig Tucker,You're too young.
199,6,13,Eric Cartman,Quiet!
200,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"You guys, this is stupid."
201,6,13,Eric Cartman,You're acting like a bunch of assholes!
202,6,13,Stan Marsh,I will take it! [the boys quiet down and Stan approaches the table. He takes the tape in hand. Cartman closes his eyes in meditation] I will walk to the video store.
203,6,13,Clyde Donovan,"It is too far and too dangerous to go alone. Take with you the wizard [Cartman], the dwarf [the kindergartner], the warrior [Craig], the cleric [Jimmy], and the Jew [Kyle]."
204,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[flashes anger] Paladin!
205,6,13,Clyde Donovan,Very well. You shall be the Fellowship of The Lord of the Rings. Good luck. I have to go home now before I get in trouble.
206,6,13,Tweek Tweak,Me too.
207,6,13,Other boys,"[agreeing] Yeah, yeah, yeah."
208,6,13,Craig Tucker,Only the six of us are to go?
209,6,13,Stan Marsh,"No, no, there's seven of us. Kenny's soul is still trapped in Cartman's body, remember?"
210,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, stupid. [higher pitch] Yeah. Luckily, Cartman's body is big enough for the both of us. [a bit lower] Shut up, Kenny."
211,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,So it was that the heroes traveled many miles to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
212,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,We have reached the Great Pass of Mount Ururalak.
213,6,13,Craig Tucker,Look out! [a small avalanche of snow appears in front of them]
214,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[gasps a little] We were almost killed.
215,6,13,Eric Cartman,A dark wizard must be trying to stop us!
216,6,13,Stan Marsh,True. Someone or something doesn't want this video returned to the video store.
217,6,13,Token s Father,Oh. Hello everybody.
218,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Steve, uh, we heard that a bunch of the kids were over here a little while ago."
219,6,13,Token s Mother,"Well yes, I believe they were, but they've gone. What's the matter?"
220,6,13,Randy Marsh,"We think our boys might be showing other chiildren a, uh... pornographic tape."
221,6,13,Steve Williams and wife,What? But Token's never seen a porno before. He wouldn't know what to—Oh God! [rushes to look for Token]
222,6,13,Token s Mother,Token! [the other parents rush in]
223,6,13,Token s Mother,Token? Did the boys come over and... show you a movie? [no answer]
224,6,13,Steve Williams and wife,"Token? [no answer, long pause] Alright, Token. We know you must be very confused about what you saw. [no response, long pause]"
225,6,13,Randy Marsh,"[kneels next to Token] Yes, uh... you see, Token... that was called a pornographic film. I-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse. [no response, long pause] Well, y-you see, when a, when a man and a woman fall in love, the man puts his penis in the woman's vagina. It's called love-making, and it's part of being in love."
226,6,13,Token Black,"[no response, long pause] ...And when the woman has four penises in her at the same time, then stands over the men and pees on them, is that part of being in love too? [no response] Five midgets, spanking a man... covered in Thousand Island dressing. Is that making love?"
227,6,13,Steve Williams and wife,"Jesus, what kind of porno is that?"
228,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,It was Backdoor Sluts 9.
229,6,13,Steve Williams and wife,"Oh, Jesus, not that one! [his wife gives him an angry look]"
230,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, Gerald, poor Kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid."
231,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Uh, Token, this is very important: do you know where the boys went with the naughty tape?"
232,6,13,Craig Tucker,We're entering the limits of Bailey. Everyone stay close.
233,6,13,Stan Marsh,Perhaps the Great Ringworm of Bailey is about.
234,6,13,Kindergartner,Ringworms are no match for a dwarf.
235,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Guys, we shall slay the Ringworm and take his bounty of treasure! [they pass a yard on which some kids are playing] For that is the way of the--"
236,6,13,Boy 1,I shall put the magic spell on you!
237,6,13,Boy 2,"I have blocked your spell, wizard!"
238,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, what are you guys doing? [the Bailey kids turn and look]"
239,6,13,Boy 3,We're playing Harry Potter.
240,6,13,Eric Cartman,[after a few moments of thought] Ha!! Fags! [the boys move on. They soon pass a Country Café]
241,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[suddenly wary] You guys. Somebody is following us.
242,6,13,Eric Cartman,It's Butters.
243,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Butters?
244,6,13,Eric Cartman,"Yes. He's been following us for like two hours. [behind the six boys, at some distance, is Butters, skulking along in the shadows]"
245,6,13,Butters Stotch,The precious videotape. L-let the Butters see it.
246,6,13,Eric Cartman,Just ignore him; maybe he'll go away.
247,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Hey fellas, mind if we take a little re-rest?"
248,6,13,Eric Cartman,"There's no time for rest, sorcerer! Keep up! [the sound of sixth graders is heard in the distance. The boys look around to find the direction of the sound. The sixth graders appear in the horizon behind them and ride in quickly, screaming all the while]"
249,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,They are coming. [a shot of the sixth graders] You guys go on ahead.
250,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy, are you sure?"
251,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"Go! [the other five boys take off, leaving Jimmy to face the sixth graders alone. He turns and stares down the approaching throng] You shall not...pah..? You shall not..puh... [the sixth graders draw closer] You shall not paah... [a shot of the young bikers, then a distance shot of Jimmy, then a shot of the young bikers, a shot of Jimmy, a shot of the young bikers, a quick shot of Jimmy, then the sixth graders as they reach Jimmy] You shall not pa--! [the sixth graders take shots at him as they pass by. He falls and gets up] You shall not paah--! [struck down again, rises, is struck down, rises...] You shall not puh-uh-uh-- [falls again. The last of the sixth graders passes by, and Jimmy stands up, all beat up, with tire tracks and bruises on his face and a black eye] You shall not pass. [falls down]"
252,6,13,Stan Marsh,Jimmy didn't stop them!
253,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,They're gonna take The Lord of the Rings from us.
254,6,13,Eric Cartman,Quick! Cross the river! Sixth graders can't stand water!
255,6,13,Craig Tucker,What? That's stupid.
256,6,13,Eric Cartman,"I'm a high-ranking white wizard, Craig, and I say sixth graders are opposed to water!"
257,6,13,Craig Tucker,Whatever. I'm going back to play with the Harry Potter kids. [walks off]
258,6,13,Kindergartner,Me too. [follows Craig]
259,6,13,Eric Cartman,Go ahead and play Harry Butthole Pussy Potter!
260,6,13,Stan Marsh,Just get across the river! They're coming! [the three remaining boys scramble across the river. The sixth graders arrive. Two of them stop their tires by performing wheelies and landing their bikes back on the road. The lead sixth grader rides up between them]
261,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,What the hell is wrong with you guys?! Get the tape!
262,6,13,Sixth Grader 4,"Dude, I don't wanna get wet."
263,6,13,Sixth Grader 5,"Yeah, I don't really like the water."
264,6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"Besides, if our bikes get wet, their chains'll rust."
265,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Oh, god-damnit. Alright, come on. We'll find a bridge. [the bikers ride off]"
266,6,13,Lord of the Rings Narrator on Videotape,The quest continued to return The Lord of the Rings to the video store.
267,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Man, we should have never crossed that stupid river."
268,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah. Good job, wizard fat ass! Now we're totally lost."
269,6,13,Eric Cartman,"We're not lost, Jewgar of Jewlingrad, we just don't know where we are! [twitched] That's what ""lost"" means, stupid! Kenny, shut your goddamned mouth!"
270,6,13,Stan Marsh,This is great! We're in the middle of nowhere and nobody knows what direction the video store is in!
271,6,13,Butters Stotch,[crawls up to them] The Butters knowses.
272,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Oh brother!
273,6,13,Butters Stotch,The video store. Yesss. Not far from here. We can show you wheres it is.
274,6,13,Stan Marsh,Where?!
275,6,13,Butters Stotch,"First, just let Butters sseee the precious."
276,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"No, Butters. Look what it's done to you. It's made you even lamer than before."
277,6,13,Eric Cartman,If that was possible.
278,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Tell us how to get to the video store, Butters, or else we're gonna kick your ass!"
279,6,13,Butters Stotch,[puts up his arms to shield himself] Ha-a-a. No hurtses the Butters. [squats with his arms hanging over his knees] We will show you the way. Yesss. This way it is. [walks forward in a squatting manner]
280,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"This is awful! I just know with every passing minute, little Kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts!"
281,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, we'll find them. A-and then we'll try to put what they saw into context."
282,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"Look! There's one of the boys now! [before them is Jimmy, fallen and asleep in the middle of the road. Randy steps on the brakes] Jimmy!"
283,6,13,Randy Marsh,[the adults jump out of their cars and approach him] Jimmy! Jimmy! [Jimmy awakens and looks up] Where did the boys go with the porno tape?
284,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,They're taking it to the vi... the vi... the vii...
285,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Come on Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time."
286,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,They took it back to the video s... the video s...
287,6,13,Randy Marsh,The video sandwich?
288,6,13,Chris Stotch,The video stockyard.
289,6,13,Randy Marsh,"What's a video stockyard, Jimmy?"
290,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"No, the video suh... the video s...tih..."
291,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,Stinger?
292,6,13,Chris Stotch,"Staples. They went to the video Staples. Where's that, Jimmy?"
293,6,13,Jimmy Valmer,"N-n-no, you retards! The video s...tore!"
294,6,13,Adults,The video store! [they go to their cars]
295,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,Hurry! Hurry!
296,6,13,Randy Marsh,"I know where it is! [they get in their cars and peel off. (""When did the Broflovski station wagon arrive?"") Jimmy is left where he was when they arrived]"
297,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Oh no! They're closed!
298,6,13,Stan Marsh,Closed?
299,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,[off screen] There they are!
300,6,13,Sixth Grader 6,[the throng of sixth graders approach] Don't let them turn it back into the video store!
301,6,13,Eric Cartman,We're screwed.
302,6,13,Stan Marsh,"[seeing a way out of this mess] Wait. A drop box. [goes to it and pulls down the door] Quick, Kyle, drop the movie in!"
303,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Finally. [he and Cartman move towards the box. Butters looks on] It's over.
304,6,13,Butters Stotch,[now moving] Precious. Must have our precious. Waagh! [jumps on Kyle and runs off with the tape]
305,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Butters! No!
306,6,13,Butters Stotch,[now in the middle of the parking lot] Now wees hases it! [the sixth graders close in]
307,6,13,Stan Marsh,They're coming!
308,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,[goes after Butters and tries to wrest the tape from him] It has to go back!
309,6,13,Butters Stotch,It wantses to stay with the Butter kid.
310,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"[a foot away] There it is! Give me that tape! [Butters holds on tight to the tape, smiling wide.]"
311,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,"[picks Butters up and carries him off] Let go of the tape, Butters!"
312,6,13,Butters Stotch,I'll never let go! [Stan opens the drop box and holds the door open]
313,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Fine! [tosses him into the drop box]
314,6,13,Butters Stotch,Precious! [Stan closes the door. The lead sixth grader leaps off his bike and rushes to the drop box]
315,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Nooo! [reaches in and fishes around for it] No, nooo! [walks off in disgust and hits the window] Damnit! [the other sixth graders arrive]"
316,6,13,Sixth Grader 2,"Aw man, now we'll never see the hot action."
317,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,You stupid little fourth graders!
318,6,13,Eric Cartman,The tape is returned to which it came. Its power over you shall fade as well.
319,6,13,Kyle Broflovski,Middle-earth is again safe.
320,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Yeah? Well, that's not gonna stop us from kicking your asses!"
321,6,13,Stan Marsh,Uh-oh.
322,6,13,Randy Marsh,Boys! Boys!
323,6,13,Sixth Grader 1,"Crap! Parents! [gets on his bike and turns away] Come on, guys. [the sixth graders leave] We'll see you next time, fourthies!"
324,6,13,Eric Cartman,And perhaps they would. But for now the sixth grader army was defeated.
325,6,13,Randy Marsh,There you are!
326,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, Kyle! You're safe!"
327,6,13,Stan Marsh,"Oh hey guys, uh... We were just about to come home. We had to return the video."
328,6,13,Randy Marsh,"A-alright, now, now listen, kids. There's some things we need to put into context for you. You see, a man puts his penis into a woman's vagina for both love and pleasure. But sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each other's genitals in their mouths. [the boys are stunned] Uh, this is called ""69ing"" and it's normal."
329,6,13,Sharon Marsh,"See boys, a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it... feels good to have a man's penis inside of it."
330,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"That's right, but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things. Telephones, staplers, magazines. It's because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive, it's like a fun tickle."
331,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Now, on to double penetration, boys. You see, sometimes when a woman has sex with more than one man, each man makes love to a different orifice."
332,6,13,Randy Marsh,That's right. It's something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting.
333,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,It's also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other.
334,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do, but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it."
335,6,13,Gerald Broflovski,"Okay, boys. Do you have any questions? [the boys are still stunned, but one of them finally speaks]"
336,6,13,Stan Marsh,...Wow. [another long moment of stunned silence]
337,6,13,Randy Marsh,"Well, let's all get going."
338,6,13,Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah, come on boys. Time to get home. [the adults head for their cars, but the boys stay frozen in place]"
339,6,13,Chris Stotch,[turns around. Linda does as well] Wait a minute. Where's Butters?
340,6,13,Butters Stotch,[rises from the batch of videotapes that buried him] Wu-u-wees hases our preciouseses! Hases it... Hases it...
