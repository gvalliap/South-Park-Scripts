0,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[enters with Mr. Hat on his hand] You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?"
1,6,14,Principal Victoria,"Yes, Mr. Garrison. Have a seat. [Mr. Garrison takes a seat] Mr. Garrison, sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade."
2,6,14,Mr Garrison,[flatly] I'm aware of that.
3,6,14,Principal Victoria,"I wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences. It was wrong of us, and I want to make it up to you."
4,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Wow, that's... really great to hear."
5,6,14,Principal Victoria,"As you know, the position of Fourth Grade teacher has become available, and we'd like to offer YOU the job."
6,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[brightens] Oh, for real? You're not kidding?"
7,6,14,Principal Victoria,"We in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences, and we respect that."
8,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[rises from the chair with excitement] Oh, this is all just... this is a dream come true! [shakes her hand] Thank you, Principal Victoria! I'll do a great job!"
9,6,14,Principal Victoria,I know you will. [Garrison turns around and walks away smiling]
10,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[turns around] You're sure this is for real? I mean, I'm not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow."
11,6,14,Principal Victoria,"[slight chuckle] It's for real, Mr. Garrison."
12,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[slight chuckle, turns around and walks out the door] Oh-ho, great!"
13,6,14,Principal Victoria,With all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now. You'd be able to sue us for millions of dollars.
14,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Right uh- [stops in his tracks at the door's entrance, his smile turns to wonder. He turns around] Wha- ...what was that?"
15,6,14,Principal Victoria,"Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed. You know, we fire you for acting gay next time, you'd be able to sue the school district for ...lots of money."
16,6,14,Mr Garrison,"...Oh right, right, right, I... Huh-... how much money, exactly?"
17,6,14,Principal Victoria,"[busy doing paperwork] Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think."
18,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Yeh-you don't say. [strokes his chin] Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria. [walks out and closes the door] Holy Moly! I've gotta find a way to get fired for being gay!"
19,6,14,Mr Mackey,"M'kay kids, I know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher, Ms. Choksondik. [the kids erupt in laughter]"
20,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,Funny.
21,6,14,Mr Mackey,"BUT... the principal has finally hired a teacher to take her place. So I want you all to give your best behavior to your new Fourth Grade teacher, Mr. Garrison. [the door opens and Garrison enters]"
22,6,14,Kids,AWWWW!!!
23,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,Not him!
24,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Thank you, Mr. Mackey."
25,6,14,Mr Mackey,"[walks toward the door] Good luck, m'kay."
26,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, now for those of you who are new, my name is [writes on the board] Mr. Garrison."
27,6,14,Butters Stotch,"Where is Mr. Hat, sir?"
28,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Well, I was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for Mr. Hat."
29,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,[rolls his eyes] Two-year-olds are too old for Mr. Hat.
30,6,14,Mr Garrison,"But it's okay because I found a new teacher's assistant. Say hello to... [the door opens again] Mr. Slave. [a strapping man enters. He wears a pink shirt, pale blue jeans; black leather vest, chaps and boots; police hat, strong jaw and mustache, and pouty lips]"
31,6,14,Mr Slave,[preens] Hi kids. Hm.
32,6,14,Mr Garrison,"So that's [writes on the board] Mr. Slave. [Mr. Slave poses] The teacher's assistant. [Mr Slave smooths his mustache, then his hat] Or, as I like to write for short, the Teacher's Ass."
33,6,14,Mr Slave,[throws his arms forward] Oh Jesus Christ.
34,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Okay, Mr. Slave. Go sit until I need you. [Mr. Slave goes to sit down. Garrison spanks him as he passes by]"
35,6,14,Mr Slave,Ugh.
36,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[leans towards Craig, who pays attention] Dude, I think that Mr. Slave guy might by a... [glances back] Pakistani."
37,6,14,Mr Garrison,"I'm not saying the rest of the school year will be easy. In fact, it's going to be long and hard. [does motions for both words - the palms facing each other and pulling apart, then two fists] Really long and really hard. [emphasizes the motions]"
38,6,14,Mr Slave,[at a small teacher's desk reading a magazine] Oh Jesus Christ.
39,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[gleefully] Eheh, the first thing we're gonna be learning about is communist Russia. [erases the name on the board and begins writing the topic, starting with an S]"
40,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[begins making a paper plane involuntarily] No, Kenny. What are you doing, Kenny?"
41,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[finishes writing ""STALIN""] Now, Stalin was a big silly when it came to..."
42,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[finishes the plane and aims it at Mr. Garrison] Kenny, no! Don't do it, Kenny! [fires the plane off. It hits the board and falls away]"
43,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[turns around and points] Eric, did you just throw a paper airplane?!"
44,6,14,Eric Cartman,"No, it was Kenny!"
45,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[arms akimbo] Very funny, Eric! Kenny's dead!"
46,6,14,Stan Marsh,"[coming to Cartman's defense] Yeah, but Cartman drank Kenny's remains, and now Kenny's soul is trapped in Cartman's body."
47,6,14,The Other Kids,Yeah.
48,6,14,Mr Garrison,"That does it! I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It's time for punishment! [reaches into his desk and pulls out a paddle, then strikes it against his left palm twice. He walks over to Mr. Slave and has him bend over] Take it Mr. Slave! [swats him three times on the ass]"
49,6,14,Mr Slave,[moves his head around] Oh-oh. Oh it hurts.
50,6,14,Mr Garrison,"I will [swat] NOT put up with [swat] TOM foolery in my [swat] CLASS room, children. [stands him up and straps a gag ball around Mr. Slave's face] Mr. Slave, put this rubber ball in your mouth. [bends Mr. Slave over his lap and swats him some more] Take that, Slavey! take it! [the kids look on, stunned. Mr. Garrison continues the swats] This'll get me fired for sure. [smiles]"
51,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,I really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this month's book.
52,6,14,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Yes, and I really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate America."
53,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Well I think in the fourth chapter, when uh Nancy Drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleader's locker, well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage. [Sharon sips some coffee, a door opens]"
54,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,So full of metaphor.
55,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey guys, can we talk to you? [with him are Stan, Cartman, Butters, and Tweek]"
56,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Oh, hi boys."
57,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,How was school?
58,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Uhh, not cool."
59,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"That's great. We're having our book of the month club meeting, so why don't you boys go outside and play?"
60,6,14,Stephen and Linda Stotch,"Was it me, or did you all think that Nancy Drew solved the riddle of Elephant Mountain a little too easily? [a burst of chatter follows]"
61,6,14,Stan Marsh,"No, no, he said not cool. We got our new teacher today; it's, it's Mr. Garrison, our old third grade teacher."
62,6,14,Chris,Uh huh.
63,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, he has this new teacher's assistant, and uh and they're both... totally gay."
64,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Kyle! You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!
65,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay."
66,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"[displeased] Aw I'm surprised at you, Stanley. I really thought you knew how to accept people for what they were."
67,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Yeah, but Dad-"
68,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"No buts, Stanley! We're not raising our kids to be discriminators!"
69,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,That's right! I think it's time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! [Gerald crosses his arms. The kids look at each other]
70,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,[a woman greeting the families inside the museum] Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance. Here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in America. [Cartman yawns loudly. Liane smacks him across the back of his head]
71,6,14,Eric Cartman,Ey!
72,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"[leads them through the museum] Now, did you know that words we use can show intolerance? [leads the group to a tunnel entrance] Let's begin our tour with a walk through our Tunnel of Prejudice, to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against. [motions for the boys to enter, and the boys enter]"
73,6,14,Voice,"[the words it says appear on the walls of the tunnel as it says them, then disappear] QUEER. BEANER. CHINK. NIGGER. HEEB. FAGGOT. CRACKER. SLOPE. [the boys are suitably shocked as they move along the tunnel's people mover, but Cartman is grinning from ear to ear]"
74,6,14,Eric Cartman,"Aw man, this is awesome! [""JAP""]"
75,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,[at the other end of the tunnel with the parents] Now you know how it feels.
76,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[excited, runs up to the guide] I wanna ride again! I wanna ride again!"
77,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"[leads them into the Hall of Stereotypes] We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities. [leads them to the first exhibit] Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? [the stereotypes are exhibits, each one with its own spotlight]"
78,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"[walks up to another exhibit with Stan and Kyle] Ah, here's the Arab as a terrorist. [the Arab is holding a Kalashnikov rifle]"
79,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"That's right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don't we, kids?"
80,6,14,Butters Stotch,[sees a third exhibit] W-w-well there's an Asian over there with a calculator. [walks over to it. The others follow]
81,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"That's right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like ""All Asians are good at math"" is harmful to society."
82,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[over at a fourth exhibit, a man cowering over a bag of money] Look, a covetous Jew!"
83,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"[arrives with the others] Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed."
84,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"[notices a fifth spotlight and walks to it] Ah, here's a good one. [Stan walks up next to him] It's the stereotypical ""sleepy Mexican."" [a man sleeps under the spotlight sitting up next to a mop and bucket]"
85,6,14,Janitor,"[wakes up] Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it? [stands up and rubs the back of his neck]"
86,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,[in a low voice] Oh I'm sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.
87,6,14,Janitor,"Naw, man. I'm the janitor. I'm s'pose to be cleaning but I'm so tired. Ongh, so sleepy. [walks off with the mop and bucket]"
88,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"[leads them into the Tolerance Discovery Lab] This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays [they measure tolerance I.Q.], because you see, being tolerant you must also respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight, [moves her arms towards Cartman] like this young man here."
89,6,14,Eric Cartman,Ey!
90,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"You other boys have probably called this young man names like ""tubby,"" or ""lardbutt,"" or ""fat tits,""..."
91,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"""Fat tits."" That's a good one."
92,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I have to remember that."
93,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"But you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that's his life choice."
94,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[strokes his chin and tries something out] I'm not fat, I have a different life choice."
95,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,And we won't belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.
96,6,14,Eric Cartman,"Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! [the adults chuckle]"
97,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,That's our Cartman. [Cartman grins]
98,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"Well, that's the end of our tour."
99,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?"
100,6,14,Stan Marsh,I guess.
101,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do. [notices someone nearby] Hey! What the hell are you doing? [it's a man smoking on the edge of the fountain]
102,6,14,Smoker,Oh I was just uh-
103,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,There's no smoking in the museum!
104,6,14,Smoker,But I'm not in the museum.
105,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"Get out of here, you filthy smoker! [the smoker rises and walks off]"
106,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah, dirty lungs!"
107,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!"
108,6,14,Chris,Dumbass!
109,6,14,Richard and Mrs. Tweek,Get out of here! [the smoker walks out of view]
110,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"Well, have a great day, everybody."
111,6,14,Chris,Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?
112,6,14,The Boys,Yeah.
113,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Okay, children, let's take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we're just gonna have to go on and learn more today. [sits on a corner of the desk] Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?"
114,6,14,Butters Stotch,It evaporates.
115,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react. [takes the tube in hand and walks over to Mr. Slave] Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let's look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please. [Mr. Slave looks up from his magazine, then assumes the position over his little desk and lowers his pants enough to show his ass] Now I'm gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave's tight ass. [steps backwards and inserts the tube. Mr. Slave starts to moan] The heat from Mr. Slave's ass will act as our new conductor of energy"
116,6,14,Mr Slave,AAH.
117,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Okay, now Butters, could you bring over Lemmiwinks for me please?"
118,6,14,Butters Stotch,Sure. [smiles and goes to get Lemmiwinks]
119,6,14,Stan Marsh,"[sensing what's about to happen] Oh, no, no, no no no no."
120,6,14,Mr Garrison,[gets Lemmiwinks from Butters] Newton was the first to discover that for every action there's a reaction - thank you Butters. Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave's ass? [the kids are all aghast] Well let's see. [lifts up the Bunsen tube and sends the gerbil on its way down]
121,6,14,Mr Slave,"AAH. [the gerbil enters Mr. Slave's lower intestine and comes across the skeleton of another gerbil. It turns back immediately and runs for the anal opening. Mr. Garrison pulls the tube out and the sphincter snaps shut, trapping the gerbil inside. It tries to claw its way out] AAH. [moves his head around] Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!"
122,6,14,Butters Stotch,[realizing what just happened] Lemmiwinks? NO!
123,6,14,Chef,"Hello there, children!"
124,6,14,The Boys,Hey Chef.
125,6,14,Chef,How's it goin'?
126,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,Bad.
127,6,14,Chef,Why bad?
128,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Chef, we're intolerant. [beat]"
129,6,14,Chef,...Intolerant of who?
130,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Gays, I guess."
131,6,14,Chef,"Now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people, children? [arms akimbo] I thought you knew better."
132,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Well we didn't think we were, but Mr. Garrison has this new assistant, and we're really uncomfortable around him."
133,6,14,Chef,"Children, a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves. You have to ask yourself, ""What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes me uncomfortable?"""
134,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, I guess it's mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave's ass."
135,6,14,Chef,"Right. And you see, children, that's why you need to- Whoa! What?!"
136,6,14,Stan Marsh,Are we homophobes now?
137,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't wanna be gay bashers, Chef."
138,6,14,Chef,"Children, there's a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison! Do you understand that??"
139,6,14,Stan Marsh,N-no?
140,6,14,Chef,You children just take your lunches. I'm gonna have a talk with the principal.
141,6,14,Eric Cartman,"I'll take three lunches today, please."
142,6,14,Chef,"You don't need three lunches, Eric! You're fat enough as it is!"
143,6,14,Eric Cartman,"It is my life choice, Chef, and if you don't tolerate it I'll report you to the SEC. [Chef is puzzled]"
144,6,14,Mr Garrison,"That was a brilliant idea, having me put a gerbil up your ass, Mr. Slave. [laughs] Now we'll get fired for sure!"
145,6,14,Mr Slave,[nonchalantly] Well it wasn't the first small animal I put up my ass.
146,6,14,Principal Victoria,"[over the P.A. system] Mr. Garrison to the principal's office, please?"
147,6,14,Mr Garrison,That's it! They're gonna fire me for being gay! Twenty-five million here we cooome. [shimmies out the door]
148,6,14,Mr Slave,"Don't forget, I get half. Oooooh! [feels the gerbil try again to claw its way out of his ass] Oooooh, Jesus Christ. [scratches his ass. The gerbil runs one way, then back to the sphincter. A specter appears and stops the gerbil in its tracks. It's a Frog King. The two stand motionless for a few seconds]"
149,6,14,Frog King,"Lemmiwinks, you must find a way out of this place, or you will surely die. [the gerbil just stands there] This way has been closed off by the Great Sphincter. To escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach. [the gerbil says nothing] Who am I? Just a friend. Heed my words, Lemmiwinks. Your time is running out. Make for the large intestine. All will be made clear then. [disappears. The gerbil turns around, scratches its chin, and begins its journey]"
150,6,14,Singer,"A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward, Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead.
The journey before you may be long and filled with woe
But you must escape the gay man's ass so your tale can be told.
Lemmiwinks. Lehehemiwinks Lemmiwinks Lemmiwinks-"
151,6,14,Mr Garrison,"You wanted to see me, Principal Victoria?"
152,6,14,Principal Victoria,"Oh yes, uh, Mr. Garrison, have a seat"
153,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[nudges Chef] Oh dear, sounds like I'm gettin' fired. [hums some more and takes a seat]"
154,6,14,Principal Victoria,"Mr. Garrison, Chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit... uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods."
155,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[in anticipation, gets melodramatic] Oh no, you're firing me? Oh well, I can't stop being who I am. I can't help the way God made me. Guess I just have to go."
156,6,14,Principal Victoria,No no no we're not firing you.
157,6,14,Mr Garrison,...You're not?
158,6,14,Principal Victoria,"No, we're sending Chef to a tolerance seminar."
159,6,14,Chef,[steps forward] Sending Chef to a tolerance seminar?! You've got to be fuckin' crazy!!
160,6,14,Principal Victoria,"You demonstrate a lack of tolerance for Mr. Garrison's behavior. In fact, I believe you used the words ""sick queer"" to describe his conduct in class?"
161,6,14,Chef,He IS a sick queer!!
162,6,14,Mr Garrison,Yeah!
163,6,14,Principal Victoria,"I just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to Mr. Garrison before I send you away, Chef."
164,6,14,Chef,Kiss my black ass!! [Mr. Garrison is surprised]
165,6,14,Mr Mackey,"Parents, I had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers, m'kay?"
166,6,14,Stan Marsh,We're not staying in class another minute with those queermos!
167,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Well I really thought you boys learned something in the Museum of Tolerance, but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers!"
168,6,14,Butters Stotch,[still distraught] But they killed Lemmiwinks!
169,6,14,Chris,"Shut your mouth, Butters! You'll speak when spoken to!"
170,6,14,Butters Stotch,Yes sir.
171,6,14,Chris,"Mr. Mackey, we've done everything we can to raise compassionate children. We don't know where else to turn."
172,6,14,Mr Mackey,"Well there is an intensive seminar camp. It's a bit severe, but it might be the only way. M'kay?"
173,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,That sounds good to me.
174,6,14,Liane Cartman,Mee too.
175,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,"Then it's settled. Boys, you're going to tolerance camp."
176,6,14,Stan Marsh,Tolerance camp?
177,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,"[sternly] Welcome to tolerance camp. You are here because you would not accept people's differences. [a shot of the kids shows that Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters were not the only kids to refuse attending Garrison's class] Because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man. Well those days are now over. Here you vill verk, every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody. Here, intolerance... will not be tolerated."
178,6,14,Mr Garrison,God-damnit!
179,6,14,Mr Slave,How'd it go?
180,6,14,Mr Garrison,"This is unbelievable, Mr. Slave! It seems no matter what I do I can't get fired!"
181,6,14,Mr Slave,The principal didn't fire you?
182,6,14,Mr Garrison,No! The parents felt so bad that their kids didn't want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the Courageous Teacher award this Friday at the Museum of Tolerance!
183,6,14,Mr Slave,"Oh, Jesus Christ."
184,6,14,Mr Garrison,"I mean, I stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a Goddamn medal!"
185,6,14,Mr Slave,Well it sounds to me like the principal's just hiding things from everybody. What you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are.
186,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Oh well- [stops and thinks] Hey, that's right, Mr. Slave. [paces a bit] The parents have to see for themselves. [snaps his fingers] The awards ceremony! Well we'll put on a show they'll never forget!"
187,6,14,Mr Slave,"Oohoohoohoo, Jesus Christ. [rubs his belly, and the camera zooms in, cutting to the intestine. Lemmiwinks walks along, and a guitar is heard]"
188,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"Lemmiwinks journeyed a distance far and fast.
To find his way out of a gay man's ass.
The road ahead is filled with danger and fright
But push onward, Lemmiwinks, with all of your might."
189,6,14,Frog King,"[appears again before Lemmiwinks] Lemmiwinks, you are coming to the entrance of the small intestine. Now you must seek out the Sparrow Prince. [disappears. Lemmiwinks walks up the large intestine, going back and forth. Eventually it sees the Sparrow Prince and stops]"
190,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"The Sparrow Prince lies somewhere way up ahead.
Don't look back, Lemmiwinks, or you'll soon be dead.
Lemmiwinks, Lemmiwinks, the time is growing late
Slow down now and seal your fate."
191,6,14,Sparrow Prince,"I am the Sparrow Prince. Long has my spirit been trapped within this place. Before you lies the maze of the small intestine. One path leads to the stomach, the other to certain doom. Take with you this helmet and torch. [they appear and float toward Lemmiwinks] Let them be your guide. [Lemmiwinks puts it on and continues its journey]"
192,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"Take the magic helmet torch to help you light the way.
There's still a lot of ground to cross inside the man so gay.
Ahead of you lies adventure, and your strength still lies within.
Freedom from the Ass of Doom is the treasure you will win."
193,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Today we will be using the fingerpaint! You vill make a painting that shows people of different races and sexual orientations getting along. Fingerpaint. Fingerpaint! [the kids get busy fingerpainting] You vill not make any distinction between people of different colors! People with different sexual preferences! You vill accept everyone! [stops behind Kyle's right shoulder and swoops down to look at his paper] What are you fingerpainting?!
194,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh, a bear?"
195,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Ein bear?! Und bear has nothing to do with accepting people of different races!
196,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[trembling in fear] Eh I, I don't know what else to paint."
197,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,[takes Kyle's paper and rips it up] Start over! [puts his hand on the stack of papers next to Kyle] You will fingerpaint what we tell you! [takes a sheet from the stack and slams it down in front of Kyle] GO! [Kyle starts on a new picture] Faster. [the guard switches to the left shoulder without breaking his stare] Faster!

202,6,14,Mr Garrison,"There! I've done it, Mr. Slave. The perfect plan to get us fired. You finished your costume design yet?"
203,6,14,Mr Slave,"[scribbling on a notepad] Almost. I just have to get through a su- [grabs his stomach] Uh-huc, Jesus Christ."
204,6,14,Mr Garrison,What's the matter?
205,6,14,Mr Slave,"Mm, Just a bit of an upset stomach, I guess."
206,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Well here, take a Pepto pill. I can't have my teacher's ass under the weather. [hands Mr. Slave a glass of water and a pill]"
207,6,14,Mr Slave,"Eugh, Jesus Christ. [takes the pill and swallows it. The camera follows the pill down the esophagus toward the stomach. The pill lands in the pool of acid in the stomach. Lemmiwinks pops up from the pool]"
208,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"Lemmiwinks came to the stomach far.
 'Neath the depths of the lungs and heart."
209,6,14,A Catfish,"You chose your path wisely, Lemmiwinks. I am the Catatafish."
210,6,14,Singers (voiceover),Catatafish of the stomach's cove.
211,6,14,Catatafish,"If you answer this riddle, the esophagus will let you pass."
212,6,14,Singers (voiceover),Catatafish riddle will soom be told.
213,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Everything in order?
214,6,14,Camp Soldier,"Yes, mein Führer. Ve are making the prisoners make macaroni pictures that illustrate diversity in the verkplace."
215,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,"[looks at a paper with two people shaking hands and with ""DIVERSITY"" written above them] Eh-xcellent! [down below the kids continue with their pictures.]"
216,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,[Suddenly falls on his face] Oh.
217,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Kyle. [helps him up and tries to rouse him] Kyle, you have to keep making your macaroni pictures."
218,6,14,Kyle Broflovski,[limply] Can't... glue... any... more. [falls on his face again]
219,6,14,Stan Marsh,"The guards are coming, Kyle. Glue. Glue, damn you!"
220,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,Take this one away. He is done for. [a soldier drags a boys body along the floor]
221,6,14,Stan Marsh,Butters!
222,6,14,Butters Stotch,No more... arts and crafts...
223,6,14,Stan Marsh,"Jesus... we have to get out of here. [other kids are passed out, some on their backs, some on their stomachs]"
224,6,14,Girl 1,Please don't tell them that we're hiding here.
225,6,14,Girl 2,We can't work anymore. We'll die.
226,6,14,Camp Soldier,[walking by] Vhat? [closes the door and turns around] Waht?!
227,6,14,Eric Cartman,"Oh. Uh, nothing. I was just getting back to work."
228,6,14,Camp Soldier,Vhat is in there?
229,6,14,Eric Cartman,Nothing.
230,6,14,Camp Soldier,Get back to verk.
231,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[salutes] Yes sir! [the guard walks away] Phew. [opens the door and steps inside, laughing. A few moments later he craps and starts laughing]"
232,6,14,The Girls,Eww! Eww! Eww! [Cartman craps and laughs some more]
233,6,14,Eric Cartman,"[exits and alerts any available soldier] Hey, I was kidding. There's actually two girls hiding down there. Hey! [goes to find a soldier]"
234,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,Tonight we are here to honor an amazing fourth grade teacher with the Courageous Teacher award. [applause] Herbert Garrison came out about two years ago. Since then he has faced adversity. He has even faced ridicule by some of the students.
235,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"Oh Randy, I'm so ashamed of our son."
236,6,14,Museum of Tolerance Tour Guide,"It is my honor to present the Courageous Teacher award to... Herbert Garrison. [applause. She moves off as Garrison enters riding on Mr. Slave, humming a song. Mr. Garrison wears a towering headdress while Mr. Slave is dressed as a horse. Mr. Slave stops]"
237,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Get along, little Slave."
238,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,Oh my God.
239,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,That's what our boys were talking about?
240,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[rings some small bells] Ding-ding, ding-ding."
241,6,14,Man 1,[sitting next to Principal Victoria] He is so courageous.
242,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[now at the podium, with Mr. Slave standing to his right. He's wearing a purple belt with shiny purple dildo hanging from it] Say, Mr. Slave."
243,6,14,Mr Slave,"Yes, Mr. Garrison?"
244,6,14,Mr Garrison,I had a dream last night that you were a real dick.
245,6,14,Mr Slave,Really? Why would you dream that I was being an asshole?
246,6,14,Mr Garrison,"No no, I was the asshole. [a moment of silence, and more applause]"
247,6,14,Man 2,"[brown hair and mustache] Ogh, that is so courageous."
248,6,14,Man 3,[gray hair] What an amazing human being! [Randy and Gerald look at each other in shock]
249,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Uh, I uh I'm very happy to get this award. Uh but you know what makes me even happier? Sucking balls."
250,6,14,Audience,Ahh [applause]
251,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[frustrated, to Mr. Slave] It isn't working. Sing your song, Mr. Slave."
252,6,14,Mr Slave,"I've got a little- Oof. [grabs his stomach] Ohoc, Jesus Christ. What's happening in there?"
253,6,14,Frog King,"Hang on, Lemmiwinks! You solved the Catatafish's riddle. Now your trials are nearly through!"
254,6,14,Mr Slave,"Oh! I should have never shoved all those poor animals up my ass! [a few moments of thought, and then more applause]"
255,6,14,Mr Garrison,Uh...
256,6,14,Man 4,[black hair] Courageous.
257,6,14,Man 5,"[behind him, brown hair] So courageous."
258,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[frustrated and finally letting loose] God-damnit, don't you people get it?! I'm trying to get fired here! [the applause dies down]"
259,6,14,Man 3,"[softly] Oh, that's courageous."
260,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Look, this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher!"
261,6,14,Mr Slave,"Yeah, Jesus Christ."
262,6,14,Man 6,But the mu-se-um tells us to be to-le-rant
263,6,14,Man 3,[stands up and raises his arms] Yes. The mu-se-um.
264,6,14,Man 7,[stands up and raises his arms] The mu-se-um tells us.
265,6,14,Mr Garrison,"Tolerant, but not stupid! Look, just because you have to tolerate something doesn't mean you have to approve of it! If you had to like it, it'd be called the Museum of Acceptance! [the audience looks on] ""Tolerate"" means you're just putting up with it! You tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or, or you tolerate a bad cold. It can still piss you off! Jesus Tapdancing Christ!"
266,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"He's right. Our boys didn't hate homosexuals, they just hated the way this asshole was acting."
267,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,We'ge gotta get our boys back! [gets up and rushes out]
268,6,14,Mr Garrison,"[relieved] Ogh! Okay, so now can I PLEASE get fired and get my 25 million dollars?!"
269,6,14,Principal Victoria,"No, no, I think I have a better idea."
270,6,14,Sharon and Randy Marsh,"We're sorry, boys. Why didn't you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top?"
271,6,14,Gerald and Sheila Broflovski,Yes. You boys don't know how much we suffered. [a close-up of the boys shows that Butters is the thinnest of them]
272,6,14,Chris,"Come on, let's go. [the boys and their parents head away from the gate. As they go, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Slave are brought in by Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey. Two soldiers have them under gunpoint]"
273,6,14,Mr Garrison,But this is insane!
274,6,14,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry Mr. Garrison, but it's obvious you aren't tolerant of your own behavior."
275,6,14,Veritzen's Tolerance Camp Warden and soldiers,"[arrives] Vhat do we have here? Noo recruits? I assure you, the next veek will be nothing but pain and suffering! [pounds his right fist into his left palm]"
276,6,14,Mr Slave,"Oooo, this could be kind of fun. [convulses all of a sudden, goes down on hands and knees, and coughs up the gerbil]"
277,6,14,Singers (voiceover),"Lemmiwinks has made it out and his tale is nearly through
[the three spirits he met in Mr. Slave's body now appear before him]"
278,6,14,Catatafish,"Great job, Lemmiwinks."
279,6,14,Sparrow Prince,Thanks to you we are all free.
280,6,14,Frog King,"[draws close to Lemmiwinks] But your adventures are just beginning, for you are no ordinary gerbil, Lemmiwinks. You are the Gerbil King. [places a crown on its head, then backs up to join the other two animal spirits]"
281,6,14,The Three Spirits,All hail the Gerbil King. [they disappear]
