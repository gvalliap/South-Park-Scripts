0,19,7,Sgt Yates,Attention all units in the vicinity of South Park Elementary! [the officers pay attention] We have a code red! [units begin showing up] Principal calling for help during school assembly! All officers needed at once!
1,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"[in his patrol car eating a sub sandwich and drinking soda] The school? [puts down his food and starts the motor] Oh Jeez Louise! [turns his siren on and drives off. More units arrive at the school, even heavily-armed SWAT officers. They all arm themselves. Barbrady runs into one of the other cars]"
2,19,7,Sgt Yates,"[to the assembled officers] We need to get to the gym! Half go this way, half go around the side! Barbrady, you go around back! [the officers disperse. Barbrady goes into the school and finds empty hallways. He stops for a moment and one can hear him pant. He barges into the Fourth Grade classroom and finds it deserted. He goes through the school lobby and finds no one.]"
3,19,7,Officer 1,"On 3 1... 2... [Instead of getting to 3, the officers enter the gym with their weapons drawn. More cops enter from the other end.]"
4,19,7,PC Principal,"There she is, officers, right there. I told you to stop chatting with your friend, didn't I, Leslie? You [Leslie looks at him, bewildered] see, officers, apparently Leslie thinks that talking to her friends is more important than learning about diversity in third-world countries. [pulls out a laser pen light and lights Leslie up with it.] That one. That's her right there. You remove her from my school."
5,19,7,Officer Barbrady,[barges into the gym] Whoa! Nobody move! What's happening?
6,19,7,PC Principal,Get her out of here! [the light from his pointer falls upon Barbrady]
7,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Oh, they've got me! [reflexively fires a shot, which hits a boy on the right shoulder]"
8,19,7,1st Grade Boy,AAAAAH!
9,19,7,PC Principal,Waaaah!
10,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"This town is outraged, Officer Barbrady! People are tired of the police not being held accountable for their actions!"
11,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Mayor, I didn't know if there was a gunman, or a bomb-"
12,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,You shot an unarmed six year old Latino child!
13,19,7,Officer Barbrady,I'm sorry.
14,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,You're fired.
15,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"No, Mayor, please. This is all I know. I used to be the only policeman in this town, remember? Bob, ah I used to chase away the sixth graders for you."
16,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"You're from another time, Barbrady. And the last thing that needs to go. Your gun and your badge. [Barbrady takes them and lays them on the table] And your sunglasses."
17,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"[emotional] No, please, not my sunglasses."
18,19,7,Johnson,"You're done, Barbrady! The town doesn't want you here! [reluctantly, Brabrady takes off his sunglasses and lays them on the table.]"
19,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Where should I go?
20,19,7,Johnson,You should have thought of that before you shot a Mexican!
21,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,Latino-American.
22,19,7,Johnson,Latino-American. [blinks hard] Shit.
23,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,You should go away. You don't belong anywhere in a town as progressive as this one.
24,19,7,Homeless Man 1,"[sleeping upstairs at the abandoned Steed] Aaay, quiet down over there, I'm tryin' to sleep."
25,19,7,Stuart McCormick,[steps outside] Goddammit! You people all get out of here!
26,19,7,Homeless Man 2,"[sleeping upstairs at ""Bi the garage""] What makes you in charge? [Karen appears at the living room window]"
27,19,7,Stuart McCormick,'Cause this is my fuckin' house!
28,19,7,Homeless Man 3,"[kicks a trashcan and walks over to him] Hey beat it, man, or I'll make you my bitch! [Karen screams. Stuart gets Kenny back inside and Karen leaves the window.]"
29,19,7,Stuart McCormick,"Yeah, we've got a bunch of drunk-addict vagrants trespassing on our yard and we need assistance."
30,19,7,Sgt Yates,"[in his office] Oh, is that so? Well, we'd like to come help you, but we don't wanna get fired."
31,19,7,Stuart McCormick,What are you talkin' about? There's homeless people here and they're scarin' my kids! You need to come do somethin' about this!
32,19,7,Sgt Yates,I see. And are any of these homeless people of a minority persuasion?
33,19,7,Stuart McCormick,Why does that matter?
34,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Oh, it matters. See, it used be we could beat up minorities and nobody cared. It's the reason a lot of us joined the force. [lowers the phone a bit] Hey Mitch, you wanna go down and arrest some homeless people but not be able to beat up any minorities?"
35,19,7,Mitch Murphy,No thank you.
36,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Yeah, no, I think we're good. In fact, we're thinking of maybe turning the whole department into a hula school. Whattaya think?"
37,19,7,Stuart McCormick,God Dammit! [slams the phone down onto the base unit]
38,19,7,Mrs McCormick,What are they doing?
39,19,7,Stuart McCormick,They're not coming!
40,19,7,Mrs McCormick,"But they have to! Karen brought in one of their syringes, for Christ's sake!"
41,19,7,Stuart McCormick,"Well that's just too bad! The cops won't come, so there's nobody to scare the homeless away!"
42,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Hi, sweetheart. I've uh... I've been let go from the force. I'm so sorry.[an old dog raises its head and lets out a small groan. He walks over to it] Don't worry, old girl. [kneels down next to the dog and starts stroking it] It might be a little tough to afford your medication, but I'll find a way. You know me. I like to help. I like to be needed."
43,19,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys! Oh my God you guys! You guys, they're gay! [Butters catches up] They're totally gay!"
44,19,7,Stan Marsh,Who?
45,19,7,Eric Cartman,Kenny and Token.
46,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,What?
47,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Kenny and Token, dude. They're so gay. Butters told me."
48,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,You're lying.
49,19,7,Eric Cartman,"No dude. In those old abandoned buildings around Kenny's house, Kenny and Token turned it into a big ninja clubhouse. And they dress and play ninjas in it trying to scare people away."
50,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,How is that gay?
51,19,7,Eric Cartman,"It's the gayest thing ever dude? Ninjas are fuckin' dumb! Dude, come one! We've gotta go see this!"
52,19,7,Butters Stotch,Over this way! [they all go have a look]
53,19,7,Token Black,"We will defend our ninja honor! [spotting something over a crossbow] Intruders! Protect the base! [the four boys come into view] Hey guys, did you come to see our ninja fortress?"
54,19,7,Eric Cartman,[in hushed tones] Oh my God they're so gay you guys.
55,19,7,Stan Marsh,You and Kenny built all this?
56,19,7,Token Black,"Yeah, with Clyde and David too. [Clyde swings into view while David climbs up a rope.]"
57,19,7,Clyde Donavon,You guys should come and check it out.
58,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Ah, no, we're good, thanks. [in hushed tones] Oh my God this is a sausage party!"
59,19,7,Clyde Donavon,"It's pretty cool, dude. People are scared of us."
60,19,7,Eric Cartman,"[sarcastically] Yeah, I'm sure they are. [a big truck stops in its tracks.]"
61,19,7,Driver and Passenger,"Hey, excuse me, man, do you know where-? [Arabic music plays and the ninjas began showing off their moves.] AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAH! Look! AAAAH!"
62,19,7,Driver and Passenger,"Go, go, go! [the truck takes off. The four boys look on in wonder, Cartman walks into the street. The truck reaches the end of the block and hangs a left, and disappears]"
63,19,7,Eric Cartman,That's pretty cool.
64,19,7,Gerald Broflovski,Well the way I heard it was that the girl in the school wasn't even doing anything. Just talking too loud. And someone ends up getting shot.
65,19,7,Skeeter,Hey! What you want?
66,19,7,Officer Barkley,"It's okay, I'm off duty. Just came in for a nice pinot."
67,19,7,Bar Patron,"Yeah? Well go somewhere else, copper! CtPaTown is for people who care about each other!"
68,19,7,Skeeter,We don't take kindly to folks who impose their authority on the underprivileged!
69,19,7,Officer Barkley,"Now look, not all cops are racist trigger-happy assholes."
70,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Really? I'll bet you don't even know what ""farm to table"" means. [Barkley stands there a moment and then walks out, letting the door slam shut. Bar patrons cheer and holler at their success]"
71,19,7,Randy Marsh,[steps forward] Wow. We've only had a Whole Foods for a month and already we don't need cops. So cool. [smiles]
72,19,7,Token Black,"It is a great honor to see that you all want to be ninjas. Joining our club is very serious. You must promise to uphold the warrior's code. [Butters and Cartman, Stan and Kyle are now dressed as ninjas]"
73,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Totally dude, ninjas are sweet."
74,19,7,Token Black,"Together we must strive to make our fortress super bad-ass and keep all intruders out! To that end, let us proceed to our training."
75,19,7,Eric Cartman,"[catches up to a ninja] Dude, can I talk to you for a minute? Listen, I don't think we should let Kyle be a ninja, okay? He said ninjas were gay. He's probably gonna try and turn it around on me, but that's 'cause Kyle knows I heard him."
76,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,You're talking to Kyle right now.
77,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, cool... it's me, Butters."
78,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,You're the one who said ninjas were gay. Why do you wanna make this a problem?
79,19,7,Eric Cartman,"I'm just, I'm just Butters, man. I have problems with lots of things."
80,19,7,Butters Stotch,"Hey Eric, you wanna try sparring with me?"
81,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Yes I do, Butters. [kicks him in the nuts and walks away]"
82,19,7,Butters Stotch,OOF. Ow. Ahem.
83,19,7,Clyde Donavon,Intruders! [two homeless men approach the fortress with filled grocery bags]
84,19,7,Homeless Man 4,"Yeah, it's right up here. We can shoot up in these abandoned buildings. [the ninjas, eight in all, appear before them and make a show of force. The men begin to confuse them for ISIS, drop their bags, and run away]"
85,19,7,News Anchor and Reporter,The town of South Park is holding a large protest tonight outside of their police department. The townspeople say the protest is meant to begin a dialog about the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect.
86,19,7,News Anchor and Reporter,Are your children being lured into terrorist organizations? A shocking report shows that some kids in the town of South Park are swearing loyalty to a murderous regime.
87,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, we're pretty bad-ass, and um, this is, like, our fortress, and you can see it's really cool."
88,19,7,News Anchor and Reporter,And what about this way of life has attracted you?
89,19,7,Butters Stotch,"We're just cool 'cause we're tough, and we fight and stuff, and we can ah-."
90,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Yeah yeah yeah, and it's like, we can do whatever we want, and people are scared of us, it's totally rad!"
91,19,7,Stan Marsh,Then why'd you say it was gay before?
92,19,7,Eric Cartman,Oh my God! I never said it was gay!
93,19,7,Token Black,"Wait, he said this was gay?"
94,19,7,Eric Cartman,"That is a total lie!! Why would I say anything homophobic about the way Tweek and Craig make love?! [points to Stan] He's a lying, backstabbing Jew!"
95,19,7,Stan Marsh,I'm Stan.
96,19,7,News Anchor and Reporter,No doubt the growing number of kids swearing loyalty to ISIS could be problematic for the progressive town.
97,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"[to his dog] Here you go, old girl. We'll just have to make do. [Randy exits the store with some groceries, but fails to notice Barbrady nearby]"
98,19,7,Randy Marsh,Ew. [keeps walking]
99,19,7,Homeless Man 5,Spare a dollar?
100,19,7,Randy Marsh,"No I don't I'm sorry thank you Goddammit ew. [the Mayor and her aides survey the situation by Skeeter's Bar. Randy sees her and approaches] Mayor, I didn't bust my ass to gentrify this part of town to have it overrun with homeless people!"
101,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,Why are they all suddenly coming here?
102,19,7,Gerald Broflovski,"[arrives with Sheila] Mayor, what are you going to do about this? My wife and I can barely eat or shop."
103,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,When a town like ours has a homeless problem it must look at the root of what's causing it.
104,19,7,Stephen Stotch,[arrives with Linda] It's ISIS!
105,19,7,Randy Marsh,What?
106,19,7,Stephen Stotch,"They're these troubled kids who've turned their backs on America! They've taken over SoDoSoPa, forced all the homeless out!"
107,19,7,Gerald Broflovski,Why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that?
108,19,7,Stephen Stotch,They're just bad kids! Rotten on the inside! Probably with shitty parents!
109,19,7,Ryan Valmer,"Son, I've always tried to be a fair dad. Eh I I don't want to meh make you angry, but... why?"
110,19,7,Jimmy Valmer,"Well Dad, I just re-really like being a part of something. I feel like it's character-building and it's lots of fun."
111,19,7,Ryan Valmer,Fun? But what do you... believe in?
112,19,7,Jimmy Valmer,"What do we believe in? We believe in something greater than ourselves, and that by following our strict warrior code we believe that our faiths and our traditions are a way to a greater path - the p-p-p-path of the warrior. And as long as we stay united in honor we can defeat all our enemies. [this is beginning to freak Ryan out, so he screams and leaves the table as fast as he can.] Wow, the fellas were right. People are really freaked out by ninjas."
113,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Okay, we've just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didn't mean it, okay?"
114,19,7,Gerald Broflovski,"Jeez, this is so embarrassing."
115,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,What if they won't help us with the homeless?
116,19,7,Stephen Stotch,I'm pretty sure the police will help out if it's because ISIS is taking over the town. [opens the double doors and leads the council in]
117,19,7,Stephen Stotch,"Officers, there's kids in town who have joined ISIS. We don't know who they are, but they-."
118,19,7,Sgt Yates,"What? What's that, you say?"
119,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"The town is in danger, alright? We don't know what these kids are capable of."
120,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Jeez, I'm sorry. We've got to work on our koholo kaloa, and get the lomi lomi chicken ready for the big ho'olao le'ao, which leaves us... oh, not enough time to deal with ISIS."
121,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Alright, look. There's homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district. If you don't stop thewe twisted kids, then-"
122,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Hey, who was it that said ""fuck the police""? Was that Ice Cube? Tupac? Oh, right, that was you guys! Sorry, but I guess you'll have to find somebody else to do all the difficult dirty shit you don't want to do yourselves. I've gotta be ready for the luau. I might even kiss a dude."
123,19,7,Eric Cartman,"So then, after you told me, we went over to Kyle and Stan when they were playing basketball, remember?"
124,19,7,Butters Stotch,Yeah?
125,19,7,Eric Cartman,"And we said Kenny and Token were playing ninjas, and Kyle said that ninjas were gay, and I said ninjas are gay, but it was a question. You remember?"
126,19,7,Butters Stotch,Uh I thought you said it first.
127,19,7,Eric Cartman,"No nonono, see? Now Kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesn't wanna get kicked out of the group. That's what Jews do when they get caught in a lie. You cannot trust a Jewish ninja, Butters."
128,19,7,Token Black,You guys! You guys!
129,19,7,Stan Marsh,What?
130,19,7,Token Black,Actual Ninjas. Wanna talk to us.
131,19,7,Clyde Donavon,What?
132,19,7,Token Black,Kenny and I both just got the same email from people overseas.
133,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Whoa, dude."
134,19,7,Stan Marsh,How's they found out who we were?
135,19,7,Eric Cartman,"They're fuckin' ninjas, dude!"
136,19,7,ISIS Leader,"So, you are the brave children who have committed to our cause. We are aware of what you are doing and we are very impressed."
137,19,7,Stan Marsh,"Cool. Thanks, dude."
138,19,7,ISIS Leader,What you are doing is very important and we would like to help you however we can. We are going to be wiring you some money.
139,19,7,Butters Stotch,"Whoa, cool! Why, this is the greatest thing ever you guys!"
140,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Ah, excuse me. Can I just set the record straight on something?"
141,19,7,ISIS Leader,Of course.
142,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Should Jews be trusted? [no response. A few seconds later...] Uh I mean, if one of us is a Jew, do you see that as being at all problematic?"
143,19,7,ISIS Leader,Extremely.
144,19,7,Eric Cartman,"YES! [dances away] YEEES! [""Can't Touch This"" begins to play and Cartman does arm waves.] Oh—oh, oh—oh! Oh—oh, oh—oh! What did I tell you guys?"
145,19,7,Randy Marsh,[his shadow falls upon ex-Officer Barbrady] Hey Barbrady. [tries to wake him up] Officer Barbrady.
146,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Uh, who?"
147,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Hey buddy. [flanking him are the Mayor and her aides, and the Stotches]"
148,19,7,Officer Barbrady,What do you want?
149,19,7,Johnson,How would you like to be a policeman again?
150,19,7,Officer Barbrady,I'm no good as a policeman. I'm a bumbling old fool.
151,19,7,Stephen Stotch,"That is not true! Who said that? Look, Barbrady, the fact is, the town needs you."
152,19,7,Officer Barbrady,They need me? To do what?
153,19,7,Randy Marsh,We need you to shoot some kids. [smiles]
154,19,7,Officer Barbrady,No! Shoot kids? I don't wanna shoot kids!
155,19,7,Randy Marsh,Shh! Shhh! Shhhh! These are really bad kids. Terrorists. This is totally different from before.
156,19,7,Officer Barbrady,No. No. Are any of them minorities?
157,19,7,Aide,"A couple of them, we think. Yeah."
158,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Noo no no no no no no no no!
159,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"Sh, look, look look, Barbrady, Barbrady! We were wrong about you. I... was wrong about you. You... protected this town back before anybody else ever did. You used to do it all on your own. We need you to do that again. [takes out his sunglasses from her inside coat pocket and hands them to him. He puts them on and his sadness disappears]"
160,19,7,Randy Marsh,"You're the only cop this town needs, Barbrady. Go shoot those kids."
161,19,7,Eric Cartman,"You guys, I know this is hard for all of us. But to truly be ninjas, we must face hard facts. Last night I spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas. We talked a long time about Jews and the Hebrew faith. He told me a lot I didn't know. And I was able to tell him some things he did not know. But after talking with that guy, it is abundantly clear to me that Jews cannot be ninjas. I went to Kyle's house to talk to him about it, and I found this. [pulls out a drawing of two ninjas, one of them having anal sex with the other one] It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization. And he almost got away with it. That's when Kyle tried to kill me. Luckily I was the faster ninja. [reveals the, uh, guilty ninja, who's strapped into a chair and his ninja head covering is duck-taped over his face] Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay. When I take the gag off, he's going to try and tell you that I'm lying now. Do not believe him. Kyle is a liar."
162,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,I'm right here. [standing between Token and Stan]
163,19,7,Eric Cartman,"[looks at the group, then at the bound ninja] Who, who is this?"
164,19,7,Stan Marsh,That's Clyde.
165,19,7,Eric Cartman,"...and I am Token. Why do I do these things, you ask? Black rage."
166,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"Oh Jesus. ISIS, oh God."
167,19,7,Marvin Marsh,This chicken tastes like shit. What'd you do to it?
168,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Okay, okay Dad, it's not organic chicken. I'm not comfortable shopping at Whole Foods with all the homeless people there. But don't worry. That's all about to change. Soon we'll all have CtPaTown to enjoy again. Where's Stan?"
169,19,7,Sharon Marsh,He's playing ninjas over at Kenny's house.
170,19,7,Randy Marsh,Ninjas? That's gay. [remembers the ISIS warriors who took over SoDoSoPa] He's playing ninjas at Kenny's house?
171,19,7,Sharon Marsh,Yeah.
172,19,7,Randy Marsh,"You mean, SoDoSoPa?"
173,19,7,Sharon Marsh,Uh huh.
174,19,7,Randy Marsh,[begins to think this over] Wait a minute... Ninjas... [Oriental and Arabic music alternate in his head] ...scary... gay... Scary. Gay. Scary gay scary gay.
175,19,7,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, what are you doing?"
176,19,7,Randy Marsh,Scary gay scary gay scary GAY. [runs out of the dining room] Staaaan!! [Shelly looks back at him]
177,19,7,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I get the misunderstanding now. No, see, I told Clyde that Kyle said ninjas were gay, but Clyde thought I was Kyle, so then he was saying that I said ninjas were gay, meaning I as in Kyle."
178,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,"Nobody ever gave a shit, you fat pig!"
179,19,7,Token Black,All those in favor of Cartman being kicked out of our ninja club?
180,19,7,Ninjas,Hai!
181,19,7,Eric Cartman,"No! You CAN'T kick me out! I have to be a ninja! They hate Jews. I was made for this, you guys! Please!"
182,19,7,Stan Marsh,What shall we do with him? [Barbrady climbs over a wall and quickly reaches the ninjas]
183,19,7,Officer Barbrady,[draws his gun] Freeze! [the ninjas turn around]
184,19,7,Kyle Broflovski,Oh shit!
185,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"[trembling in fear] Please, I don't wanna shoot you. [the ninjas back away]"
186,19,7,Stan Marsh,Cool. Don't.
187,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Oh ho ho. [groans miserably and waves gun]
188,19,7,Ninjas,Aaahaah. [Cartman shuts his eyes and faces left]
189,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"I understand you feeling angry at this town. I'm getting pretty angry too. But we can't give up on it. Please boys, don't make it end violently."
190,19,7,Randy Marsh,"[finds the ninjas and Barbrady] They're just stupid ninjas! [tackles Barbrady, who instinctively fires off a shot. David is struck.]"
191,19,7,David Rodriguez,Aaa!
192,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Aaahaahaaawe!
193,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,What were you thinking?! Boys innocently playing ninja and you pull your gun on them?
194,19,7,Aide,David Rodriguez was lucky to live!
195,19,7,Officer Barbrady,Everybody told me they were terrorists.
196,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"We thought they were. But if it turns out they aren't, as a policeman, you have to figure that out!"
197,19,7,Officer Barbrady,"But, you said you needed me to kill some kids."
198,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Oh, he's gonna lay this on us now. I said kill some kids, but I said it as a question, remember? I said ""Kill some kids?"""
199,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,"I'm sorry, but we just can't cover your ass on this one. There's going to be an investigation and ... you just don't have what it takes to be a policeman in today's times."
200,19,7,Johnson,"Do you even know what ""farm to table"" means? [Barbrady takes off his glasses and lays them on the table.]"
201,19,7,Officer Barkley,"Let's go people, you can't stay here. You are being relocated."
202,19,7,Homeless Man 6,"Hey, you can't kick us out of here, man."
203,19,7,Sgt Yates,Oh no? I'm a cop.
204,19,7,Randy Marsh,"Thank you, officers."
205,19,7,Sgt Yates,"We've got a deal, right?"
206,19,7,Mayor McDaniels,Yes. [she and Randy turn away and XXX*what do they do*XXX]
207,19,7,Sgt Yates,"Alright you, come on! [punches the homeless man in the face. Other officers take time to abuse the homeless people a little. One officer kicks a homeless man in the balls twice while another officer holds him, then the two officers take him away. A street sweeper rolls by collecting all the homeless who are still sleeping on the street, and even a few who are walking around]"
208,19,7,Homeless Man 6,Aaaah!
209,19,7,Homeless Man 7,[being led away by an officer] Please! You can't take me back to SoDoSoPa! ISIS is there!
