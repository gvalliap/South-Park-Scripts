0,19,9,Mrs Nelson,"Alright guys, now let's go back and talk about infinitives [begins writing the lesson on that subject]. Remember, those are verbs combined with the work ""to."""
1,19,9,Eric Cartman,"[yawns and whispers to Kyle] Oh, my fucking God..."
2,19,9,Mrs Nelson,"Now, usually an infinitive acts like a noun, as in ""I want TO go out to eat"" or [Cartman tugs on Kyle's pen, making him mess up, and smiles. Kyle pulls the pen away. Cartman pulls again] ""I hope TO be chosen today."""
3,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?
4,19,9,Eric Cartman,"I'm so bored, dude."
5,19,9,Mrs Nelson,"Now usually, it isn't common to split TO and the verb, but sometimes you can, [Cartman pulls the pen out of Kyle's hand and throws it away],"
6,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Knock it off!
7,19,9,Mrs Nelson,"as in-. Is there a problem, guys?"
8,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Go get my pen, fatass"
9,19,9,Eric Cartman,"I am not your slave, Kyle."
10,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Go get my pen!
11,19,9,Mr Mackey,"[over the PA system] Attention, students. Kyle Broflovski report to the Principal's office please?"
12,19,9,Eric Cartman,"[laughs] PC Principal wants to see you, Kyle!"
13,19,9,Mr Mackey,"Kyle Broflovski to the Principal's office please, m'kay?"
14,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Goddammit! [leaves his seat]
15,19,9,Eric Cartman,"Have fun, dude."
16,19,9,Mr Mackey,"[looks up surprised] Oh, Kyle. [sits down on the chair and looks fearful] Uhh, uhh, thank you for coming."
17,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Where's PC Principal?
18,19,9,Mr Mackey,"I think he's finally lost it, Kyle. He and his PC buddies are on a hunger strike and, they're calling for people's resignations. Kyle, PC Principal had problems with Jimmy and with Leslie. And now they're missing. M'kay? Nobody knows where they are. That's what happens. You go against PC, and you just end up missing. M'kay?"
19,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,What are you talking about?
20,19,9,Mr Mackey,"PC Principal had issues with them. M'kay? And he had issues with you, Kyle. Whatever's goin' on, it's pretty damn scary."
21,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"For years, mankind has tried to rid the world of ads. For our ancestors, ads couldn't be avoided. But everyone knew what was an ad, and what wasn't. After many years, mankind invented cable. A way to p-pay for television so there would be no ads. But somehow, the ads still found a way. And so mankind invented Tivo. A way to skip past commercials. Finally, it appeared to be the end of ads. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads were stopped. Or so it seemed. With the rise of the Internet, suddenly the ads got an en- tirely new way to attack us. Popups. The top scientific minds were brought together to find a way to stop the ads, once and for all. They invented the ad blocker. Suddenly there were no ads on phones, on computers. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads adapted. They became s-smarter. They disguised themselves as news. All around the world people read news stories completely unaware that they were reading ads	. And now, the ads have taken the next step in their evolution. They have taken human form. Ads are among us. They could be your friend, your g-gardener. The ads are trying to wipe us out. But the question is... how?"
22,19,9,Randy Marsh,"So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now. You guys wanna bail? [everyone else but Grandpa are stunned at this and stop eating.]"
23,19,9,Sharon Marsh,What?
24,19,9,Shelly Marsh,What are you talking about?
25,19,9,Randy Marsh,"It's just, you know, it used to be nice and laid-back here, but now it's all [puts his palms forward] Uuuuhhh, you know? Like like now everybody's all Uuhh-uuhhh. Let's bail. You wanna bail, Stan?"
26,19,9,Stan Marsh,"No, I don't. [Randy lowers his head and looks at his food,]"
27,19,9,Sharon Marsh,"What's going on, Randy?"
28,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Nothing! I just... You know, we don't have to live here, we can live anywhere."
29,19,9,Sharon Marsh,"Last month, all you could talk about was how great this town had become. What changed your mind?"
30,19,9,Randy Marsh,[stops and looks away] ...We can't afford it. [Sharon's jaw drops]
31,19,9,Sharon Marsh,We can't afford it?
32,19,9,Randy Marsh,"All these fancy new restaurants and shops and [sits on the edge of the bed] everyone wants to live here! A bowl of City beef costs ten bucks now, for Christ's sake. And there's nowhere to shop but stupid Whole Foods!"
33,19,9,Sharon Marsh,"[crosses her arms] Well, we'll just have to stop going to those places."
34,19,9,Randy Marsh,I had to take out a second mortgage on the house.
35,19,9,Sharon Marsh,You [uncrosses her arms] what?
36,19,9,Randy Marsh,"[gets up, runs to her, and holds her shoulders] I had to, Sharon! It isn't my fault! It's the Man. Don't you see? The Man... is pricing us out of our own town."
37,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"[faces the newsmen] It's just my luck. I talk to a nice girl, seem to hit it off, and she turns out to just be an ad."
38,19,9,Tom,"Well, that's what an ad does. She was designed to entice, and manipulate."
39,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,This is such a fantastic story for the school newspaper. Why don't we just run it so that everyone knows the truth?
40,19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, we're newsmen, like you. For decades we used our soft buttery voices to inform the people about what's happening. Then we watched as our entire industry was taken over by the ads. [the newsman to his right lowers his head and looks at the table] Some of our colleagues were manipulated into doing the ads' bidding. The man who came to your house with a gun was one of them. Our own Kevin Jarvis has more."
41,19,9,Kevin,"Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the man who tried to kill you was Brian Boint, of WXNR, Fort Collins. When he saw there was no money in news anymore he sided with the ads, even though he knew it meant the destruction of our species. Back to you, Tom."
42,19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Kevin. The only hope for the truth to get out there, Jimmy, is for you to see through this ad's deception and to find out what they're planning. Your Super School News was a threat to them. But unless you get this little bitch to talk, we may never know why.
[South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Kenny and Stan walk into view, spot Kyle, and walk over to him. Stan is carrying a copy of the school newspaper]"
43,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Dude, Kyle. Will you look at this? [shows him the paper, which has a report on PC Principal sending Jimmy and Leslie on a Disney Cruise]"
44,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"""Principal Sends Two Favorite Students On A Disney Cruise. This week, students Jimmy Valmer and Leslie Meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-"" what the hell is this?"
45,19,9,Stan Marsh,"It doesn't make any sense, dude. PC Principal is using the school paper to cover something up."
46,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah I... Ah I don't wanna get involved.
47,19,9,Stan Marsh,"You don't wanna get involved? Dude, what's wrong with you?"
48,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,I've already learned you can't win against PC Principal. You should know of all people since he converted your dad.
49,19,9,Stan Marsh,What's that supposed to mean?
50,19,9,Butters Stotch,[runs up with Cartman] Fellas! We found out what happened to Jimmy! He got to go on a vacation for being an exemplary student.
51,19,9,Stan Marsh,That is not what happened! Something is very wrong here! We all have to stand up to PC Principal together!
52,19,9,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, and wasn't Jimmy the one in charge of the school newspaper? So who's putting this out?"
53,19,9,Nathan,"I like the school paper. I like to type with my hands. [the camera then shows Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters in the room watching Nathan.]"
54,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Who told you that the principal sent Jimmy on a Disney Cruise?
55,19,9,Nathan,"Uhhh. Uhhh. Uhhh, I don't remember."
56,19,9,Stan Marsh,You have quotes in here from Jimmy. Did you talk to him?
57,19,9,Nathan,"Uhhh. Uhhh, I like the school paper."
58,19,9,Stan Marsh,"[the boys look at each other] Come on, we'll get to the bottom of this. [they head out]"
59,19,9,Nathan,"[some seconds later] Did I do good, computer? [touches the screen] I think the sponsored content fooled them. I hope I made you happy. Can you see me, computer? Do you know what I'm thinking right now? [a porn popup windows appears] Ahh, thanks, computer."
60,19,9,Principal Victoria,"We have to make sure nobody recognizes us. There's no telling who works for who. Here, Caitlyn, I got you this fake mustache to put on."
61,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"I'm not putting on a mustache, I'll look silly."
62,19,9,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that, that's where you draw the line, huh Caitlyn?"
63,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,Don't be an asshole.
64,19,9,Mr Garrison,"No, you're right, that's nuts! A woman wearing a mustache, that's just ridiculous, huh Cait?"
65,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"Alright alright, I'll put it on, fuck."
66,19,9,Mr Garrison,"No no, please, Cait, don't put on a fake mustache, that's c-razy. [Caitlyn puts it on] You don't want people thinking you're a weirdo, I mean, Jeez."
67,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,[taps him gently like a kitten] You-hur such an asshole.
68,19,9,Mr Garrison,What the hell is this? What have they done to my town?
69,19,9,Principal Victoria,Keep your voice down.
70,19,9,Mr Garrison,Since when do we have a flippin' Whole Foods?! [they walk towards it]
71,19,9,Principal Victoria,Everything's changed.
72,19,9,Survey worker,"[stops the three of them] Hi there, you got a minute for gay rights?"
73,19,9,Mr Garrison,"Gay rights? Jeez, you've already got all those. What the hell do you wanna do now? [the three walk on in]"
74,19,9,Clerk,"All right, your total is a hundred twenty six thirty nine, and would you like to give a dollar to help hungry children get iPads to protect your Internet safe space today?"
75,19,9,Stephen Stotch,I will.
76,19,9,Mr Garrison,What the Sam Hell is goin' on!
77,19,9,Leslie,Why would anyone think that I'm on the principal's side? I hate the principal. I think he's a dick.
78,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,So you don't know anything about the principal that might be newsworthy? Super School News worthy?
79,19,9,Leslie,Just that he hated me and called me a blabbermouth. I don't think I'm a blabbermouth. I just like talking to people.
80,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"[clears his throat] Leslie, what kind of... plans do you have? Do you have any... plans?"
81,19,9,Leslie,What kind of plans?
82,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Just, you know, plans. Like what are you hoping tooo... accomplish? [the newsmen watch from the meeting room]"
83,19,9,Leslie,I don't know. What are your plans?
84,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Well, I want to pursue careers in both news reporting and comedy."
85,19,9,Leslie,Really? That's... different.
86,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah, you're pretty different yourself, Leslie."
87,19,9,Leslie,How so?
88,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,I'm starting to think that maybe all ads aren't so bad.
89,19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, you're thinking with your dick."
90,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,I am not thinking with my dick.
91,19,9,Tom,Yes you are.
92,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"No, I just think that she's a-"
93,19,9,Tom,Put your dick away.
94,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,She's ag- emotional
95,19,9,Tom,Jim.
96,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Interesting, caring girl."
97,19,9,Tom,"Jimmy, that's your dick talking. [Jimmy stays quiet] Believe me, I know how you feel. Ads promise us things. Ads are perfect. But make no mistake: [speaks slowly] all ads lie. And all ads deceive."
98,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,There. Leslie's Instagram and her Twitter. Last entry was ten days ago.
99,19,9,Butters Stotch,What about Jimmy's?
100,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Jimmy never used that stuff, remember? He said he hated using the Internet."
101,19,9,Eric Cartman,How do you hate the Internet? That's like hating titties.
102,19,9,Butters Stotch,What are you doing now?
103,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm just looking for any news articles or anything about PC Principal. [his computer is recording the conversation] Where did you say PC Principal was from?
104,19,9,Stan Marsh,I think it was Vermont.
105,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Maybe there's something from the news in Vermont that could give us a clue about- [an ad for a Vermont vacation pops up] Goddammit what the hell is this?
106,19,9,Stan Marsh,That's an ad for skiing in Vermont.
107,19,9,Butters Stotch,"Wow that looks fun! [Kyle closes the popup and tries again. A couple of windows later, he gets a news article]"
108,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude. Dude, look at this. ""How PC Culture is changing Vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-"" [a popup ad for a guitar appears] Dude there it is again!"
109,19,9,Kenny McCormick,What?
110,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's that goddamned guitar! This ad is fucking following me!
111,19,9,Stan Marsh,Just click out of it.
112,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,I'm trying! Goddammit get over here!
113,19,9,Stan Marsh,That's a pretty sweet-looking guitar.
114,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks at Stan] It is pretty cool dude, it tunes itself."
115,19,9,Eric Cartman,How does it do that?
116,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It's this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments. See look, I'll show you.
Stan:	Oh that's sweet. Send me the link to that so I can- [a popup ad for Victor Frankenstein appears] Oh dude that new Frankenstein movie is out. I totally wanna see that."
117,19,9,Eric Cartman,That movie's gonna suck dude.
118,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Hit the arrow, I wanna see where it's playing."
119,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"[click] OH. Sorry, wrong arrow button. [a popup ad for Fun Cream ice cream appears]"
120,19,9,Butters Stotch,"Wow, what kind of ice cream is that?"
121,19,9,Butters Stotch,"So Clyde said to Token, ""Why don't you open a bank account with your mouth so I can deposit my dick in it?"" [the boys laugh]"
122,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,So then what'd Token say?
123,19,9,Butters Stotch,Well Token was all like-
124,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Wait wait wait wait wait whoa, whoa. What the hell are we doing?"
125,19,9,Eric Cartman,"Eating ice cream, dipshit."
126,19,9,Stan Marsh,But what about Jimmy? We were all like totally trying to find out what happened to him.
127,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, what the hell just happened?"
128,19,9,Butters Stotch,"We got distracted. We've gotta get back to that computer! [The boys split for the computer without their ice cream, except to Cartman, who takes his... and a couple of seconds later, Kenny's]"
129,19,9,Skeeter,Now this here is a dry Riesling. You're gonna experience vanilla after-tones and a nutty finish.
130,19,9,Rancher,You mean like someone put their balls in the glass?
131,19,9,Skeeter,"No, like chestnuts, dammit!"
132,19,9,Rancher,I just can't keep up with this town no more. Everything's gettin' all nice and fancy. I swear I'm gonna need to get a second mortgage on the ranch just to pay muh daily expenses.
133,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Don't you get it? That's just what they want. Nobody cares about the people who lived here before. They want us to move, 'cause they wanna knock our houses down and build more lofts and villas!"
134,19,9,Skeeter,"Alright Randy, you should probably lay off the old vine Châteauneuf-du-Pape."
135,19,9,Randy Marsh,[now by Stuart's table] You'll all see! Pretty soon everyone who used to live here is gonna have to move. And we'll be shopping at Safeway again. [sets his glass down on the table and walks out the door]
136,19,9,Randy singing,Where has my town gone? Where has- [a leg kicks him across the face]
137,19,9,Randy Marsh,Oooff!
138,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"You like apples? [punches him in the belly, causing him to groan] How d'you like them apples? [hauls him into the alley]"
139,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Hey, it's Caitlyn Jenner! [Caitlyn slams Randy against a wall face first]"
140,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Check his ass!
141,19,9,Randy Marsh,Principal Victoria? [Caitlyn pulls down Randy's pants and briefs to reveal the PC branding]
142,19,9,Principal Victoria,He's one of them.
143,19,9,Randy Marsh,One of what?
144,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Caitlyn. [Caitlyn punches Randy hard in the ribs. He groans and collapses onto the ground.]
145,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Okay Leslie, let's try a different approach. Let's say you wanted tooo... destroy the entire species. How would you go about it?"
146,19,9,Leslie,"Why would I want to destroy an entire species? You have the wrong idea about me, Jimmy. The person trying to change things and make things terrible is the new principal."
147,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"And what is the new principal trying to do, Leslie?"
148,19,9,Leslie,"He's trying to make sure that people like you and me aren't allowed to exist. I know that you're trying to help. I know that the newsmen in there are trying to help too. [Kevin glances back at Tom] But now I'm going to tell you something very important, Jimmy. [the newsmen lean in towards the monitors. A popup car ad appears, and they can't see or hear what Leslie is saying.]"
149,19,9,The Chevy Ad,"[a driver walks up to his truck and plays with his dog]
Like a rock. I drive a Chevy, I'm a cowboy, and I drive it like a rock."
150,19,9,,What the hell is that?
151,19,9,Kevin,"Tom, it looks like a popup ad."
152,19,9,Tom,How did an ad get in here? Let's go to David at the network hub.
153,19,9,David,"No answers here, Tom. We're trying to correct the problem."
154,19,9,Leslie,"You have to get me out of here, Jimmy. They're going to kill me."
155,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,What?
156,19,9,Leslie,"Listen to me carefully and don't look at the glass. I feel something for you I have never felt before. I think it's trust. The men in there are sick with hatred and as soon as they realize I have no information they are going to burn me. I've seen them do it to others. Please, you have to help me, Jimmy. Don't let them hurt me. Please don't abandon me. When the lights go back on just look at me and smile."
157,19,9,Tom,"David, any word on the popup ad situation?"
158,19,9,David,"Tom, we've just about got it fixed. It should be ready now. [the newsmen turn to look at the monitors, and Leslie is down]"
159,19,9,Leslie,"And that's really it, Jimmy. I want to help all of you however I can. [he looks at her, and smiles a second later]"
160,19,9,Eric Cartman,"And then Token tells Clyde that if his mouth was a bank, Clyde's mom would have already deposited her dick in it. Which is hilarious because Clyde's mom is dead. [the boys burst out laughing again]"
161,19,9,Stan Marsh,Wait wait wait wait whoa whoa. What the hell are we doing?
162,19,9,Butters Stotch,"We're tryin' on shoes and eatin' chicken nuggets, stupid. What do you think?"
163,19,9,Stan Marsh,No. That's not what we set out to do.
164,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,We were... We were on Cartman's computer looking up news stories about PC Principal.
165,19,9,Eric Cartman,Didn't we finish doing that?
166,19,9,Stan Marsh,"No, we didn't."
167,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,It's like... someone's trying to... distract us. [looks suspiciously at Stan] Because they're worried what we'll uncover about PC people.
168,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because they're afraid."
169,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Why are you looking at me?
170,19,9,Stan Marsh,Why are you looking at me?
171,19,9,Eric Cartman,Why isn't anyone looking at me?
172,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Hey, fuck you."
173,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Wake up, dickhead!"
174,19,9,Randy Marsh,[opens his eyes] Garrison? The hell is wrong with you?!
175,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"I'll tell you what's wrong with me! There's enemies to humanity out there wantin' to put an end to all of us, and there's assholes like you helpin' them out!"
176,19,9,Randy Marsh,I don't know what you're talking about.
177,19,9,Principal Victoria,Whose idea was it to revitalize the shitty part of town into an arts and foods district called ShiTpaTown?
178,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Son of a bitch!
179,19,9,Randy Marsh,What? To take one area of town that was rappy and gentrify it for the local people to enjoy? I thought we could keep it contained.
180,19,9,Principal Victoria,"It doesn't contain. What's happened to South Park is happening everywhere. [brings out a photo book and flips through some pictures] Thirty miles south of here in the town of Fairplay, they've changed the area north od Downtown into NoDoFoPa. A rundown area south of the capital in Cheyenne, Wyoming, is now historic SoCaCheyWo. Channel Street in mid-Chicago is being revitalized into Chimichanga."
181,19,9,Randy Marsh,Oh my God.
182,19,9,Principal Victoria,"LoDo, SoBro, RivMo, all happening at the same time. And it isn't just in the U.S. In Cairo, the area northwest of the third pyramid is NoWe3Pi. Three miles north of Auschwitz is NoMoAuchie. It goes on and on!"
183,19,9,Randy Marsh,What does it mean?
184,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"In our town it all started when PC Principal arrived. He's part of a mjuch larger conspiracy, and you're his lackey."
185,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Not me. If PC Principal has been using us, I'll take the bastard down myself.
[The PC Delta house, day. A reporter files this report]"
186,19,9,Reporter Bill Keegan,"It's day two of the hunger strike started by the college-aged fraternity brothers who are demanding that all of South Park's community leaders step down. The PC frat brothers say they've gone now two days without eating any pussy, and will continue to do so until people resign."
187,19,9,Tom,Who is that reporter? Do we... know him?
188,19,9,Kevin,"Tom, that's Bill Keegan, WCFO."
189,19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Brian. [Jimmy sneaks past the newsmen in the background] He's working for the ads, obviously. Sellout douche-bag."
190,19,9,Newsman,"That's right, Tom. He was always a douche-bag at the conventions."
191,19,9,Tom,"Thanks, Rick. Stay dry."
192,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Leslie, come on."
193,19,9,Leslie,Jimmy. You're gonna help me?
194,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Yeah I'm gonna help you. I mean, come on."
195,19,9,Tom,Jimmy! [Jimmy and Leslie turn around]
196,19,9,Newsman 2,"Oh Jesus, he let her out."
197,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"PC Principal is our enemy, not her."
198,19,9,Tom,His dick is compromised. [spreads his arms out to protect the newsmen] Stay back! [the newsmen and Barbrady step back a few feet]
199,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,It is not my dick. I am thinking rationally and with logic. I am taking her out of here!
200,19,9,Tom,"Well then, [pulls a gun out of his inside coat pocket and aims it at Jimmy] I'm sorry I'm going to have to do this, Jimmy. [walks over to Barbrady and gives him the gun] Officer Barbrady, we need you to shoot these kids."
201,19,9,Officer Barbrady,What?
202,19,9,Tom,The ad has got to him. [puts Barbrady into a shooting stance] There's no time to argue.
203,19,9,Officer Barbrady,I'm not shooting any more kids.
204,19,9,Tom,Do you want to save your town?!
205,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Officer Barbrady, we have to stop PC Principal before it's too late."
206,19,9,Tom,"Barbrady, shoot them in their heads!"
207,19,9,Officer Barbrady,"No! I'm not shooting any more people! Not for you, not for nobody!"
208,19,9,Tom,"You're making the worst mistake of your life, officer."
209,19,9,Officer Barbrady,"Maybe so. All I know is I'm done shooting people! [his gun goes off and grazes Kevin on his left shoulder, causing it to bleed]"
210,19,9,Kevin,Augh!
211,19,9,Officer Barbrady,"Oh sorry. Jeez. [Jimmy and Leslie exit first, then Barbrady follows and closes the door]"
212,19,9,Tom,Dammit!
213,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Think about it, you guys. From the moment that PC Principal took over Kyle has been different. Haven't you noticed?"
214,19,9,Butters Stotch,Yeah.
215,19,9,Stan Marsh,"He's distracting us, either because he's too afraid or because he- [Kyle arrives with his lunch and sits next to him. Butters is stunned that Kyle showed up]"
216,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Well what are you guys talking about?
217,19,9,Butters Stotch,Nothin'.
218,19,9,Eric Cartman,Stan's calling you a traitor.
219,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,What?!
220,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, I think it's pretty obvious you don't want us investigating PC Principal."
221,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"And why do you think that, Stan?!"
222,19,9,Stan Marsh,I don't know.
223,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with PC Principal, it's you! Let's not forget that Stan's dad is PC Principal's little bitch!"
224,19,9,Butters Stotch,"Wuh huh, that's a good point."
225,19,9,Eric Cartman,I am loving this right now.
226,19,9,Stan Marsh,"My dad's stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle!"
227,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"It is you, isn't it?! That's why you're trying to shift the blame on me. That's very Cartman of you, Stan!"
228,19,9,Eric Cartman,Hoh that's low. [smiles]
229,19,9,Stan Marsh,Don't you dare call me a Cartman!
230,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"N-ho, that's good! Just keep on distracting everybody! It seems to be working, Cartman!"
231,19,9,Stan Marsh,"Fuck you, Kyle! [delivers a left hook and Kyle falls off the lunch bench]"
232,19,9,Eric Cartman,"Fight! [the kids gather round to watch. Half of them are cheering them on, the other half stay quiet. Nathan stops by to see what's going on.]"
233,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Time to take this asshole down!
234,19,9,Randy Marsh,"[gets in front of the group] Whoa whoa whoa, guys, whoa! We can't just go walking in there."
235,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Why not?
236,19,9,Randy Marsh,"This is a safe space. We're not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you're crossing the most sacred human boundary there is."
237,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,"J'hoh, give me a break."
238,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered."
239,19,9,Mr. Garrison,[determined] I can. Watch. [lifts up the PC tape and walks under and on to the house]
240,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Wow, how did you-? [Principal Victoria and Caitlyn Jenner do the same] Whoa."
241,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Burning the midnight oil, huh Nathan?"
242,19,9,Nathan,Jimmy.
243,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,You sonofabitch. What have you done to the Super School News?
244,19,9,Nathan,"I was just holding down the fort while you were away, Jim."
245,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,Writing headlines sponsored by PC Principal and the ads? How much did they pay you?!
246,19,9,Nathan,"Please, Jimmy, I'm just trying to survive here."
247,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Everyone's gonna know the truth, Nathan. We're getting a new edition of the school paper out by morning. Everyone's gonna know all about the ads. [Leslie punches him and he goes flying into a bookcase. She walks over and punches him five more times, then turns around and walks off to close the door. She returns and throws him up in the air. He hits the ceiling and falls to the floor. Leslie walks past Nathan, who laughs at Jimmy's misfortune]"
248,19,9,Leslie,Deal with him. [gets on the computer and starts searching]
249,19,9,Jimmy Valmer,Leslie... I thought we were b-b-b-besties.
250,19,9,Nathan,"Hey there, big man. Editor of the school paper, huh? You still don't even know half the story."
251,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,It's clear.
252,19,9,Mr. Garrison,Where is everybody? I thought the news said they're on a hunger strike.
253,19,9,Randy Marsh,It doesn't make sense. Someone's always here.
254,19,9,Principal Victoria,Take a look at this! [the other three adults walk over to see what she's seeing - the same State Farm ad of PC Principal and Leslie as before]
255,19,9,Mr. Garrison,What the hell?
256,19,9,Principal Victoria,It looks like he was researching this. You see this news story?
257,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"If this is true, then... PC Principal's trying to help."
258,19,9,Randy Marsh,Click on that. What is that?
259,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"No, click out of that. What is this?"
260,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"So, so then, so then Caitlyn says ""Look bitch, you're married to Bill Clinton. If anyone should be afraid of AIDS, it's you."""
261,19,9,Caitlyn Jenner,That stupid bitch had it coming. [they all laugh]
262,19,9,Mr. Garrison,"Oh God, I love you, Cait. We're so gong to win the primaries. [they all laugh]"
263,19,9,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, whoawhoawhoa wait wait wait. What, what were we doing again?"
264,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,Leslie.
265,19,9,Leslie,"You're trying to find out what's going on, right? But your friend is standing in your way?"
266,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,How do you know thi-?
267,19,9,Leslie,"I can show you what's going on, Kyle. But you have to trust me. [holds out her hand] What's the last four digits of your Sosh?"
268,19,9,Kyle Broflovski,"2692 [They shake hands, and he leaves the house with her]"
