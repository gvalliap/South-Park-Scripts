0,16,2,Randy Marsh,"Well, Dad, it was really great seeing you. We'd love to stay for dinner, but the food here gives Sharon diarrhea."
1,16,2,Sharon Marsh,What?! Randy!
2,16,2,Randy Marsh,[shushes her] Just trying to leave without being rude.
3,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"[rolls over to a small table next to the TV. There's a gift-wrapped box on it] Hold on, hold on just a second. I got a present for my grandson. [gets the box and wheels back to the family] Come here, Billy. [meets Stan in the middle of the room] You've grown up, Billy. It's time for you to have somethin' expensive and flashy [Stan smiles and glances back at his parents], to impress all the ladies [Stan takes the gift from him, then looks back at his parents]."
4,16,2,Sharon Marsh,"Go ahead and open it, Stan. [Stan opens the gift as Shelly and his parents surround him. Sharon kneels behind him and looks over his shoulder] Ohoho look at that! A bolo tie! Isn't that beautiful, Stan? [she puts it on him - gold base, turquoise center, diamonds surrounding it (12 small, 24 tiny)]"
5,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"That's 14 karat gold, with turquoise and reeeal diamonds."
6,16,2,Randy Marsh,"[approaches Marvin] Grandpa, how much did you spend on that?"
7,16,2,Marvin Marsh,Six thousand dollars.
8,16,2,Randy Marsh,Six thousand?!
9,16,2,Marvin Marsh,It's worth fifty thousand. The Jewels and Gems Shopping Network said so.
10,16,2,Randy Marsh,"Dad, you shouldn't be spending your retirement money on frivolous things! You should be saving it for when you die. That's ours!"
11,16,2,Sharon Marsh,"It's gorgeous, Dad, thank you. Oh, and tomorrow's picture day at school! Stan can wear it for his photo!"
12,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, that's wonderful! That'll make me feel reeeally good. Who's Stan?"
13,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Nice bolo tie, Stan."
14,16,2,Stan Marsh,[looks away to avoid eye contact] Thanks. [Kyle takes notice]
15,16,2,Eric Cartman,Bolo ties are... [quickly glances at Kyle] really in right now. Cool you have one.
16,16,2,Stan Marsh,"[annoyed] Look, it was a gift from my grandpa, okay? And it cost a lot of money."
17,16,2,Eric Cartman,"No, dude, it's... badass."
18,16,2,Stan Marsh,[angered] It happens to be worth six thousand dollars!
19,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,That... was six grand?
20,16,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah dude. It's a recreation of the bolo tie worn by King Henry V.
21,16,2,Eric Cartman,"...Dude, it's fucking gay as fuck."
22,16,2,Stan Marsh,"[finally breaks, facepalming] I know! [lowers his right arm] I really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something, he'd just give me the money!"
23,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Why don't you take it to one of those pawn places? Every two blocks you see a guy with a sign that says ""Cash For Gold and Jewelry."" There must be a lot of people doin' it."
24,16,2,Clerk 1,"You didn't steal this, did you?"
25,16,2,Stan Marsh,"No, my grandpa gave to me as a present. But it's worth so much I reel really bad accepting it, so I just want the cash."
26,16,2,Clerk 1,"[does some calculations on his computer] It's 14-karat gold, diamond and turquoise. I'll give you fifteen dollars."
27,16,2,Stan Marsh,...What? That cost my grandpa six thousand dollars. Those are real diamonds on the outside.
28,16,2,Clerk 1,"Yeah, I can't really make anything on the diamonds. I'd have to send it to a smelter, have it all smelted down for the gold, probably could make a ten-dollar profit."
29,16,2,Stan Marsh,Fifteen bucks?!
30,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, this guy's trying to rook us! We can go someplace else!"
31,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I'm not gettin' taken advantage of! [takes back the bolo tie]"
32,16,2,Eric Cartman,"You may suck our collective balls, sir! [they leave the store, turn right and walk]"
33,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,Don't worry. There's gotta be another cash for gold place around here somewhere.
34,16,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah! Here's one. [turns into the next store past the empty lot. The man outside is wearing a signboard]
35,16,2,Clerk 2,"These are real diamonds, right?"
36,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah dude, you can test them."
37,16,2,Clerk 2,Okay. Eight dollars.
38,16,2,Stan Marsh,"[stunned, then angry] This is the same bolo tie worn by King Henry V!"
39,16,2,Clerk 2,[looks it over again] Nine dollars.
40,16,2,Clerk 3,Welcome to Taco Bell. Would you like to try our Doritos Locos Tacos?
41,16,2,Stan Marsh,"I wanna see how much you'll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo. [hands the bolo to the clerk. The clerk looks it over, brings out his own pocket scope, and looks it over more closely]"
42,16,2,Clerk 3,"Fourteen-karat gold gets yaaa $14 a gram on the open market, got about... 4 grams here... [puts his scope away] It's not really worth my time. I guess I can give you a six-layer burrito for it."
43,16,2,Stan Marsh,A six-layer burrito?
44,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,You guys don't even make a six-layer burrito!
45,16,2,Clerk 3,"Alright, a seven-layer burrito! But that's as high as I'm going!"
46,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything. How? How does something like this happen?"
47,16,2,Dean,"Okay, folks, we are com-, half-way complete with today's broadcast. [scratches his nose] You wanna get in on these deals, call now. Next item is... This is item number 4 5 7 8 1 1 1. [switch to a close-up] Look at these stunning earrings. These are genuine faux sapphire earrings. Fourteen karat gold, 86 carat faux sapphire. Faux is a French word. Got an x in it, but you don't need to pronounce the x. How do you like that for prestigious? These earrings normally go for $6,000,000. We're gonna sell these today fer... [purses his lips together and exhales through them] $320!That's a steal. Now th-oh, there go the phones, they're lightin' up. I believe we have a sale? Do we have a sale? Yea- let's get her on the line. Hello? Who am I speakin' with?"
48,16,2,Vivian,Hello... my name is... Vivian.
49,16,2,Dean,"Vivian, you just got a heck of a deal. What's your last name, sweetheart?"
50,16,2,Vivian,Oh I... I can't remember.
51,16,2,Dean,You can't remember. Well can you remember your credit card number?
52,16,2,Vivian,3 7 1 5-
53,16,2,Dean,"Hold on, Vivivan, we'll get you on with a rep, take down that number. Thanks for shoppin' with us and congratulations on the lovely 14 karat gold sapphire earrings. At that price you practically stole them from us. Ouch. Okay-"
54,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, that's terrible!"
55,16,2,Eric Cartman,I told you guys. I've been watching all day.
56,16,2,Stan Marsh,"But, how do they get away with that?"
57,16,2,Eric Cartman,This is a new time. A new era of science that only the smartest can comprehend. [walks out]
58,16,2,Stan Marsh,What are you talking about?
59,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[standing next to a covered mobile whiteboard] For centuries alchemists have tried to come up with a formula to make gold. Whoever could do it would of course become rich, and now-! The chemical equation is right before our eyes. [unveils the equation]"
60,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,That's the chemical equation for gold?
61,16,2,Eric Cartman,"That's right. [goes through and denotes what each letter means] Guys with Cash For gold Signs gets you People's Unwanted Crappy Jewelry, which when added to a Cable-Based Shopping Network divided by Demented Old people equals Gold. [writes in ""= GOLD"" at the end]"
62,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"...Kenny, will you tell Cartman to shut up?"
63,16,2,Kenny McCormick,"(Shut the fuck up, dude! You're a fuckin' asshole!)"
64,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I'm an asshole for doin' math!"
65,16,2,Dean,"Oh my gosh, can you believe this? Somebody's about to get this $20,000 topaz and copper ring for just four thousand bucks. [a close-up of the ring] We've got our buyer on the line. You buyin' this as a gift, sir?"
66,16,2,Caller,"No, I'm buying it as a gift! For my grandson Billy!"
67,16,2,Stan Marsh,Grandpa? [gets off the sofa and runs out the front door]
68,16,2,Dean,"How about that, folks? That is Brazilian emerald, finest emerald available. We're letting this oen go fer... fourteen ninety five [$1495.00 onscreen], EZ Pay. We call it that to save you time. EZ is an abbreviation of easy. Fourteen ninety five, EZ Pay an... What's that? Okay, alright, I just got word, we are droppin' the Z from EZ Pay. It's now just E Pay. [onscreen EZ Pay is erased, then E Pay appears] By usin' the word E Pay instead of takin' all that time to say EZ Pay, we're savin' you a second of time, and those seconds add up. Go ahead and try it: say E Pay five thousand times. That's five thousand seconds, nine hours... we just saved you here on J&G Shoppin' Network. [Grandpa's eyes begin to wander] Not wastin' your time here, you can't afford not to buy this one. You don't have a lot of time left. Literally. Pass this one down to your kids, your grandkids. [Stan appears at the doorway] Show 'em your life had meaning."
69,16,2,Stan Marsh,Grandpa.
70,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"[turns his head to the left to look at Stan] Well you see that, Billy? That's an emerald on 14 karat gold. Don't you think your sister would like that? [smiles]"
71,16,2,Stan Marsh,"She doesn't like jewelry, Grandpa."
72,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Ha! Well she will one day. She'll appreciate it. She's, she's just a baby after all."
73,16,2,Stan Marsh,"She's not a baby, Grandpa, she's thirteen."
74,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Shelly's thirteen? Rihight. Right, boy... [faces the TV again, visibly shaken] Billy, did I ever tell you I used to have a border collie named Patches?"
75,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yes, Grandpa."
76,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"[reminiscing with a smile] I loved that dog. She always made me so happy. When she died, I... I didn't let myself get too sad, 'cause I thought, thought I'd always have the memory of her slobberin' happy face. [the smile disappears] I can't remember what she looked like, Billy... Huh. Huohh. [gets a headache and rests his head on his left hand]"
77,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry, Grandpa. I'm gonna take care of this! [turns to his left and leaves with determination. Marvin is left looking distressed]"
78,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Hey Craig. Goin' on? Token! Bet your mom has some old jewelry she wouldn't notice missing. Bebe! You got those rhinestones in your earrings, I'll have some walking cash! I can probably offer you a-"
79,16,2,Butters Stotch,[loses control of the sign] Whoops! [it lands face up on the snow]
80,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[quickly analyzing the situation] Butters, what the fuck?!"
81,16,2,Butters Stotch,"[winces, then massages his right arm] Sorry. My arms hurt."
82,16,2,Eric Cartman,"""My arms hurt."" Pick the fucking sign up, Butters! This is a business! [Butters picks the sign up and resumes twirling]"
83,16,2,Leroy Jenkins,Hey! How much will you give me for this? [shows him a ring with a huge rock on it]
84,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh ahhhh, three bucks."
85,16,2,Leroy Jenkins,"Okay. [gives the ring to Cartman, who transfers it to his left hand. Cartman reaches into his back pocket and give Leroy the three dollars. Leroy turns and walks away]"
86,16,2,Eric Cartman,We got crappy jewelry Butters. Now all we need are some old people.
87,16,2,Dean,"And that's it, we just sold this bracelet to Ms. Marcia Tubbs. Martha, thank you so much for your call. You just got yourself a heck of a deal on this one. You there Marcia?"
88,16,2,Marcia Tubbs,[over the phone] Yes. [a car honks at her] I'm lost. I'm lost walkin' on the freeway.
89,16,2,Dean,"Alright, you're lost walkin' on the freeway? Enjoy the Tiger's Eye Aquamarine bracelet. Alri- okay, what should we do next? Oh I see one. Here's a good'un. Lemme... [picks out a ring with a large yellow stone in the middle] Lemme... lemme set the stage for you here: you're goin' to that seniors' cocktail party? It's bingo night and you're lookin' for somethin' to wear? How about a 13 carat panzoto-panzanite ring. This is-oh! We got a caller already on this one! Hello sir, you must be a fan of panzoto-panzanite."
90,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, hi. Um, you should kill yourself?"
91,16,2,Dean,...What's that?
92,16,2,Stan Marsh,"I said, you should kill yourself? What you do is sort of, unjustifiable? And you know it's unjustifiable? And you don't care? You're the definition of evil? Kill yourself?"
93,16,2,Dean,"Okay, we're gonna sell this ring for just thirty-seven ninety five. [$3,795.00 onscreen] How's that? [puts the ring onto a woman's right ring finger.]"
94,16,2,Stan Marsh,I just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up Social Security checks? Kill yourself.
95,16,2,Dean,"Alright, well you shouldn't say things like that 'cause... some host of a jewelry channel sure might up and do it, and then you'd feel really bad."
96,16,2,Stan Marsh,No i wouldn't.
97,16,2,Dean,Yes you would.
98,16,2,Stan Marsh,"No, because I really want you to kill yourself."
99,16,2,Dean,"Alright, well how about this?! If a jewelry network host goes home tonight and blows the brains out, you might be liable. That's a lawsuit worth ...2.7 million dollars? How's that sound?"
100,16,2,Stan Marsh,"I don't care what happens to me, I care about my grandfather, you morally empty corrupted maggot!"
101,16,2,Dean,"[long silence as the jewelry carousel goes around] Alright, I tell you what: I'll bring the lawsuit down to twenty-nine thirty-nine- [the $6,000,000 is erased and replaced by $2,939.00]"
102,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Nono, uh it doesn't matter what price you put on anything! Your only chance to right the wrongs you've done, and repay all the elderly people whose lives you've destroyed, is to kill yourself."
103,16,2,Dean,"[another long silence, then he clears his throat] Well, you think it's funny, but that's, that's callin' up and tellin' someone to kill themselves; that's not a joke."
104,16,2,Stan Marsh,I'm not joking. [pause] Do it.
105,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, next item? Next item we're gonna do is uh, 5 5 2 1 6 uh 7, 7 5, 5 [actually 55-26177] This is-oh my God, look at this you guys. [shows off the ring Leroy sold him earlier] This is 200 carat Brazilian emerald and plasticine ring. I'm gonna start bidding for this ring at, um, let's see, eight billion dollars. Eight billion dollars, opening bid. We've gotta sell this ring today. Tell you what, I'm gonna take it down a little. We're gonna drop that price down to... $75.95. At this price it's not gonna last for lo-oh, we got a caller already, Butters? Butters? Look like- Did we sell it? Yep, seventy-five ninety-five, that's what the rung just sold for. Do we have the buyer on the line? Hello?"
106,16,2,Caller,Hello?
107,16,2,Eric Cartman,"YES, you just bought this lovely 200-carat ring. How do you feel, Mrs...?"
108,16,2,Mrs Appleby,This is Mrs. Appleby on 24 Palmark Lane?
109,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Can I ask you something, Mrs. Appleby? Do you like fucking little boys?"
110,16,2,Mrs Appleby,[long pause] I'm sorry?
111,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Just wondering if you fuck kids all the time, 'cause that's what you just did with this deal. You just got an $8,000,000,000 ring for seventy-five ninety-five. You fucked me good, Mrs. Appleby. Congratulations, ma'am."
112,16,2,Mrs Appleby,Thank you.
113,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Were you just flippin' through the channels and saw me selling this ring and thought ""Hm, I'd like to fuck that kid!"""
114,16,2,Mrs Appleby,...I thought it'd be a lovely gift for my granddaughter Jessica. She's captain of the debate team at Jefferson High School. see-
115,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh-kay, thanks for shopping with us. I gotta get the taste of old lady dick out of my mouth."
116,16,2,Mrs Appleby,Goodbye.
117,16,2,Eric Cartman,Bye! Man that's good acting. I should get an award.
118,16,2,Stan Marsh,Do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories?! No! Because you don't have someone in your life suffering from Alzheimer's! Well I do!
119,16,2,Manager,"Look, kid, if you've got a beef with the system, you're talkin' to the wrong people. All we do is smelter down what we get from the cash for gold places."
120,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah?! Well there's an old Hindu saying: ""Whoever smelt it, dealt it!"""
121,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,Yeah!
122,16,2,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck yeah!)
123,16,2,Manager,"We aren't the ones who denied you what your jewelry was really worth. The Hindu saying is actually ""Mayii nahii chahatapahnii"""
124,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,What does that mean?
125,16,2,Manager,"""Whoever denied it, [lowers his voice] supplied it."" [the boys are stunned]"
126,16,2,Stan Marsh,"YOU are the scums of the earth! Old people are victimized by shopping networks and YOU kick back in your fat-cat mansions, making billions!"
127,16,2,Butters Stotch,"[looks around at his fellow sign twirlers] We aren't makin' that much, fellas."
128,16,2,Stan Marsh,You're not?
129,16,2,Twirler 1,"Who don't you yell at the people who melt the gold down? The old Hindu saying is ""Whever smelt it dealt it"" [other twirlers agree with him: ""Yeah!"" ""That's right!""]"
130,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"[leans forward] Nuh uh! It's ""Whoever denied it, supplied it!"""
131,16,2,Twirler 2,"You got it all wrong. The jewelry that those shopping networks sell don't even come from us! It's all made in India, where those Hindu rhymes come from!"
132,16,2,Twirler 3,"What are you saying, Gustav? My God, do you mean?"
133,16,2,Twirler 4,That's right. Whoever made the rhyme did the crime.
134,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Suck my balls, suck my balls... [enters the store] Hello!"
135,16,2,Clerk 4,[An Asian woman] Ohhhh welcoooome! Welcome to discount jewelry stohhhhh! [her two assistants join her as Cartman takes a seat at the counter]
136,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[shoves his briefcase to one side] Yeah, listen, I'm running a retail business, but I can't get enough of people's unwanted crappy jewelry to keep up, so I'd like to buy some of yours."
137,16,2,Clerk 4,[claps way too quickly] Ohhhhh you so good foh biiiziness! [points to her brain] You so clehhvahh.
138,16,2,Eric Cartman,"I get by. Let's see, I'm gonna need some gold necklaces, diamond bracelets, and emerald earrings."
139,16,2,Clerk 4,"Okay, what emero do you rike?"
140,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, I don't know, I guess I'll take that ring there."
141,16,2,Clerk 4,Ohhhh you make so good chooice! Oh it's beauuutiful! [shows her aides] Look it's beauuutiful! [they too clap way too quickly]
142,16,2,Eric Cartman,"And uh, maybe I'll that one for three hundred."
143,16,2,Clerk 4,"Oh, that's best one! You so clevohh! [claps quickly a few times] You take advantage o'my low pricess! [claps a few times]"
144,16,2,Eric Cartman,How about that panzanite bracelet for nine ninety five.
145,16,2,Clerk 4,"You got good eye, [points to her brain] You so clehhvahh. I getting taken advantaaage! You rike to fuck an Asian lady?"
146,16,2,Eric Cartman,[long pause] What d'ja say?
147,16,2,Clerk 4,"I know, you walk by my stoh and you say ""Oh, there's a nice Asian lady. I think I go in and I fuck hurh,"" you Asian-lady fucker you!"
148,16,2,Eric Cartman,Wait a minute. How much do you pay for this stuff?
149,16,2,Clerk 4,"Oh, I pay thousands! And you come heuh an' fuck me!"
150,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Okay, quit the act! I'm not fucking you and you know it!"
151,16,2,Clerk 4,"Nono, you fucked me!"
152,16,2,Eric Cartman,"Nono, you fucked me! Fuck you!"
153,16,2,Butters Stotch,"Oh sorry, sorry. [looks back at his seat and pulls out the sign. then points it at Cartman. Cartman then hops out and proceeds to the plant, with Butters following]"
154,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[to the receptionist] You see, I'm looking to cut out the middle man. I want to buy my jewelry direct from you so that- [a disturbing sight stops him in his tracks] Motherfucker!"
155,16,2,Stan Marsh,[railing at an older Indian boy] You should be ashamed of the people in America that you are exploiting! How dare you take advantage of those less fortunate?! [Kenny and Kyle are with him]
156,16,2,Eric Cartman,"[approaches the other boys] You dirty double-crossing assholes! You're trying to cut me out, huh?! You guys stole my formula, then tried to fuck me- Butters!"
157,16,2,Butters Stotch,Sorry! [catches up to him]
158,16,2,Eric Cartman,-and then tried to fuck me out of your business!
159,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,"We're not fucking you, they're fucking Stan's grandpa!"
160,16,2,Eric Cartman,"No, they're getting fucked by Asian ladies!"
161,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Somebody is at the head of all this, and somebody needs to pay! All I want is some Goddamned retribution for my Goddamned grandpa! [the boy reaches for a necklace and offers it to Stan] No! Not a diamond-and-gold necklace! [the boy thinks about what to do with the necklace, then reaches for a small plastic pouch and puts it in. The boy motions to another boy]"
162,16,2,Kyle Broflovski,What's he doing?
163,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Oh, yeah. Actually, this might kind of work."
164,16,2,Stan Marsh,"So the we went to India, which is pretty cool I guess. I've never been there before. And we basically learned that whoever smelt it, denied it, and rhymed it actually dealt it."
165,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Ahh, sounds like you had a fun weekend."
166,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway Grandpa, I wanted to give you something. [hands him the gift]"
167,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"Oh, for me? [takes the gift and unwraps it] Oh! My God. There she is. [a picture of Grandpa in younger days with his dog] Old Patches. There's that slobberin' happy face! Thank you Billy. That means a lot. [they smile at each other for a moment] Billy, that... that bolo tie you're wearing?"
168,16,2,Stan Marsh,Yeah.
169,16,2,Marvin Marsh,"I don't know where you got that, but it's fucking gay as fuck."
170,16,2,Stan Marsh,"Cool. I, I won't wear it anymore."
171,16,2,Marvin Marsh,That's a good idea. [looks back at the picture and smiles. Stan looks down and away]
172,16,2,Dean,"Folks, these are not your ordinary peridot craponite earrings, these are 18-karat gold! and we got-oh, do we have a buyer on the line? Hello?"
173,16,2,Caller 1,[long pause] What are you waiting for? Kill yourself.
174,16,2,Dean,"Alright Goddamnit, we got another comedian. Ever since that little kid called up, now everybody wants to call and tell me I should kill myself."
175,16,2,Caller 1,He was right. Do it.
176,16,2,Dean,"Folks, this is an 800 number. Every time you call and tell me to kill myself, it's costing us... two dollars and thirty six cents! So now, how about a caller who wants to buy jewelry ? Yes. Hello, sir?"
177,16,2,Caller 2,"You're too scared to do it, aren't-cha? You don't have the balls."
178,16,2,Dean,Goddamnit I'm not scared to do it.
179,16,2,Caller 2,"New, you're scared. You got, you got lady balls. [hangs up. The dial tone is heard and Dean moves on to the next call]"
180,16,2,Caller 3,Hello? I'm calling about the peridot earrings?
181,16,2,Dean,Yes ma'am!
182,16,2,Caller 3,They'd look good on your dead body. Why don't you kill yourself?
183,16,2,Dean,"Alright, that's that! That there's the- the straw that broke the camel's back! I got a gun right here; whattaya think about that?!"
184,16,2,Caller 3,Put it against your temple and pull the trigger. [long pause. The gun is cocked and then goes off. A thump is heard and blood lands all over the set. The soothing music plays on]
