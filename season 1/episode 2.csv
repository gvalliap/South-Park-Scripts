0,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan, did you see that rainbow this morning?"
1,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, it was huge."
2,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Ugh, I hate those things."
3,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Nobody hates rainbows.
4,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, what's there to hate about rainbows?"
5,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Well, you know, you'll just be sitting there, minding your own business, and they'll come, marching in and crawl up your leg and start biting the inside of your ass, and you'll be all like: ""EHY! GET OUT OF MY ASS YOU STUPID RAINBOWS!"" [Silence.]"
6,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?"
7,1,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm talking about rainbows, I hate those friggin' things!"
8,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Rainbows are those little arches of color that show up during a rainstorm.
9,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Ohh, rainbows. Oh yeah, I like those, those are cool."
10,1,2,Stan Marsh,What were you talking about?
11,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Huh? Oh, nothing, forget it."
12,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"No, what marches in, crawls up your leg and bites the inside of your ass?"
13,1,2,Eric Cartman,Nothing..!
14,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Children, children. Remember the 'Save Our Fragile Planet' essay contest that you children worked so hard on last month? [Silence.] One of our very own South Park students has won the national prize."
15,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[Softly.] Wow, I knew I would win."
16,1,2,Mr Hat,"Gosh Mr. Garrison, this sure is exciting."
17,1,2,Mr Garrison,"That's right Mr. Hat, the winner of the national 'Save Our Fragile Planet' contest is... Eric Cartman."
18,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,What?
19,1,2,Eric Cartman,What?
20,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Congratulations Eric, on writing the award winning paper."
21,1,2,Eric Cartman,Kick ass!
22,1,2,Stan Marsh,"That's impossible, Cartman doesn't know a rain-forest from a Pop-Tart."
23,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah I do, pop tarts are frosted."
24,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Out of over a million papers, Eric's was chosen as the grand prize winner."
25,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, what did you write about Cartman?"
26,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh, you know, this and that."
27,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,He doesn't even know what he wrote about!
28,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,What was your paper about Wendy?
29,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,My paper was on the suffering of bottle-nose dolphins.
30,1,2,Eric Cartman,"There you see, you shouldn't have written a paper about dolphins. Dolphins are stupid."
31,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, dolphins are like the second smartest animal on the planet."
32,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Buh, hah, right, if they're so damn smart, how come they get caught in those fishing nets all the time?"
33,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,What?
34,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Wait, wait, there's more. It says here that Eric's trophy will be presented to him by...Kathie Lee Gifford."
35,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Kathie Lee is coming to South Park?
36,1,2,Mr Garrison,And the presentation will be on national television.
37,1,2,Stan Marsh,Television!
38,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Television!
39,1,2,Mr Garrison,[Thinking to himself.] Kathie Lee Gifford. I don't believe it.
40,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Kathie Lee Gifford in South Park! Oh my God! This is our chance to make a name for ourselves; to show that we're not just some piss-ant white-bread mountain town.
41,1,2,Ted,"Better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity."
42,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Yes! If I can show just how much I turned South Park around, I could become a Senator."
43,1,2,Johnson,Maybe even a State Senator.
44,1,2,Ted,"Mayor, we should decorate the town square."
45,1,2,Johnson,"Then we should have the chef of the school cafeteria sing a song, and play up the ethnic diversity of our town."
46,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"That's right, he's a black guy isn't he?"
47,1,2,Ted,Black as the night itself Mayor.
48,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Yes! And we can even have the children of South Park put on a little play. Kathie Lee loves children.
49,1,2,Ted,If they're working in a sweat-shop that is.
50,1,2,Johnson,Ohhh.
51,1,2,Ted,Ouch. [Johnson Laughs.] Thank you.
52,1,2,Eric Cartman,"You guys, guess what? After I'm on television, I'm gonna be totally famous."
53,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,[Passing by.] Hitler was famous too.
54,1,2,Chef,[Stopping by.] Hello there children.
55,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, Chef."
56,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Chef."
57,1,2,Chef,How are my little crackers today?
58,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Good.
59,1,2,Stan Marsh,Good.
60,1,2,Chef,Did you all hear about the news? Kathie Lee Gifford is coming to South Park.
61,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, cause Cartman cheated and won the environmental essay contest."
62,1,2,Eric Cartman,Hey!
63,1,2,Chef,Yeahyeh. Oh whatever. But the mayor just called and asked me to sing at the ceremony.
64,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, are you gonna do it?"
65,1,2,Chef,"Of course! Kathie Lee is a beautiful, sultry queen of sexual fantasy. And if I sing to her, maybe I can lure her into a night of exotic delectation."
66,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, that'd be cool."
67,1,2,Kenny McCormick,"(How big's your penis, Chef?)"
68,1,2,Chef,"Well, three times bigger than Frank Gifford's, anyway."
69,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh, I can't even concentrate on grading papers with all this excitement."
70,1,2,Mr Garrison,Why are you looking at me like that Mr. Hat?
71,1,2,Mr Hat,[Now on Mr. Garrison's hand.] Have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that Kathie Lee Gifford caused you?
72,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Mmm, mmm, Mr. Hat, that was a long time ago, and, and I was only a child."
73,1,2,Mr Hat,"We could have won that talent show, we could have been huge."
74,1,2,Lil Mr Garrison,"Knock knock, Mr. Hat."
75,1,2,Mr Hat,Who's there?
76,1,2,Lil Mr Garrison,Orange.
77,1,2,Mr Hat,Orange who?
78,1,2,Lil Mr Garrison,Orange you glad I didn't say banana?
79,1,2,Mr Hat,Thank you.
80,1,2,Lil Mr Garrison,"Wow Mr. Hat, looks like we might win."
81,1,2,Show Announcer,"And now our last talent show finalist, Kathie Lee Epstein."
82,1,2,Lil Kathie Lee,"If they could see me now, that little gang of mine.
I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine.
I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact
The kind of top-drawer first-rate chums I attract
[Mexican puppet] All I can say is, ""Wow-wee, look-a where I am.""
[Tourist puppet] Tonight I landed, Pow!, right in a pot of jam.
What a setup! Holy Cow!
They'd never believe it, if my friends could see me now!"
83,1,2,Mr Garrison,"It, it wasn't fair. She had choreography. How could we compete with that?"
84,1,2,Mr Hat,"But now she's coming to South Park, and I know a way to make it all better."
85,1,2,Mr Garrison,How?
86,1,2,Mr Garrison,"No, Mr. Hat, I couldn't kill Kathie Lee Gifford!"
87,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Children, as you all know, Miss Kathie Lee Gifford will be in South Park to present the award to some kid for an essay."
88,1,2,Eric Cartman,That kid is me.
89,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Whatever. Now, I'm going to have you luscious little youngsters do a play about the history of South Park."
90,1,2,Mr Garrison,"That'll be wonderful, won't it Mr. Hat."
91,1,2,Mr Hat,[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.
92,1,2,Mr Garrison,[Whispers.] Mr. Hat!
93,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, I'm asking you to direct our little play."
94,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh, that's perfect. You see Mr. Hat, we don't have to kill her. We can just upstage her."
95,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Mrs. Mayor, you might want to review the essays. We think Cartman might have cheated."
96,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Who cares? Now kids, what's say we give it our South Park best!"
97,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,And who's our little prize winner again?
98,1,2,Eric Cartman,Me! Eric Cartman!
99,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"How about we get in shape, huh? We want to look our best for the TV cameras don't we?"
100,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Yes ma'am. [Sings.]
I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television."
101,1,2,Eric Cartman,"[Still singing.]
...I'm gonna be on television,
I'm gonna be on television..."
102,1,2,Stan Marsh,"[Turning to face Cartman.] We don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy."
103,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Egh, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish."
104,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Dude, dolphins are intelligent and friendly."
105,1,2,Eric Cartman,Intelligent and friendly on rye bread with some mayonnaise.
106,1,2,Stan Marsh,Dolphins are way smarter than you!
107,1,2,Eric Cartman,"If they're so smart, why do they live in igloos?"
108,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Dolphins don't live in igloos, that's Eskimos!"
109,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Dolphins, Eskimos, who cares?! It's all a bunch of tree hugging hippie crap!"
110,1,2,Stan Marsh,Tell me what you wrote about!
111,1,2,Eric Cartman,I can't. I have to go home and get in shape.
112,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, right! You'll go and sit in front of the TV and eat Cheesy Poofs, ass-master!"
113,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Screw you, hippie!"
114,1,2,TV Announcer,"We'll be right back to Jesus and Pals, after this."
115,1,2,Beefcake,Hey!! You need to get in shape fast?! Wanna look your best?! Tired the other guys getting all the chicks?! Are you tired of being a 90 pound weakling?!
116,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I only weigh 90 pounds."
117,1,2,Beefcake,"Then bulk up quick, with Weight Gain 4000!!"
118,1,2,Eric Cartman,Yes!
119,1,2,Beefcake,"With over 4,000 grams of saturated fat per serving, its patented formula is designed to enter the mouth, and go to directly to the stomach where it is distributed to the bloodstream. Now available in stores everywhere. Get some today, and say with me: 'Beefcake!'"
120,1,2,Eric Cartman,Beefcake!
121,1,2,Beefcake,Beefcake!
122,1,2,Eric Cartman,Beefcake!
123,1,2,Beefcake,Beefcake!
124,1,2,Beefcake,[In unison] BEEFCAKE!
125,1,2,Eric Cartman,[In unison] BEEFCAKE!
126,1,2,TV Announcer,May cause irreversible damage to the kidneys and liver...
127,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Mom, can you get me some Weight Gain 4000?"
128,1,2,Liane Cartman,"Okay Eric, I'll get you some at the store tomorrow."
129,1,2,Eric Cartman,"But mom, I need it for tomorrow."
130,1,2,Liane Cartman,But tomorrow is grocery day Eric.
131,1,2,Eric Cartman,"[Shrieking.] Mm-mo-om, Ah-ee née-eed suh-ome Weight Gain Four Thousaaand! I need iiit!"
132,1,2,Liane Cartman,"Okay, okay, then. I guess I'll be going to the store now then."
133,1,2,Mr Garrison,"No, no!"
134,1,2,Mr Hat,[In a demonic voice.] Kill her.
135,1,2,Mr Garrison,"No, Mr. Hat, I won't do it."
136,1,2,Mr Hat,Kill!
137,1,2,Mr Garrison,"That does it, you're going in the dresser drawer, Mr. Hat."
138,1,2,Mr Hat,She'll make a fool of you again.
139,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Well, you can just stay in that drawer Negative Nancy."
140,1,2,Eric Cartman,Hey dudes.
141,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"What the hell is wrong with you, Cartman? Haven't you noticed the three feet of snow on the ground?"
142,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Listen! I have a nice body and I want to show it off, you got that?"
143,1,2,Stan Marsh,What? You've got to weight 90 pounds.
144,1,2,Eric Cartman,"I'm up to 94, thank you very much."
145,1,2,Kenny McCormick,(They're the biggest breasts that I've seen)
146,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, they're almost as big as his mom's."
147,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Laugh all you want, I'm the one who's gonna be on TV, looking all buff."
148,1,2,Stan Marsh,What's that stuff?
149,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Weight Gain 4000, it's helping me bulk up."
150,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Bulk up to what, fat-ass?"
151,1,2,Stan Marsh,Super fat-ass?
152,1,2,Eric Cartman,Ey! I don't have to take that kind of crap from you scrawny weaklings!
153,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Eh, eh. Sweet. Check me out, I'm such a beefcake I can't even get through the door. Eh."
154,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Come on people. We've got to turn this place around. Hang up the lights, string up the banners, castrate the cows!"
155,1,2,Cows,[Out in a pasture.] Mooooo?
156,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Well Mr. Garrison, how is the little play going?"
157,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Huh? Oh, fine. We were just about to run it from the top."
158,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, please do. I'm dying to see it."
159,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Okay, all the little pioneers on this side of the stage."
160,1,2,Mr Garrison,Good. And all the little Indians go to the center of the stage.
161,1,2,Clyde Donovan,"Am I an Indian, or a pioneer?"
162,1,2,Mr Garrison,Do you have a feather on your head?
163,1,2,Clyde Donovan,Yes.
164,1,2,Mr Garrison,Then you're an Indian.
165,1,2,Clyde Donovan,Oh.
166,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Okay Bebe, this is your line."
167,1,2,Bebe Stevens,[Haltingly.] This is the story of South Park. It begins over a hundred years ago. When the noble and hardy Ute Indians lived on the land.
168,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, don't they look adorable?"
169,1,2,Bebe Stevens,"Then, from the east, came the great white pioneers."
170,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Oh my God!
171,1,2,Mr Garrison,"They did it a lot better this morning, they had more energy."
172,1,2,Bebe Stevens,"The pioneers met with the Indians, and negotiated for their fertile lands."
173,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, we can not have our children beating each other senseless in front of Kathie Lee Gifford."
174,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Well, what do you want? This is how it happened in those days."
175,1,2,Stan Marsh,Take that you stupid Indian!
176,1,2,Clyde Donovan,Dow!
177,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, this is not appropriate. Do you actually think Kathie Lee Gifford would enjoy this?!?"
178,1,2,Mr Garrison,To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!
179,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Oh my God, what have I said?"
180,1,2,Townsman,"He said, ""To hell with Kathie Lee Gifford!"""
181,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Mr. Garrison, I am dismissing you from directing our play."
182,1,2,Mr Hat,[In his deep voice.] It happened again didn't it? Now we do things my way.
183,1,2,Mr Garrison,I can't kill her Mr. Hat...you're gonna have to do it.
184,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Whoa, Cartman. Talk about wide load."
185,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, I'm really starting to fill out nicely."
186,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"You're not filling out nicely, you're fatter than ever!"
187,1,2,Eric Cartman,I'm not fat! I'm getting in shape!
188,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, you're such a fat ass that when you walk down the street people go ""God damn it, that's a big fat ass!"""
189,1,2,Eric Cartman,"No they don't, you jealous weakling!"
190,1,2,Townsman,"God damn, that's a big fat ass!"
191,1,2,Eric Cartman,Hey!
192,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,Hi guys.
193,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh look, another hippie."
194,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Peace, Wendy."
195,1,2,Stan Marsh,Shut up Cartman!
196,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Oooh, 
Two little hippies sit'n' in a tree..."
197,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,I'm gonna find Cartman's paper and get to the bottom of this.
198,1,2,Eric Cartman,...K I S S I N G. First comes the baby and...
199,1,2,Jimbo Kern,Can I help you?
200,1,2,Mr Garrison,Yes... I need a gun.
201,1,2,Jimbo Kern,"Would this be for hunting, home protection, or other?"
202,1,2,Mr Garrison,Other.
203,1,2,Jimbo Kern,"Alrighty then! May I suggest a Stratford 12mm? Here, try it on!"
204,1,2,Jimbo Kern,That looks really nice on you. The lacquered black really matches your eyes.
205,1,2,Mr Garrison,"[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me?  You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] I don't know, it's a little small."
206,1,2,Jimbo Kern,"Okay, how about this?"
207,1,2,Mr Garrison,"[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? [To Jimbo.] Hmm, no, I don't like this one either."
208,1,2,Jimbo Kern,"Here's the same gun, with a wood finish."
209,1,2,Mr Garrison,"[To Mirror.] You talkin' to me? I don't see anybody else around here, so you must be talkin' to me. [To Jimbo.] I'll take it!"
210,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,Hello?
211,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"My essay by Eric Cartman: ""When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."""
212,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Well, Mr. Hat, I guess ol' Kathie Lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow. She beat us in the talent show all those years ago. And I think we owe her for that. Babang!"
213,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,[Hushed.] Oh my God.
214,1,2,Townsman,"Howdy Mr. Garrison, nice gun."
215,1,2,Mr Garrison,Thank you.
216,1,2,Townswoman,Nice gun Mr. Garrison.
217,1,2,Mr Garrison,Thanks.
218,1,2,Mr Garrison,Hello Officer Barbrady.
219,1,2,Officer Barbrady,Nice Gun.
220,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Thanks. Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee."
221,1,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hmmmm. You know, I think the book depository would be a good bet."
222,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Yes, that might do quite nicely. Thank you Officer Barbrady."
223,1,2,Officer Barbrady,No problem.
224,1,2,Officer Barbrady,Heah! Caught you red handed. No Pictures of Kathie Lee!
225,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,[On stage.] Where is she?
226,1,2,Eric Cartman,This is sweet. Camera crews are setting up and I'm looking totally ripped. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!
227,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,I don't think they're going to be able to get all of you in frame Cartman.
228,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[Rushing in.] You guys, we have to stop him!"
229,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,Stop who?
230,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,Mr. Garrison. He's going to try to kill Kathie Lee Gifford.
231,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Oh no you don't, you're not going to ruin my moment of fame."
232,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,He's got a gun!
233,1,2,Eric Cartman,"You got to get over this whole jealousy thing. Eihh, seriously. Just face it, I wrote a better paper than you."
234,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"It just so happens that I have your paper, and I know why you won! There's something more important right now. Let's go!"
235,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, you got to prioritize. What's more important? Being on TV or some stupid assassination?"
236,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[Sweetly.] Stan, I can't do it alone. Please?"
237,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Uh oh, we're losing him."
238,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Here she comes.
239,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Damn, I guess I'm not the only person in America who's thought of killing Kathie Lee Gifford."
240,1,2,Townswoman,"We love you Kathie Lee, heh heh."
241,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,"I love you, too."
242,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Come on you little bitch. [Takes aim.] You got to come out of your precious bubble sooner or later, missy."
243,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,[On stage.] It is with great pride and honor that I'd like to welcome Mrs. Kathie Lee Gifford to South Park.
244,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"...And now, our very own South Park Elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of Mrs. Lee Gifford."
245,1,2,Chef,"Thank you Mr. Mayor. You know Kathie Lee, you are a very special woman. I don't mean special in a Mary Tyler Moore way. Or, or special in an Extra Value Meal at Happy Burger way. Noo nononono. I mean special. Like the song of uh, the humming bird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long. Just two humming birds moaning and, and groaning and, and their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.

Oh, Kathie Lee, how I'd love to lay you dowwwwn.
And lick every inch of your bodaay with my tongue."
246,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,What?
247,1,2,Chef,"Kathie Lee, you're my sexual fantasy."
248,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,What? Oh God!
249,1,2,Chef,How 'bout you and meee-
250,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Uh, Thank you Chef, for that heartwarming song."
251,1,2,Chef,"-get together and make... sweet... 

 love?"
252,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,Thank you Chef!
253,1,2,Chef McDaniels,"Oh, oh. God bless you Kathie Lee!"
254,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"[Wendy and Stan run up.] Officer Barbrady, Mr. Garrison is about to kill Kathie Lee! We have to find him!"
255,1,2,Officer Barbrady,What? You mean the teacher? Wait a minute. [Flashes back.]
256,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Is there somewhere in town where I can get a good, clear shot - er, view - of Kathie Lee."
257,1,2,Officer Barbrady,"Hmm, you know, I think the book depository would be a good bet—I think the book depository would be a good bet—book depository—depository—depository—depository ..."
258,1,2,Officer Barbrady,"Damn, he could be anywhere! I'll send out an APB!"
259,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Wendy, look!"
260,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, here to present the award for the environmental essay to our own, Eric Kauffman..."
261,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Cartman, God damn it."
262,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"...is your favorite celebrity, and mine, [Crowd cheers.] Kathie Lee Gifford!"
263,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,Thank you. I love you all.
264,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Mr. Garrison, stop!"
265,1,2,Mr Garrison,Leave us. We must finish what we have begun.
266,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,I know that she's hurt you. She's hurt a lot of people.
267,1,2,Mr Garrison,You can't know.
268,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,You should have won that talent show.
269,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,"It is with great honor and pride that I present the winner his trophy. Eric, would you please come up here?"
270,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Here it is, my big moment of fame."
271,1,2,Mr Garrison,...and then she finished it all by throwing her voice with two dummies at once.
272,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"I know that Mr. Garrison, but this isn't the answer."
273,1,2,Mr Garrison,"It is... too late for me, young Wendy."
274,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"You see, I've learned something today, you can't win all the time, and if you don't win, you certainly can't hold it against the person who did, because that's the only way you ever really lose."
275,1,2,Mr Garrison,You... you're right.
276,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,Gooood.
277,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Man, did she really throw her voice with two dummies at once?"
278,1,2,Mr Hat,[Snapping into position.] The bitch must die!
279,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,Ooohhhh!
280,1,2,Kenny McCormick,(Oh no!)
281,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Huh, Oh my God, they killed Kenny! You bastard!"

284,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, come back! We didn't even get to do our play."
285,1,2,TV Crew Director,"I guess that's it, guys. Wrap it up."
286,1,2,Eric Cartman,Hey! Wait a minute! When do I get to be on television?
287,1,2,TV Crew Director,"Forget it kid. No Kathie Lee, no public interest."
288,1,2,Eric Cartman,[Whining.] But I won the environmental essay contest.
289,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,You don't deserve to win Cartman. And you know it.
290,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"I'm holding Cartman's award winning paper. It's actually nothing more than Walden, with Henry David Thoreau's name crossed out, and Cartman's name written in its place."
291,1,2,Townsman 1,Who cares?
292,1,2,Townsman 2,"Yeah, Kathie Lee Gifford's gone."
293,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Wha, What about, not holding anything against the person who wins?"
294,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Well, not if it's Cartman."
295,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Hey, where are you all going!"
296,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,They don't even know what Walden is.
297,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,I bet if Walden was a sitcom you'd all know what it was.
298,1,2,Stan Marsh,"Come on Wendy, Kyle's mom will make us tuna fish sandwiches."
299,1,2,Wendy Testaburger,"Ah, what the hell."
300,1,2,Mayor McDaniels,"Nohoho nooo. Now I'll be stuck in this Podunk town forever, with all these stupid hick, redneck, jobless, truck driving idiots!"
301,1,2,Ted,"Uh, Mayor, the mic is on."
302,1,2,Officer Barbrady,"[Arresting Mr. Hat.] Thought you could get away with it, eh Mr. Hat?"
303,1,2,Mr Hat,"Well, I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling kids."
304,1,2,Officer Barbrady,You're lucky that you missed Kathie Lee Gifford and that nobody got hurt.
305,1,2,Stan Marsh,We hope you can come back to school real soon Mr. Garrison.
306,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Well children, I'd love to, but the doctors say that Mr. Hat needs more therapy."
307,1,2,Mr Hat,We can still get her! Let mmm--
308,1,2,Mr Garrison,I'm just so sorry that I ruined everyone's chances for being on TV.
309,1,2,Kyle Broflovski,"Not Cartman, he gets to be on TV anyway."
310,1,2,Mr Garrison,"Really, on what?"
311,1,2,Geraldo Rivera,"Obesity, adiposity, corpulence... Whatever word you use, it represents one thing: Being a big fat-ass. We have with us today, live via satellite, Eric Cartman from South Park, who is now so obese he can't even get out of his house."
312,1,2,Eric Cartman,When is this going to be on the air?
313,1,2,Geraldo Rivera,Is there anything you'd like to say to people out there?
314,1,2,Eric Cartman,"Follow your dreams, you can reach your goals; I'm living proof. Beefcake. Beefcaaake!"
315,1,2,Chef,He needs to run his ass around the block a few times.
316,1,2,Kathie Lee Gifford,"Hmmm, how about a little more of that good lovin' Chef?"
317,1,2,Chef,"Damn woman, I just gave you sweet loving five minutes ago. You trying to kill me?"
