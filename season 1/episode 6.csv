20,1,6,TV Announcer,And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
21,1,6,Phillip,"Hey Terrance, I think I have to fart."
22,1,6,Terrance,"Wait, before you do, pull my thumb."
23,1,6,Stan Marsh,Heheheh hehehe...
24,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Uhhhhh
25,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Ah, dammit!"
26,1,6,Granpa,How would you like to make a dollar Billy?
27,1,6,Stan Marsh,"My name's not Billy grandpa, it's Stan."
28,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Dammit Billy, do you want a dollar or don't ya?"
29,1,6,Stan Marsh,Sure.
30,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Ok. You just have to do one thing for me.
31,1,6,Stan Marsh,I'm not gonna kill you grandpa.
32,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Why not?
33,1,6,Stan Marsh,"'Cause, I'll get in trouble."
34,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,I killed my grandpa when I was your age.
35,1,6,Stan Marsh,Leave me alone grandpa.
36,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,What has America's youth come to? Kids won't even kill their own grandparents.
37,1,6,Phillip,"Hey Terrance, now that you've farted, I think I might fart too."
38,1,6,Terrance,"Ohhh, you farted."
39,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, bubbe, what are you watching?"
40,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, would you like a flower?"
41,1,6,Phillip,I sure would Terrance.
42,1,6,Terrance,"Alrighty then, here's a two-lip."
43,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,What is this?
44,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,It's horrible!
45,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, it's Terrance & Phillip."
46,1,6,Phillip,Take that you stupid dick.
47,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,What did he say?
48,1,6,Terrance,You're an asshole Phillip.
49,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat?!!?
50,1,6,Shiela,"Young man, you are not to watch that show anymore! It's immature toilet humor!"
51,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,But everybody watches Terrance & Phillip.
52,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Oh really? Is that so?
53,1,6,Terrance,"Oh no Phillip, looks like you're about to fart."
54,1,6,Phillip,You're exactly right Terrance. Oh.
55,1,6,Terrance,Oh no.
56,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Ha, ha, ha, that's sweet!"
57,1,6,Liane Cartman,"Eric dear? I just got a call from your friend Kyle's mother. She said that this show is naughty, and might make you a potty mouth."
58,1,6,Eric Cartman,That's a bunch of crap! Kyle's mom is a dirty Jew!
59,1,6,Liane Cartman,"Ohhh, okay hon."
60,1,6,Stan Marsh,I'm not going to kill you grandpa!
61,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Ingrate!
62,1,6,Stan Marsh,Good night grandpa.
63,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,You pompous son of a whore!
64,1,6,Student,"Huh huh, I had another ..."
65,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Ow! What the hell was that for?!
66,1,6,Eric Cartman,That's for your stupid mother! She made me miss Terrance & Phillip last night!
67,1,6,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah, what's the big idea having your mom call all our moms last night?"
68,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Well I didn't have her do it. She did it on her own.
69,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Why does this happen every month? It seems like, right around the same time every month, Kyle's mom gets a hair up her ass about something and I always end up getting screwed by it!"
70,1,6,Mr Garrison,Children! Children! A certain student's mother called me last night.
71,1,6,Eric Cartman,"[Tauntingly.] Oh, gee, I wonder who's mother that could have been?"
72,1,6,Mr Garrison,"She informed me that some of you might be watching a, a naughty show called Terrance & Phillip."
73,1,6,Class,"Yeahh, woohoo!"
74,1,6,Mr Hat,"Watching that show is bad, Mr. Garrison."
75,1,6,Mr Garrison,"That's right Mr. Hat, shows like Terrance & Phillip are what we call 'toilet humor.' They don't expand your minds."
76,1,6,Mr Garrison,"You see children, these kind of shows are senseless, vile trash."
77,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Kenny, why are you late to class?"
78,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Oh, okay Kenny, be seated."
79,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Now, as I was saying, the reason that parents of South Park are so upset is because..."
80,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Yes Kenny, what is it?"
81,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(I have to go pee.)
82,1,6,Mr Garrison,I thought you just came from the bathroom.
83,1,6,Kenny McCormick,"(I did, I gotta go again...)"
84,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Okay okay, go ahead."
85,1,6,Mr Garrison,"As I was saying, you all seem to enjoy this show, even though it isn't based in reality. There's much more to life than two young men farting on each other. And throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad, and usually they get taken right off the air. You see, you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment."
86,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Whoa, smells like you slaughtered a cow in there Kenny!"
87,1,6,Mr Garrison,Pay attention children!
88,1,6,Mr Garrison,"I'm going to join your parents in requesting that you don't watch Terrance & Phillip any more, ever."
89,1,6,Eric Cartman,What?
90,1,6,Clyde Donovan,Not watch Terrance & Phillip ever?
91,1,6,Mr Garrison,That's right children. Are there any questions?
92,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Yes, Stanley?"
93,1,6,Stan Marsh,Is it okay to kill somebody if they want you to?
94,1,6,Mr Garrison,"What, what do you mean?"
95,1,6,Stan Marsh,"My grandpa keeps asking that I kill him all the time, and sometimes I wonder if I should."
96,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, then you should. I think that a person has a right to die if they wanna."
97,1,6,Stan Marsh,Really??
98,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, there's this guy named Jack Leborkian that goes around and murders people that ask him to, and he doesn't get in any trouble at all."
99,1,6,Stan Marsh,Wow!
100,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, maybe we can get him to Kyle's mom!"
101,1,6,Stan Marsh,"So, is it okay to assist somebody with suicide, Mr. Garrison?"
102,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Uh, Stan, I'm not touching that one with a twenty-foot pole."
103,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(Oh my God!)
104,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(Owww!) [Splatterrrrr!]
105,1,6,Eric Cartman,Man! I can't believe we're gonna miss Terrance & Phillip today. I think I'm already having withdrawal.
106,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Don't worry dude, we can all go watch it at my house. My parents don't get home until late."
107,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,But won't your grandpa be there?
108,1,6,Stan Marsh,Yeah...
109,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Just kill 'im dude, maybe he'll give you some money."
110,1,6,Chef,Hello there children.
111,1,6,Stan Marsh,Hey Chef.
112,1,6,Chef,How's it goin'?
113,1,6,Stan Marsh,Bad.
114,1,6,Chef,Why bad?
115,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Chef, is it okay to kill your grandpa?"
116,1,6,Chef,"You can't kill my grandpa Stan, he's already passed on."
117,1,6,Stan Marsh,"No, I mean, kill my grandpa."
118,1,6,Chef,"No, I don't think that's okay Stan. In fact, I think that's illegal."
119,1,6,Stan Marsh,"See, I told you dude."
120,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he's really old, and he's just asking for help?"
121,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?"
122,1,6,Chef,I don't want to touch that with a forty foot pole.
123,1,6,Stan Marsh,What's the big deal? Why won't anybody talk about this.
124,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently. I have a clip to demonstrate exactly what I mean.
125,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, guess what?"
126,1,6,Phillip,What?
127,1,6,Terrance,Fart.
128,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Now apparently, that's supposed to be funny."
129,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Heh, heh, heh, he farted right on his head, heh heh."
130,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough. We need to boycott the entire network! All those in favor...
131,1,6,Mr Garrison,"Ohh, I think I've caught a touch of the flu from little Kenny this morning. I've got the green apple splatters."
132,1,6,Townsman,"Ha ha, green apple splatters."
133,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Uhhhh.
134,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Hi grandpa, I brought my friends over to watch TV, if that's okay."
135,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Billy, help grandpa stick this fork in the outlet."
136,1,6,Stan Marsh,"No grandpa, I'll get in trouble."
137,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Kill me, God dammit!"
138,1,6,Stan Marsh,"No, I can't even kill a deer."
139,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Well then, have one of your little friends do it. You can kill me can't ya?"
140,1,6,Eric Cartman,I would never kill somebody... not unless the piss me off.
141,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Ohh, is that a fact? Well, let me tell you something, Porky. Your mom was over here earlier, and I humped her like a little bitch."
142,1,6,Eric Cartman,What!
143,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,That's right.
144,1,6,Stan Marsh,Grandpa!
145,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"And then, I dug up your great-grandma's skeleton, and had my way with her too."
146,1,6,Eric Cartman,Hey!
147,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Choice piece of ass, your great-grandma."
148,1,6,Eric Cartman,You piece of crap! I'll kill you!
149,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,That's the spirit Tubby.
150,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on Cartman, he's just trying to get to you."
151,1,6,Eric Cartman,Don't talk about my mom like that!
152,1,6,Stan Marsh,We can go watch Terrance & Phillip in the kitchen.
153,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"I ever tell you about the time I boofed your dad, Fatso?"
154,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Ah, I can't believe that son of a bitch!"
155,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Here Cartman, have some Snacky Cakes."
156,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Oooh, Snacky Cakes, god dang."
157,1,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know what to do dude, my grandpa really wants to die."
158,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm telling you, it's okay. Maybe you should ask the Lord for guidance."
159,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, yeah!"
160,1,6,TV Announcer,"And now, back to 'Jesus and Pals' on South Park Public Access."
161,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Yea, believe in me and ye shall find peace."
162,1,6,Jesus Christ,"First caller, you're on 'Jesus and Pals'."
163,1,6,Caller,"Yeah, is this Jesus?"
164,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Yes, yes caller, you need to turn your TV down, that's why you're getting that weird feedback."
165,1,6,Caller,"Oh, sorry."
166,1,6,Caller,"Uh, this is Martin..."
167,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Martin, from Aspen Park, yes, I know."
168,1,6,Martin,How the hell'd you know that?
169,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Well, maybe because I'm the Son of God, brainiac, now, do you have a question?"
170,1,6,Martin,"Uh, yeah, uh, I have this cousin who, who cheated on the SAT's and-"
171,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Tell little Gregory that cheating is lying and lying is wrong, no matter what the circumstance."
172,1,6,Martin,"Oh, oh, okay, thanks for the advice, Jesus."
173,1,6,Jesus Christ,"Next caller, you're on the air."
174,1,6,Stan Marsh,Jesus?
175,1,6,Jesus Christ,Yes my son?
176,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Jesus, is, is it okay to kill somebody if they ask you to, because they're in a lot of pain, you know, like, assisted suicide, is that okay?"
177,1,6,Jesus Christ,My son...
178,1,6,Stan Marsh,Yes?
179,1,6,Jesus Christ,I'm not touching that with a sixty foot pole.
180,1,6,Jesus Christ,Next caller.
181,1,6,Stan Marsh,Goddammit!
182,1,6,Jesus Christ,I heard that.
183,1,6,Stan Marsh,What the hell is wrong with everybody?
184,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey you guys, Terrance & Phillip is on!"
185,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, hey, do you think we'll get in trouble for watching it?"
186,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, don't be such a butt-hole!"
187,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, just cause your mom is a stupid bitch doesn't mean the whole world has to suffer."
188,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Don't call my mom a bitch, Cartman!"
189,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Oh, biiitch."
190,1,6,Eric Cartman,Your—mom—is--a--bi-bi-bii-biittchh.
191,1,6,TV Announcer,And now back to Terrance & Phillip.
192,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, would you like to eat some beans."
193,1,6,Phillip,"Oho yeah, I love beans."
194,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, I bet I know what's coming."
195,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Billy, would you mind holding this for grandpa please?"
196,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay grandpa, okay, just get out of the way of the TV."
197,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, it looks like those beans might make me fart."
198,1,6,Phillip,"Well, don't fart on me Terrance."
199,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Dude, he's gonna fart on his head again."
200,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(Oh my God!)
201,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Hey, you're gonna miss it Kenny."
202,1,6,Phillip,"You're such an asshole, Terrance."
203,1,6,Terrance,"Haha, that I am!"
204,1,6,Kenny McCormick,(Ow!)
205,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Hurry up Kenny, you're gonna miss the fart."
206,1,6,Shelly Marsh,Jesus! What the hell are you doing?
207,1,6,Stan Marsh,"We're not watching Terrance & Phillip, I swear. I, I mean, Cartman was watching it."
208,1,6,Shelly Marsh,"No, I mean, what the hell are you doing to grandpa?!"
209,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Tug - a - little harder, Billy."
210,1,6,Stan Marsh,Aaah!!
211,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Uh, ow."
212,1,6,Shelly Marsh,You little jerk!
213,1,6,Shelly Marsh,You were trying to kill grandpa! I'm telling mom!
214,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Dammit! I was so close.
215,1,6,TV Announcer,"Four third graders from South Park, Colorado, were found trying to viciously murder an innocent grandfather."
216,1,6,Talk Show Host,"Boys, how did you get driven so far to the edge? What changed you into such demonic little bastards?"
217,1,6,Stan Marsh,"We didn't know what we were doing. We were just sitting there, watching Terrance & Phillip and..."
218,1,6,Talk Show Host,"Terrance & Phillip, aha! So it is that show that is to blame."
219,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"These boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see, and we are fed up!"
220,1,6,Crowd,Woooo!
221,1,6,Townsman,Huh? Oh god! Oh god!
222,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"We have to stop this smut from going on the air. We will march to the network and protest until our demands are met. New York, here we come!"
223,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"We are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television, for our children!"
224,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"We want more quality television, like Full House."
225,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Oh, I think you gave me the stomach flu, Mr. Garrison."
226,1,6,Mr Garrison,"No, no, it was that little Kenny bastard that gave it to me."
227,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Whoa, Mayor, you, uh, making gravy in there? Heh, heh, heh, heh."
228,1,6,Mayor McDaniels,I just had a brown baby boy.
229,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Dude, this is sweet, not having parents around."
230,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I hope they protest TV shows forever."
231,1,6,All,Whoopeee!
232,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Come here Billy, I want to show you something."
233,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Aww, do I have to?"
234,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Yes you do, you little pecker! I realized that the reason you won't kill me..."
235,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"...is because you don't understand how I feel, Billy, but now I found a way to show you what it feels like to be a grandpa."
236,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, what are you doing?!"
237,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,What are they doing in there?
238,1,6,Eric Cartman,I don't know.
239,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Now, you're about to see what it's like to be as old as me. Are you ready Billy?"
240,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Uh, I guess."
241,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay, you, you can let me out now."
242,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Not just yet.
243,1,6,Stan Marsh,Let me out grandpa!
244,1,6,Stan Marsh,"I can't take it anymore, this music is terrible, it's, it's cheesy, but lame and eerily soothing at the same time."
245,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"That's it, now you know what it feels like to be grandpa."
246,1,6,Singer,"'Gonna fly, gonna fly, gonna fly'"
247,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Eh, grandpa, I had no idea how bad it was for you. Now I understand."
248,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,So now will you kill me Billy?
249,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Sure I will grandpa, I will."
250,1,6,Liane Cartman,"Hehh, it doesn't look like our protest is working."
251,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"It'll work, it has to."
252,1,6,Townsman,Look! It's the president of the network.
253,1,6,John Warzog,"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is John Warzog, I've prepared a statement for you on behalf of the network."
254,1,6,John Warzog,Fuck you.
255,1,6,John Warzog,"Thank you ladies and gentlemen. If there are any questions, you may direct them to that brick wall over there."
256,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Hey, you will not get away with this!"
257,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"That does it, no more Mr. Nice Protesters. It's time for 'Plan B'."
258,1,6,Liane Cartman,"Ohho, Carol, where are the Porto-Potties?"
259,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Over there hon. What, you need to drop some friends off at the pool?"
260,1,6,Liane Cartman,"[Lustily.] Ohhh, yes, indeedy."
261,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Okay grandpa, all you have to do is sit there. We'll do the rest. [To Kyle.] You got the cow all tied up?"
262,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yep, all done."
263,1,6,Stan Marsh,"'Kay, come on guys."
264,1,6,Eric Cartman,Why don't we just shoot him?
265,1,6,Stan Marsh,"You dumbass Cartman, it has to look natural, or else we'll all get busted."
266,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, stupid!"
267,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"That's good Billy, a little higher now."
268,1,6,Cow,Moooo!
269,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"The network is not taking us seriously. In the past, people have had to die for what they believed in, and we are prepared to do the same. Ready?"
270,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Mr. McCormick, you shall be a martyr to us all. God Speed. We will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our children's minds. Launch!"
271,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"We will all follow suit, one by one if that's what it takes."
272,1,6,Stan Marsh,Are you ready grandpa?
273,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Does the pope crap in the woods?
274,1,6,Police Radio,"7 Mary 5, code 6 - 105 North Avenue 52."
275,1,6,Cow,Mooo!
276,1,6,Officer Barbrady,Carry on.
277,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Ok, here we go. Bye grandpa, it was nice knowing you."
278,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Uhh, cut the damn rope already!"
279,1,6,Stan Marsh,What is that?!
280,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, it, it looks like..."
281,1,6,All,Death!
282,1,6,Death,Mrrrrr!
283,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,It's about time you lazy-ass son of a whore.
284,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Come on, let's go."
285,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,What the...?
286,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Hey, he's coming towards us."
287,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Why is Death coming after us?
288,1,6,Death,Mrrr.
289,1,6,Kids,Ahhh!
290,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Aaaah, runrunruuun!"
291,1,6,Death,Mrrr.
292,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,What are we gonna do?
293,1,6,Death,Mooorrrr!
294,1,6,Newscaster,"As the day progresses, more and more South Park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the 'Toon Central building. Toon Central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show, and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors."
295,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Here Carol, I think it's your boy."
296,1,6,Sharon Marsh,"Oh thanks. What is it Stanley-hon, did you break something?"
297,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Mom! Death is here, and and he's trying to take us all away with him!"
298,1,6,Sharon Marsh,"Stanley, honey, you need to leave mommy alone, I'm doing something very, very important for your little well-being there."
299,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, but, mom!"
300,1,6,Sharon Marsh,"Here honey, talk to your father."
301,1,6,Randy Marsh,Did you turn the heat down?
302,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Dad, Death is coming!"
303,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Keep the thermostat under 70, and take care of your grandfather."
304,1,6,Death,Mrrrr!
305,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Dammit! You know, I think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on TV, and more time worrying about what's going in in their kid's lives, this world would be a much better place."
306,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, I think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter, and the sole educator of their kids."
307,1,6,Kenny McCormick,"(You know what I think? Basically, if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents' control, then what can you see? It'll stay the same because they'll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids.)"
308,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Totally dude.
309,1,6,Stan Marsh,Good point man.
310,1,6,Death,Mrrrr!
311,1,6,Stan Marsh,Ahhhh!
312,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Quick, jump through the window."
313,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Ehh, eh, ehhhh!"

316,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Come back here you pompousy son of a pansy!
317,1,6,Kids,Aaaah!
318,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,Don't let him touch you! You die if he touches you!
319,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Come over here you son of a whore!
320,1,6,Phillip,"Uhh, oh Terrance? What color is the wind?"
321,1,6,Terrance,"Hmmm, I don't know, why don't you check?"
322,1,6,Phillip,"Oh, you farted."
323,1,6,Terrance,Ohho God.
324,1,6,Terrance,"Hey Phillip, you know what my space suit smells like?"
325,1,6,Phillip,"No Terrance, why don't you tell me?"
326,1,6,Terrance,"Well, it smells like, a dirty fart!"
327,1,6,Stan Marsh,[Noticing.] Hey look!
328,1,6,Phillip,"Oh, there's one."
329,1,6,Newscaster,"Hours have passed, and still the die hard South Park parents are killing themselves in front of the 'Toon Central building, one by one. Worse yet, the stomach flu that seems to be going around is..."
330,1,6,Newscaster,"Wait, wait, I'm getting word that the president of the network is going to make a statement!"
331,1,6,Townsman,"Wait, wait."
332,1,6,John Warzog,"Ladies and gentlemen, your nazi-esque tactics of trying to stink us out with your rancid feces ... has worked."
333,1,6,John Warzog,"Therefore, today we will be officially taking Terrance & Phillip off the network and replacing it with reruns of She's the Sheriff, starring Suzanne Sommers."
334,1,6,John Warzog,"Now get away from here, and take your diarrhea with you!"
335,1,6,Townsman,"Huh, oh no!"
336,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"At last, now we can return to normality."
337,1,6,Terrance,Hey Phillip.
338,1,6,Phillip,Yes Terrance?
339,1,6,Terrance,Is there a penny stuck in my butt?
340,1,6,Phillip,"Well I don't know, Terrance, let me check."
341,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Uh oh, don't look there, Phillip, you're gonna get farted on."
342,1,6,TV Announcer,We interrupt this program to bring you loud static.
343,1,6,Death,Mrrrrr!
344,1,6,Kids,Ahhh!
345,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh my God, they killed Kenny. You Bastard!!!"
346,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Wow, I guess Death was just coming after Kenny the whole time."
347,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"Hey, you were supposed to kill me!"
348,1,6,Death,Mrrr.
349,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"That's not fair, Goddammit! My grandpa asked me to kill him and I did it."
350,1,6,Stan Marsh,Whoa!
351,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,Billllyyyy...
352,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Grandpa?
353,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,"That's right, Billy."
354,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,"My name's not Billy, grandpa. And what's wrong with you? Why do you look all haggard?"
355,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,"I asked you to kill me Billy, but I was wrong. And now I'm forced to spend eternity in limbo."
356,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,Limbo?
357,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,"I was wrong to put you in that position Billy, just like you're wrong to put Little Billy in it now. You're so obsessed with ending your life, you're not thinking about what you're doing to his. You must wait to die of natural causes."
358,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,But I've been waiting for 25 years.
359,1,6,Great Grandpa Marsh,"Let nature run its course, or else end up in limbo. Natural causes Billy, natural causes..."
360,1,6,Stan Marsh,"Come on you guys, let's go home."
361,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Here they are!
362,1,6,Randy Marsh,"Well, we did it son, we fought a battle for your well being, and won."
363,1,6,Stan Marsh,What do you mean?
364,1,6,Sharon Marsh,We got Terrance & Phillip taken off the air.
365,1,6,Eric Cartman,"You son of a bitch, your mom sucks!"
366,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,But look what they put on.
367,1,6,TV Announcer,And now back to She's the Sheriff.
368,1,6,Eric Cartman,"Ohhh, God, No!"
369,1,6,Suzanne Somers,You are the one behind all these shenanigans.
370,1,6,Dude,"Yeah, well you're the stupid ho that started it."
371,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,What did he say?
372,1,6,Suzanne Sommers,"Up yours, butt-munch."
373,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,Whatwhatwhaaat!!!
374,1,6,Sheila Broflovski,"Come on everybody, back to New York!"
375,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey Stan, now that Terrance & Phillip has been taken off the air, what are we going to do for entertainment?"
376,1,6,Stan Marsh,"I don't know. We, we could start breathing gas fumes."
377,1,6,Eric Cartman,My uncle says that smoking crack is kinda cool.
378,1,6,Kyle Broflovski,"Hey, why don't we watch some of those porno movie thingies?"
379,1,6,Stan Marsh,Cool!
380,1,6,Eric Cartman,Yeah!
381,1,6,Stan Marsh,What are you doing grandpa?
382,1,6,Grandpa Marsh,I'm planning a trip to Africa. Did you know that over 400 people are eaten naturally by lions in Africa every year?
383,1,6,Stan Marsh,That's my silly grandpa.
