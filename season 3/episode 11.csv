24,3,11,Liane Cartman,"[stands up and turns to the counter] I'm making you some lunch right now, Eric."
25,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[stops] ...But Mo-o-om, I have to get Chinpokomon dolls before everybody else does, 'cause then I'll be coo-oo-ool."
26,3,11,Liane Cartman,"Can't it wait till tomorrow, hon?"
27,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[shriek] ...But Mo-o-om, I have to get the first one, or else people won't think I'm coo-oo-ool!"
28,3,11,Liane Cartman,Alright! let's go. [heads towards the front door. Cartman follows]
29,3,11,Eric Cartman,Sweet.
30,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Everybody's gonna be sooo jealous when they see my Chinpokomon. [Liane opens the door, and both are shocked to find the store full of kids looking around and walking with Chinpokomon dolls. The class is there...]"
31,3,11,Butters,Wuh-I love Chinpokomon.
32,3,11,Girl,[amid the din] Give it to me!
33,3,11,Boy,Give it here!

35,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, god damnit! [walks in and runs into Stan]"
36,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Hey, fat ass."
37,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Hey, dick-whore. I guess you saw the commercial, too."
38,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yep. I got Roostor, Lambtron, and Shoe."
39,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Well, that's nice, but I'm gonna get a Pengin. He's the coolest. [walks to the Pengin canister and finds it empty] God damnit, there's no more Pengins! [Kenny walks over with one] Kenny, Pengin is my favorite. That's the last one. Let me have it. [starts pulling]"
40,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh uh.) [pulls back. Tug-of-war]
41,3,11,Eric Cartman,C'mon.
42,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(Nuh uh!)
43,3,11,Eric Cartman,"C'mon, Kenny. Let me ha--"
44,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(No!)
45,3,11,Eric Cartman,C'mon.
46,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(No!)
47,3,11,Eric Cartman,C'mon. Give me Pengin!
48,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(No! This is mine!)
49,3,11,Eric Cartman,C'mon!
50,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"Honestly, I don't see what they find so amusing about those things."
51,3,11,Liane Cartman,They're so strange. Where are they from?
52,3,11,Cashier,"Well, it's some new big thing from Japan. I tell you, those Japanese really know how to market to kids."
53,3,11,Ash,"[on a TV screen] I've got to collect all Chinpokomon. I've got to collect them all so I can become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master, oooh? [static]"
54,3,11,Japanese woman,"Own-ah Chinpokomon, and-ah you vill-ah have-ah happy feelings-eh. [static]"
55,3,11,Ash,I have to become Royal Crown Chinpoko Master.
56,3,11,Kids,[recite as they disperse] Must collect Chinpokomon.
57,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Okay, Kenny. I'll trade you my Chuchunezumi for your Pengin."
58,3,11,Kenny McCormick,(Fuck you!)
59,3,11,Eric Cartman,"God damnit, you're supposed to trade those, you little asshole! Give me Pengin!"
60,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[arrives] Hey dudes. [notices] What are those?
61,3,11,Stan Marsh,What are these? They're Chinpokomon!
62,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
63,3,11,Eric Cartman,[haltingly] You don't appear to have any Chinpokomon.
64,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"No, but look: I just got this sweet Cyborg Bill doll."
65,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, please. Cyborg Bill is so yesterday."
66,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, like ancient history."
67,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Cyborg Bill isn't cool anymore?
68,3,11,Stan Marsh,"No, dude!"
69,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Cyborg Bill hasn't been cool for a long time, Kyle."
70,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Why the hell don't people tell me these things?!
71,3,11,Eric Cartman,It's all Chinpokomon now.
72,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, if you collect Chinpokomon you can complete the Primary Main Objective."
73,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,What's the Primary Main Objective?
74,3,11,Eric Cartman,You don't even know what the Primary Main Objective is?
75,3,11,Stan Marsh,The Primary Main Objective is to destroy the Evil Power.
76,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, what's the Evil Power?"
77,3,11,Stan Marsh,[exasperated] Ogh..!
78,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[exasperated] Oh, my God..! The identity of the Evil Power won't be revealed until all Chinpokomon are collected by a Royal Crown Chinpoko Master!"
79,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?
80,3,11,Eric Cartman,Duhhh!
81,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, get with the times, dude. [turns and walks away with Cartman and Kenny]"
82,3,11,Eric Cartman,Duhhh!
83,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[throws down Cyborg Bill] Shit!
84,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"Yeah, I guess so."
85,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[enters] Mom, Dad, can I have money to buy Chinpokomon?"
86,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,What's a Chinpokomon?
87,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,I'm not sure.
88,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, why do you need one?"
89,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,I don't know.
90,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"...Well then, the answer is no, Kyle. You just got money to buy your Cyborg Bill doll."
91,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, but Cyborg Bill is totally gay now. Please Mom? Everybody else has Chinpokomon."
92,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"Well, Kyle, that's not a reason to buy something."
93,3,11,Ike Broflovski,Neah Kyle doh.
94,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"You see, son, fads come and go. And this ""Chin-po-ko-mon"" is obviously nothing more than a fad. You don't have to be a part of it. In fact, you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers, ""I'm not going to be a part of this fad, because I'm an individual."" Do you understand?"
95,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Yes. Yes, I do, Dad. Now let me tell you how it works in the real world. In the real world, I can either get a Chinpokomon, or I can be the only kid without one, which singles me out, and causes the other kids to make fun of me and kick my ass."
96,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,Hm... Good point; here's $10. [hands it to him]
97,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Thanks.
98,3,11,Gerald Broflovski,"Wait, here's 20. Get one for your brother, too. [Kyle receives the other $10 and walks out]"
99,3,11,Ike Broflovski,"Hey, Chih-paw-ko."
100,3,11,Cashier,"[hands him the doll] There you go, son. I honestly don't know what you see in these things."
101,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Neither do I. [turns and walks out.]
102,3,11,Cashier,[closes the door and turns off the lights] I guess I'll call it a night. [heads towards the back]
103,3,11,A voice,"Chinpoko! [the cashier turns] Buy me! Buy me! [the cashier heads for the Chinpokomon display] When will you become Royal Chinpoko Master? [the cashier gets a Lambtor and squeezes it, making a little squeak.] Hurry up and buy me. [squeeze] Down with America!"
104,3,11,Cashier,What? [squeeze]
105,3,11,Lambtron,"I love you. Let's be best friends, and destroy the capitalistic American government."
106,3,11,Cashier,What the hell is goin' on here?
107,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[enters] Hey you guys! Check out my sweet Chinpokomon doll!
108,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, please, Chinpokomon dolls are so last week."
109,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?
110,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude. Don't you know? It's all about the Chinpokomon video game now. Did you bring your special Chinpokomon game controller?"
111,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[a little lost] Huh? No.
112,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[haltingly] Oh, you didn't get a special Chinpokomon game controller. T-heh heh heh heh. Jehesus C-hrist! [Cartman presses ""START"" on game controller]"
113,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,"Chinpokomon, what is Primary Objective?"
114,3,11,Stan Kenny Cartman,To destroy the Evil Power!
115,3,11,Ash,"I've got to buy all the Chinpokomon so I can destroy the Evil Power, oooh?"
116,3,11,Stan Kenny Cartman,Oooh?
117,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Damnit! [walks out]
118,3,11,Ash,"I've got to buy them all, so first I'd better go to Hawaii and visit Pearl Harbor."
119,3,11,Japanese woman,[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! Deddy? [vanishes]
120,3,11,Ash,"Go! [""GO"" pops up, and the boys are furiously maneuvering their controllers]"
121,3,11,Kenny McCormick,"(Hey, you guys...) [the boys bomb the harbor, grunting all the while]"
122,3,11,Ash,I must buy them all! I must buy them all!
123,3,11,Stan Kenny Cartman,We must buy them all! [they finish the first round of bombing and fly away]
124,3,11,Japanese woman,[pops up] Gottai to bomb thah hahbah! [drops down. The second round begins and the bombing is more intense. Kenny begins to convulse and finally drops off the sofa. Play stops as Cartman and Stan look on with shock]
125,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, the video game gave Kenny a seizure!"
126,3,11,Eric Cartman,Cool! This game rules!
127,3,11,Cashier,"Hello-o? Ey, hello? [a monitor drops down from above]"
128,3,11,Japanese woman,[on screen] Werucome to Chinpokomon Toy Corporashon. Purease state a-name.
129,3,11,Cashier,Rr-Red Harris? I own a toy store in America?
130,3,11,Japanese woman,Purease state the puhpose-uh.
131,3,11,Red Harris,"Uh, I wanna know what the hell you people are doing with these dolls, talkin' about bringin' down American government and all? [the monitor is pulled up in a hurry, and an elevator rises from the floor. The doors open and two men walk towards him.]"
132,3,11,Taller man,"I am President Hirohito. And-ah, this is Mr. Ose."
133,3,11,Mr Ose,[nods forward] Peased to meet you.
134,3,11,President Hirohito,We unduhstand you have big concern about our fine pro-duct.
135,3,11,Red Harris,"Oh, eh-yes. Do you mind tellin' me what the hell this is about? [squeezes Lambtor]"
136,3,11,Lambtor,The American government lies to you! Join the fight for Japanese supremacy of the world! More to come. [the two men remain silent]
137,3,11,Red Harris,Well?
138,3,11,Mr Ose,Uuuh.
139,3,11,President Hirohito,"That is so sturange. [takes Lambtor from Red] I do not a-know how this could happen. But urest assured, I will make sure [glares sideways at Mr. Ose] it does not happong again!"
140,3,11,Red Harris,"Well, now, come on, I don't think that that quite satisfies my--"
141,3,11,President Hirohito,You are American?
142,3,11,Red Harris,Yes.
143,3,11,President Hirohito,[begins to gesture] Ogh! You must have very big pee-anis!
144,3,11,Red Harris,Excuse me? I was just asking you what you're up to with these toys!
145,3,11,President Hirohito,Nothing. We are very simple people. With very small penis. Mr. Ose penis is ...especially small.
146,3,11,Mr Ose,"[fakes a sob] Uh, smuh, so small."
147,3,11,President Hirohito,We cannot achieve much with so small penis. But you! Americans. Wow! Penis so big! Soo big penis!
148,3,11,Red Harris,"[flattered] Well uh, he-I guess it is a pretty good size."
149,3,11,Mr Ose,"Minata, kite kite! [""Everone, come come!"" A group of Japanese women move in, chattering] This-a man has veh-ry big penis! [the women applaud, Red grins big]"
150,3,11,Woman 1,"Take takeru o da ne? [""It's rather large, isn't it?""]"
151,3,11,Woman 2,"Hai. [""Yes.""]"
152,3,11,Mr Ose,"Uh, hoh, what an-whoa immense penis-uh!"
153,3,11,Red Harris,"Well, it certainly was nice meeting you folk, I just wanted to bring that little malfunction to your attention. Bye-bye now."
154,3,11,President Hirohito,"Good-bye. Thank you for stopping by, with your gargantuan penis. [Red walks out humming happily. After a moment Hirohito looks angrily at Mr. Ose] Dame, dame da. [""Bad, this is bad."" The women move away quickly. He slaps Mr. Ose] Naze kono chippu wa soto ni detandaba? [""How could you let this chip go out?""]"
155,3,11,Mr Ose,"Wa, wakarimasen, sachoo san. Mondai desu nee. [""I, I don't know, boss. That's the problem.""]"
156,3,11,President Hirohito,"Sekinin shoo yobe! [""You're no longer in charge!""]"
157,3,11,Mr Ose,"Hai. Hai, sachoo san. [""Yes. Yes, boss."" He bows out]"
158,3,11,Eric Cartman,I've got to buy Chinpokomon... I've got to... buy them... Must buy Chinpokomon...
159,3,11,President Hirohito,"Amerika ni, kodomo zenbu Chinpokomon motte iru. Kore kara, ""phase two"" hajimete. IKIMASHOO! [""All the children in America own Chinpokomon. We'll begin ""phase two"" there. LET'S GO!"" The soldiers set their rifles] The time has come! We will take Pearl Harbor!"
160,3,11,Randy Marsh,[walks up] What are you doing?
161,3,11,Sharon Marsh,I'm watching one of Stanley's Chinpokomon video tapes.
162,3,11,Randy Marsh,Why?
163,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"Our son loves this show, Randy, so I think it's important that we watch it to see if it's teaching him good moral values. [Randy sits]"
164,3,11,Ash,"[addressing a robot rooster] Hey, you must be Roostor! I haven't bought one of you yet, but I'll bet you can transform into Roostallion if you found Diamond Skill 7! [picks it up and squeezes]"
165,3,11,Roostor,Roo-oo-oostor! [a teen boy in black body suit emblazoned with an 8 appear]
166,3,11,Eight,"[does the following as he speaks] Hey, I'm gonna take your Roostor and put it in this bag, where it will flourish or expire, depending on fate!"
167,3,11,Ash,Hey! Is that a good idea?
168,3,11,Eight,Roostors aren't like Chuchunezumis. They haven't the heart for such endeavors.
169,3,11,Ash,Oooh? [Randy and Sharon look lost]
170,3,11,Randy Marsh,...Are those good moral values?
171,3,11,Sharon Marsh,I don't know what the hell they're talking about.
172,3,11,Ash,Lambtron! You are losing the battle of your life! [Lambtron battles Furrycat]
173,3,11,Narrator,But Lambtron's powers also give him a good chance for a new fight. Will he succeed?
174,3,11,Ash,"I am sad now, because Lambtron must be very lonely because there are so few Lambtrons in the world. Will he ever find a companion?"
175,3,11,Sharon Marsh,This doesn't make sense. Are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what?
176,3,11,Randy Marsh,"I don't know, but I suddenly kinda wanna own them all."
177,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"Randy, we can't allow our son to watch this stuff!"
178,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, it's not like it's vulgar or violent."
179,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"No, but it's incredibly stupid, and that could be worse on a child's mind than any vulgarity or violence. Remember what Battle of the Network Stars did to an entire generation."
180,3,11,Randy Marsh,"[solemnly] My God, you're right."
181,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Come on, brothers and sistersWe've all got to join togetherJoin together and give me moneySo I can buy more Chinpokomon!We've got to stop this fight and..."
182,3,11,Stan Marsh,"[arrives with Kenny] How's it goin', fat ass?"
183,3,11,Eric Cartman,I haven't made any money yet.
184,3,11,Stan Marsh,What?! You've been out here all weekend! How are we gonna raise money to get into the Chinpokomon camp?
185,3,11,Eric Cartman,Ey! I'm the one who's been standing out here with this gay guitar like a God-damned hippie all weekend! What have you two assholes done?!
186,3,11,Stan Marsh,We can't do anything. Kenny still hasn't come out of his seizure. [moves Kenny so the glazed eyes can be seen]
187,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,[rushes up with a new item] I got it! I got my Chinpokomon game controller! [Tthe others look at him and then laugh]
188,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Jesus tap dancing Christ! Get with the program, Kyle!"
189,3,11,Stan Marsh,Yeah. Nobody plays the Chinpokomon video games anymore. Now it's all about the big weekend Chinpokomon camp.
190,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Camp?
191,3,11,Eric Cartman,[sighs] The makers of Chinpokomon are going town to town and putting on a special camp to show all the Chinpoko Masters how to destroy the Evil Power.
192,3,11,Stan Marsh,You didn't know that?
193,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[quickly saving face] No, uh-I knew it! I knew it. I was just testing you guys. You just wait till I get to that Chinpokomon camp! I'm gonna be the toughest master of them all! So we'll see you there, a-ight? [turns and walks away]"
194,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Dude, did you just say ""a-ight""?"
195,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"[turns back] Yeah. You know, like Lauren Hill. A-ight?"
196,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Oh, my God, that's so yesterday!"
197,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, dude. Nobody says ""a-ight"" anymore."
198,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"What?? ""A-ight""'s not cool, either? When did that happen?"
199,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Like, eight days ago."
200,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,God damnit! [turns and hurries away]
201,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,"Hey, kids! [Furrycat appears] Only one more day till the Chinpokomon camp! [""Ash"" and ""Eight"" appear] Come early and enjoy all the Chinpoko fun! [""Chinpokomon CAMP"" is placed over Furrycat, then a violet gorilla appears]"
202,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,Chinpokomon Camp!I've got to buy a ticket!I've got to buy one! A ticket!I've got to buy buy buy!
203,3,11,Japanese woman,[pops in from the side] It'sa Satuhday anda Sunday. You can'ta wait to go! [moves out]
204,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,Chinpokomon! [the TV clicks off]
205,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"We just thought we'd bring it to everyone's attention because, honestly, we don't know how to feel."
206,3,11,Liane Cartman,"Well, I'm letting Eric go to the camp. I mean, it seems to me this Chinpokomon thing is just another harmless fad."
207,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Yeah. We told Kyle he could go if he did all his chores, and he did."
208,3,11,Randy Marsh,"[concerned] Now, I'm not sure this blatant commercialism is good for our boys."
209,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Well, you know how it is, Randy. The more we forbid them to play with Chinpokomons, the more they're gonna love them."
210,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"You're right, Sheila. I guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it."
211,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Sure. Apparently, they've been doing these camps in every city around the country; how bad can they be?"
212,3,11,Eric Cartman,Get outta the way! Move it!
213,3,11,Stan Marsh,Can you see anything? [the gorilla Chinpokomon appears onscreen]
214,3,11,Kids,Yay!!! [applause]

216,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,I've got to buy it! I've got to buy it! Chinpokomon! [the kids continue to cheer and clap. Mr. Ose takes center stage]

218,3,11,Kids,Chinpokomon is what we strive to be great at in our hearts!

220,3,11,Mr Ose,What is the Primary Main Objective?
221,3,11,Kids,To destroy the Evil Power!
222,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,...Power.
223,3,11,Mr Ose,Yesuh. Anda what is the Evil Power? [no one answers] The Evil Power is the United States gorvernment! [the three screens display the U.S. flag. The kids stay silent]

230,3,11,Eric Cartman,Is this cool or not? I can't tell.
231,3,11,Emperor Hirohito,It is again time for the Rising Sun to sit tall in the sight! One Japan! One society! [walks off. Mr. Ose claps and takes the mike]

250,3,11,Mr Garrison,"I can't take it, Mayor. You have to put an end to this Chinpoko Camp."
251,3,11,Sharon Marsh,[Randy holds her] My son hasn't made any sense in days.
252,3,11,Priest Maxi,"I tell you, Mayor, these Japanese are trying to change our American children somehow!"
253,3,11,Mayor McDaniels,"Alright, people, Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose were nice enough to stop by to talk to you. Gentlemen? [Mr. Hirohito and Mr. Ose step up]"

260,3,11,President Hirohito,You Americans have such humungous burbous penis.
261,3,11,Mr Garrison,"Well, uh-I guess that's true."
262,3,11,Mr Ose,"Oh, suh-n nice-a big penis American."
263,3,11,President Hirohito,"What can we possubruh do with such small penis? We cannot take over your city, filled witha men awith such mastodonic penis."

265,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, I guess that settles that."
266,3,11,Priest Maxi,"We're sorry we took your time, gentlemen."
267,3,11,President Hirohito,"[bowing with Mr. Ose] Oh, no. Thank you. Another chance to be in same room with big American penis. [exits]"

272,3,11,Mayor McDaniels,"O-kay, people. I know this Chinpuku Man fad is causing a lot of problems. But I think we've already found a solution."
273,3,11,Liane Cartman,You have?
274,3,11,Mayor McDaniels,Children are fickle. [thump] All we have to do is come up with a new fad. We find the next toy and turn them all onto it as soon as possible.
275,3,11,Sharon Marsh,Of course! That's a great idea!
276,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,But what toy?

352,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,How?
353,3,11,Sharon Marsh,Come on! We don't have much time! [leads the adults away]
354,3,11,Reporter,"And now, for a special announcement from the President of the United States."
355,3,11,President Bill Clinton,"[from the Oval Office] My fellow Americans, I wish to address the concerns many of us have over the growing number of Japanese military bases forming in the United States. The new Japanese emperor, Hirohito, has made our own children into fighter pilots who will soon fly to Hawaii and attack Pearl Harbor. I spoke with Mr. Hirohito this morning, and he assured me that I have a very large penis. He said it was mammoth, dinosauric, and absolutely dwarfed his penis, which, he assured me, was nearly microscopic in size. My penis, he said, was most likely one of the biggest on the planet. I applaud Mr. Hirohito in his honesty. Thank you."
356,3,11,Mr Ose,Your plane will fly autopilot to Pearl Harbor! When you arrive you will drop many bombs!
357,3,11,Kids,"Hai, sachoo-san. [""Yes, Mr. President."" The kids part to the planes. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny run into the adults]"
358,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Nan da kore? [""What's this?""]"
359,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Chinpoko ga dai-suki yoo! [""We're crazy about this Chinpoko stuff."" All the adults carry Chinpokomon now]"
360,3,11,Stan Marsh,What?
361,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Uh, we just came to support you. We love Chinpokomon, too. It's super toy, number 1!"
362,3,11,Stan Marsh,You like it?
363,3,11,Mr Garrison,You bet. I think Chinpokoman is chinpokorrific. I got Shoe.
364,3,11,Liane Cartman,"Come on, Eric. Let's try to battle your Roostor with my Donkeytron."
365,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Uh... no, that's okay, Mom."
366,3,11,President Hirohito,Whar are they doing?!
367,3,11,Mr Ose,It's a trick!
368,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey, Stan, look at my new bumper sticker. [""MY KID IS A CHINPOKOKID"" with a smiling kid's face on the left end, and a Lambtron on the right. Randy walks to it and kneels to display it] Isn't that cool?"
369,3,11,Stan Marsh,"[holding a Chuchunezumi] No. [the adults laugh, and he throws the Chuchunezumi away] Screw this, dude. [starts walking out]"
370,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Where are you going, Stan?"
371,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Huh, I don't know. Chinpokomon just doesn't seem that cool anymore. I'm gonna go kill some ants or something. [walks away]"
372,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Wait for me, I wanna get out of these stupid clothes. [follows]"
373,3,11,Other kids,Yeah. Me too! Me too. [each one tosses a Chinpokomon onto a pile and leaves the airfield. A Lambtron lands on its side and a kid steps on it. The adults cheer.]
374,3,11,President Hirohito,[grabbing his head in frustrated disbelief] Nooo!!
375,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, you were right, Sharon. The best way to make our kids not like something is to like it ourselves."
376,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"That's right. Anything we like is instantly not cool. [turns to Mr. Garrison] We know how to take them out, Mr. Garrison. Spread the word! Get on the wire to every parent around the country and tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down! [he walks over to a telegraph machine and starts spreading the word]"
377,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Hey, Mom, I'm sorry I went a little nutty with that Chinpokomon stuff. Can I have $5 to buy a football?"
378,3,11,Sharon Marsh,"You bet, Stanley! [a fighter plane has left its spot and appears before the crowd. Kyle is in the cockpit]"
379,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,Owatta Beikoku! [the adults are stunned]
380,3,11,Sheila Broflovski,"Kyle, it's over!"
381,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,But I'm gonna be Royal Crown Chinpokomon Master!
382,3,11,Stan Marsh,"[flatly] Dude, Chinpokomon isn't cool anymore."
383,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,What?
384,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, dude, that's way over. [a rat is on Kenny, trying to nibble]"
385,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you're just jealous because I'm Chinpoko Master!"
386,3,11,Stan Marsh,"No, Kyle. You see, we learned something today. This whole Chinpokomon thing happened because we all followed the group. We only liked Chinpokomon because everyone else did. And look at the damage it caused."
387,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,So now I should stop liking Chinpokoman because you all don't?
388,3,11,Stan Marsh,...Ye-eah.
389,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"But if I stop now, I'll just be going with the group again. So, to be an individual, I have to bomb Pearl Harbor. See ya. [moves forward]"
390,3,11,Stan Marsh,"Oh... Wait. [walks with the plane] Actually, I was wrong. You see, Kyle, I learned something, just now. It is good to go with the group. A group mentality is healthy, sometimes."
391,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Aw, screw it; I'm too confused. [turns the power off and hops out of the plane. Mr. Garrison walk away]"
392,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Well, I'm sure glad this is all over."
393,3,11,Eric Cartman,"[sees rats on Kenny and swats them off] Hey, get offa him! He's not dead yet!"
394,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Nnno! Get off, you stupid rats! He's not dead yet!"
395,3,11,Randy Marsh,"Hey, you guys wanna go to the toy store after school and get some Spaceman Greg cards?"
396,3,11,Kyle Broflovski,"Naw, I think I'm through with fads for a while."
397,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Me, too. [Kenny starts to tremble] I'm choosing my own toys from now on, 'cause-- [Kenny falls and trembles harder. The others watch]"
398,3,11,Stan Marsh,What the..? [Kenny's body rips open and a bunch of rats crawl out of him.]
399,3,11,Eric Cartman,"Ooooh-ho-ho-ho, gro-hoss! [Stan and Kyle laugh as Cartman looks on, the credits play the instrumental theme that played in the Wild Wacky Action Bike & Alabama Man commercials]"
400,3,11,Announcer and Singer for Commercials,(over the Braniff Airlines logo) Bye bye buh-buh-buh-buh-buh chicken!
