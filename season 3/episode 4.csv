0,3,4,Eric Cartman,"You guys, listen to this song I just wrote. It's called, ""I Hate You Guys"":
[plays four notes before each line]
I hate you guys.
You guys are assholes.
Specially Kenny.
[the other three glare at him] I hate him the most.}}
{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay now, let's try one all together:
I hate you guys. Come on, you guys know the words.
Specially Kenny."
1,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"This is sweet, being rugged outdoorsmen. [""Hey you guys, sing the song!""] Facing the wilderness, not having to be home until 8:30,... [Cartman gets up and walks away]"
2,3,4,Stan Marsh,Where are you going?
3,3,4,Eric Cartman,I'm going home for a minute. I have to go to the bathroom.
4,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Just go behind a tree.
5,3,4,Eric Cartman,I have to go number two.
6,3,4,Stan Marsh,So? You can poo in the wilderness.
7,3,4,Eric Cartman,"No way, dude! What would I wipe with?"
8,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Cartman, don't be such a baby! We're supposed to be rugged outdoorsmen!"
9,3,4,Eric Cartman,Well what do I sit on?
10,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You just squat, stupid! [Cartman begins to lower his pants...]"
11,3,4,Stan Marsh,Not here! Go further away!
12,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[moves away] God, I'm glad you guys know all these ""pooping outside"" rules! [he squats some distance away and begins] Urgh. Come on, now."
13,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Watch out for ground eels! [he, Stan and Kenny begin to laugh]"
14,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Stop, you guys! I can't think!"
15,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,What do you have to think about?
16,3,4,Eric Cartman,"I have to think about... planes dropping bombs, and dump trucks, and self-serve ice cream... [a dump is heard] Oh, that did it."
17,3,4,Stan Marsh,"Sick, dude!"
18,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Poopin' outside,
[a rear shot] Makin' self-serve ice cream
For my friends
Specially Kenny.
Hey, Kenny, Can I borrow one of your gloves?
[a yellow creature peeks out between the trees. It is the one looking at Cartman's rear.]"
19,3,4,Kenny McCormick,"(Here you go.) [begins to walk to Cartman, but realizes what it's to be used for] (No way!) [goes back to roasting his marshmallow]"
20,3,4,Eric Cartman,[hears some rustling and zips up immediately] What the?
21,3,4,Creature,[running through the trees] Oohma poota!
22,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God! Come on, you guys, come look at this!"
23,3,4,Stan Marsh,"[thinking of poo] We don't wanna look at it, Cartman!"
24,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[urging] You guys, get over here!"
25,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"No way, dude!"
26,3,4,Eric Cartman,I'm serious now! [the boys walk over to the spot] Look. Over by those bushes.
27,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,What?
28,3,4,Creature,Meesa scared!
29,3,4,Stan Marsh,I see it!
30,3,4,Eric Cartman,Come on! Let's kill it! [the boys move forward]
31,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[steps in the poo and looks at his shoe] Aw, Cartman! You're supposed to bury it!"
32,3,4,Announcer,Look at this sword. Only on House Shopping Network. It has a dragon on the blade. [close-up of the samurai sword] It's got a dragon painted right on the blade! You should buy the samurai sw-
33,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Ned, how the hell could you lose your voice box?! [Ned tries to speak] I can't hear you, Ned. You don't have a trachea. You smoked too much and you had it removed. And then you drank too much and you lost your god-damned voice box, Ned!"
34,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,[eructing] Shut... up... Jimbo.
35,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Aw, Ned, don't burp-talk. That just sicks me out."
36,3,4,Stan Marsh,[outside] I saw it this way!
37,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Over here!
38,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[trying to keep up] Come on, you guys!"
39,3,4,Jimbo Kern,[opens the door] What the hell's goin' on?!
40,3,4,Stan Marsh,"Uncle Jimbo, Cartman found a big animal creature and it ran over that way!"
41,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hold on, I'll get my shotgun! Ned! Ned, come on! [goes in, and reappears with his gun. Ned follows him out the door] Where did it go?"
42,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,It just ran by here a second ago. [rustling is heard]
43,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"[cocks the shotgun] Sounds like it ran into the ostrich trap! [all move slowly around a corner] Sshh. Now keep quiet. All right. I'm gonna turn my flashlight on. It may get startled, so be ready. [turns it on and flashes it into the trap]"
44,3,4,Creature,Ooba jaaga!
45,3,4,Jimbo Kern,Holy Crow! I've never seen anything like it!
46,3,4,Creature,Meesa gonna die? Wooo-wowoop!
47,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Heheh. Hey-heh, that thing's funny."
48,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,[annoyed] It's stupid.
49,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, let's kill it."
50,3,4,Eric Cartman,[intervening] No! No. Don't.
51,3,4,Jimbo Kern,Huh?
52,3,4,Eric Cartman,I like it.
53,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"You don't like anything, Cartman! [the creature is shaking from fright, and Cartman looks at it affectionately]"
54,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Well, all right. Ned, get the Mayor on the phone, tell her that we... hoh yeah, he can't talk. All right, never mind, I'll do it."
55,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Yeah, it was like wrestling a Louisiana alligator, this thing. Put up one hell of a fight. [the crowd murmurs and the creature just stares out of the cage. His view is that of a fish lens]"
56,3,4,Sheila,"[walks up to it] Hello there. Who's the cute baby? Who's the fuzzy, huh? Yes, that's a cutie. [three men with briefcases walk up]"
57,3,4,FED,"Mayor, we're from the Department of Interior."
58,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Ooh, yes. How are you?"
59,3,4,DOI 1,"[the one with black hair] Fine, just fine."
60,3,4,DOI 2,"[the one with red hair] Fine, just fine."
61,3,4,DOI 3,[the one with brown hair] Fine.
62,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,Right over here. [she shows them the creature and they stare in awe]
63,3,4,DOI 2,"My God, McClanahan, do you believe it? [DOI 3 is just stunned]"
64,3,4,Creature,Meesa needa Jakov. [raises its arms] Dwooooooo!
65,3,4,DOI 1,Mm-it's amazing.
66,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,What?
67,3,4,DOI 1,"Mayor, this is a jakovasaur. A live one has never been seen."
68,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Oh, neato."
69,3,4,DOI 2,Incredible. [turns to look at the Mayor] We know of this creature only from remains frozen in snow.
70,3,4,DOI 1,Do you realize what this means? We could use its DNA and have a chance of bringing the entire jakovasaur species back from extinction.
71,3,4,Eric Cartman,Wow! Cool!
72,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,[eructing] Is... there... re... ward... money? [the DOI agents look at him]
73,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Huh, cut it out, Ned! That's just disgusting!"
74,3,4,DOI 2,This one jakovasaur can mother an entire population of the animals.
75,3,4,Woman,"Well, in that case, I think we should name it... Hope."
76,3,4,Woman 2,Hope.
77,3,4,Man,"Yes, Hope."
78,3,4,Hope (Junjun),Meesa name Junjun.
79,3,4,Stan Marsh,I think his name is Junjun.
80,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Hope. Why, that's a perfectly beautiful name!"
81,3,4,DOI 1,Now we must find a safe place for it.
82,3,4,Mr Garrison,I'll keep it at my house.
83,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"No, Garrison, you'll just try to have sex with it!"
84,3,4,Junjun,Uuh?!
85,3,4,Mr Garrison,What?! How dare you say that?!
86,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"Garrison, you remember what happened to the wounded pigeon you were supposed to take care of?!"
87,3,4,Mr Garrison,"Oh, come on! You all know that pigeon was a total slut."
88,3,4,Rancher,"Oh, I got a barn it can stay in. It ain't much, but it's heated."
89,3,4,DOI 1,"Well, that sounds fine, just fine."
90,3,4,DOI 3,"Fine, just fine."
91,3,4,DOI 2,Fine.
92,3,4,Mr Garrison,"Now, wait a minute. I wanna clear the air here. We all know that pigeon was a whore. Raise your hand if you didn't sleep with that pigeon? [everyone around him raises his or her hand] Oh, whatever!"
93,3,4,Announcer,It's got a dragon painted on the blade. This is the Sumatomi sword-
94,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[wondering] Wow, a dragon right on the blade. Mom, can I get a Sumatomi sword used by the ancient Tokugawa soldiers??"
95,3,4,Liane Cartman,"[from somewhere else] I'll think about it, hon."
96,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Sweet. [someone knocks on the front door] Mom, somebody's at the door."
97,3,4,Liane Cartman,"Mommy's busy, boopie-kins."
98,3,4,Eric Cartman,Should I get it?
99,3,4,Liane Cartman,"[in bed, with torch and bong in hand] Go ahead, snookums. It's probably one of your little friends."
100,3,4,Eric Cartman,Okay.
101,3,4,Liane Cartman,"[inhales, with a manly voice] Hmmm. [two men are in bed with her. One of them is her congressman, O'Reilly]"
102,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Okay, okay, hold your horses! God! [opens the door and screams. An angry jakovasaur glares at him. Cartman backs into the living room] Mom, it's another Stark's Pond creature!"
103,3,4,Liane Cartman,"That's nice, muffin."
104,3,4,Jakovasaur,"Please help me. Whoa-oh-oh-oh. [falls on his face and gets up] Please help me find Junjun. She has been gone since last night, and I'm worried sick."
105,3,4,Eric Cartman,You mean the other jakovasaur?
106,3,4,Jakovasaur,What means a jakovasaur?
107,3,4,Eric Cartman,You're a jakovasaur; that's what they call you.
108,3,4,Jakovasaur,Oh. Cool beans.
109,3,4,Eric Cartman,But the other jakovasaur talked different.
110,3,4,Jakovasaur,That's 'cause Junjun's a girl. Girls talk different.
111,3,4,Eric Cartman,I have to call my friends over; they're never gonna believe it.
112,3,4,Jakovasaur,Please take me to Junjun. We're the last of our kind. There are only two of us left.
113,3,4,Eric Cartman,"He's the last of his kind, you guys. There's only two of them left. [the others stay silent, looking at him]"
114,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Did you smoke some of your mom's crack?
115,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Will you stop with the whole ""mom smoking crack"" thing?! It's a old joke!"
116,3,4,Jakovasaur,"[hidden] Eric, do you have any more cookies? [Cartman turns his head aside and grins]"
117,3,4,Stan Marsh,Who's that? One of your mom's boyfriends?
118,3,4,Eric Cartman,"No, that was a jakovasaur. It's okay to come in. [the closet door opens and the jakovasaur comes out]"
119,3,4,Stan Marsh,Wow!
120,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Jakov, I want you to meet my friends."
121,3,4,Jakov,"Huhello, guys. I love new friends. [trips and flies across the room, then clears his head. A rattling noise is heard]"
122,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Hahahahaheh, isn't he funny?"
123,3,4,Stan Marsh,"[put off] No, he's annoying."
124,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,What are we supposed to do with him?
125,3,4,Eric Cartman,We have to take him to that rancher's barn to see his girlfriend.
126,3,4,Stan Marsh,Why don't we just tell our parents?
127,3,4,Eric Cartman,No! Why don't you wanna to understand? We have to do this ourselves.
128,3,4,Stan Marsh,[softly] Sshh! Be quiet. We could get in big trouble for being here.
129,3,4,Jakov,[sees his mate and can't help it] Junjun!
130,3,4,Stan Marsh,"[softly, curtly] Sh! Keep quiet, stupid!"
131,3,4,Jakov,"[rushes up to her] Oh, Junjun, I'm so glad you're okay! [she's sitting on some hay]"
132,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"[softly, curtly] Dude, have you ever heard of whispering?!"
133,3,4,Jakov,"[turns around] I am whispering! [steps on a rake, whose handle smacks him on the head] Yyeow!"
134,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[laughing] Haaahahahah. You're so funny, Jakov."
135,3,4,Jakov,[soothing his head] I am?
136,3,4,Stan Marsh,"Okay, uh, Jakov, why don't you just take bunga here and go back to Stark's Pond?"
137,3,4,Jakov,"Oh, I don't know. This place is kinda nicer than Stark's Pond. [the barn doors open to show the Mayor, the rancher, and the DOI agents looking quite angry.]"
138,3,4,Junjun,"Aw, we's in big doodoo now."
139,3,4,Jakov,Uh oh.
140,3,4,Operator,"Hello, and welcome to Voice Box Express, your #1 source for voice boxes. I'm Amanda. How may I help you?"
141,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"[eructing] Yes... Hello..., um..., I... lost... my... voice... box…"
142,3,4,Amanda,Excuse me?
143,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,I... lost... my... voice... box…
144,3,4,Amanda,[after a long pause] Excuse me?
145,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"[faster, after a pause] I... lost... my... voice... box... [Jimbo enters the room and Ned hangs up]"
146,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Hey Ned, look what I bought you! A new voice box! [Ned reaches for it, but Jimbo keeps it out of reach, teasing Ned] You want it? You want it? Yeah! Do you? Yeah! You want it? All right, here you go. [hands him the box] Well, try it out!"
147,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"[crisply] Mmm. Aw, Jimbo, I can't thank you enough for the new voice box. Gmmm, now, what in the devil is this thing?"
148,3,4,Jimbo Kern,"Oh, no, I must have picked up the Irish model by mistake."
149,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"Mmm-aw, what a bloody pickle this is! Did you keep the receipt, then?"
150,3,4,Man,[barges in] You guys come quick! I've only just heard!
151,3,4,Jimbo Kern,What? What is it?
152,3,4,Man,They've found another one! They've found another jakovasaur! [silence]
153,3,4,Ned Gerblansky,"Gmmm, blimey."
154,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,[on the mic] Here with more on the status of the jakovasaurs is Department of Interior guy.
155,3,4,DOI 1,"Thank you, Mayor. [takes over] The noble jakovasaur is on the brink of extinction. And now, you, as a community, have a chance to bring them back."
156,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[reading his acceptance speech] ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."""
157,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"What are you doing, fatass?!"
158,3,4,Eric Cartman,"I'm preparing my speech for when they call me up to congratulate on me on my discovery. ""Thank you, Mayor, for this distinctive honor..."""
159,3,4,DOI 1,"...Hope and Jakov are the last of their kind. But with the help of the Mayor, we have implemented a plan to help them breed. We will give them a home and a fighting chance at survival."
160,3,4,Man,[amid much chatter] Yea for us!
161,3,4,Jakov,Thank you!
162,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,"And now, the little boy who first discovered the jakovasaurs, Eric Cartman!"
163,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[walks to the podium and speaks] Thank you, Mayor, for this honorable distinction."
164,3,4,Man 2,"Well, that's about it. Let's go."
165,3,4,Man 3,Yeah. [the crowd begins to disperse]
166,3,4,Eric Cartman,"You know, there's really only two seasons here in South Park: Winter, and July, heh heh heh. But, but um, seriously, South Park has always been a place of discovery for me... [finds himself all alone in the square] Ey, you sons of bitches! Get back here! I'm having a god-damned distinctive honor!"
167,3,4,Jakov,Wow!! It's so pretty!
168,3,4,DOI 1,"Well, Jakov, we hope this new home ""inspires"" you and Hope to uh, hm, you know... [the room falls silent]"
169,3,4,Jakov,What?
170,3,4,DOI 2,"Well, we'd love to see more jakovasaurs, so, maybe you two should uuh…"
171,3,4,Jakov,What?
172,3,4,DOI 3,Get to some business. [make a ring with the thumb and index finger of one hand and sticks the other index finger through the ring]
173,3,4,Jakov,[scratches his head] What??
174,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"They want you to have sex, God-damnit!!"
175,3,4,Jakov,Ooohh.
176,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,[as the rest leave the house] We'll just leave you two lovebirds alone.
177,3,4,Jakov,"Well, all right, then. [the Mayor closes the door]"
178,3,4,Junjun,Meesa just don't wanna!
179,3,4,Jakov,[walking out] I don't know what to do!
180,3,4,DOI 1,"Jakov, to have sex, all you need to do is, well, you know, put your... [sees there's nothing where something should be] Hmmm. [stroke his chin] I guess we don't know exactly how jakovasaurs mate."
181,3,4,DOI 2,[holds his index finger up] There is... another option.
182,3,4,Dr. Mephesto,I've managed to artificially inseminate Hope with your semen.
183,3,4,Jakov,I have seamen? Where's their boat? [imitates a fog horn] Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr! [Cartman laughs]
184,3,4,Dr. Mephesto,"Yes, yes, that's... very funny, Jakov. [Jakov stops] I... will need to examine Hope once more to see if the process worked. [sticks a syringe into Junjun's arm and draws a blood sample. Junjun reacts immediately as Mephesto goes to his microscope]"
185,3,4,Junjun,Oh-wwoooooop! Oh-wwoooooop!
186,3,4,Jakov,[adds his reaction] Arrrrr-urrrrr! Arrrrr-urrrrr!
187,3,4,Stan Marsh,God-damn!
188,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Shut up!!
189,3,4,Dr. Mephesto,"Yes! Yes, I think it worked! [Jakov and Junjun stop as Mephesto turns to face the group] You are going to be parents!"
190,3,4,DOI 3,Yeah!
191,3,4,DOI 2,We did it!
192,3,4,Jakov,Now I can be like all the other guys in South Park!
193,3,4,Stan Marsh,"[to Kyle] Dude, do we really want another one of these things hanging around?"
194,3,4,Commentator,"...and Bubby Brister is having a great first quarter! Let's see what trickery he uses here. Here's the snap, and he's down-"
195,3,4,Jakov,"Thanks for inviting me to watch the game, guys!"
196,3,4,Randy Marsh,"No problem, Jakov."
197,3,4,Commentator,To the 40-yard line!
198,3,4,Men,Yea!
199,3,4,Jakov,Go Niners! Ni-ners!
200,3,4,Gerald Broflovski,"We're rooting for the Broncos here, Jakov!"
201,3,4,Jakov,Oooops!
202,3,4,Commentator,"...to Terrell Davis! He's at the 50, the 40, the 30,... [the men are happy]"
203,3,4,Jakov,"You guys know what? [they angrily snap their heads in his directions] This one time, I was watching this rabbit, a brown rabbit-"
204,3,4,Commentator,"He breaks another tackle, and the ball is loose!"
205,3,4,Jakov,You guys know what... happened? It touched Junjun right in front of me.
206,3,4,Randy Marsh,"Hey Jakov. Uh, could you run down to the store and get some more... pretzels?"
207,3,4,Jakov,Sure. You got money?
208,3,4,Gerald Broflovski,[hands him some bills] Here- here you go. And and don't go to the store down the block. The one four miles away in Fairplay has better pretzels.
209,3,4,Jakov,"[gets up] Cool beans. [trips over the plug, knocking down the TV] Oopsie. I'll be right back. [closes the door]"
210,3,4,Mr Mackey,"Jakovasaurs kinda piss me off, mkay."
211,3,4,The Others,Yup.
212,3,4,DOI 1,Amazing! The gestation period was only four days.
213,3,4,DOI 2,"At that rate, we could repopulate the jakovasaurs in just a few years."
214,3,4,Junjun,Doe-wooop!
215,3,4,DOI 1,"Don't worry, Hope. Everything's gonna be fine, just fine."
216,3,4,DOI 3,Just fine.
217,3,4,DOI 2,Fine.
218,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, I don't wanna watch this thing have a baby."
219,3,4,Eric Cartman,"If Jakov and Hope don't have kids, their race will become extinct."
220,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,"Maybe their baby will be still-born, like Cartman was. [he and Stan laugh]"
221,3,4,Eric Cartman,"Hey! I might have been still-born, but at least I got better!"
222,3,4,DOI 2,Here we go.
223,3,4,Junjun,Doe-woooop!
224,3,4,Sheila,"[gushing] Behold, the miracle of childbirth!"
225,3,4,Junjun,Dowoop! [her water breaks and lands on everyone]
226,3,4,Kyle Broflovski,Gross!
227,3,4,Junjun,Dowoop! [a baby jakovasaur is shot out and strikes the wall. It whimpers as it drops]
228,3,4,All,Hooray!
229,3,4,DOI 3,"This is the first step in bringing the species back from the brink of extinction! [the baby jakovasaur gets up and moves around, growling]"
230,3,4,Junjun,Dowoooop! Dowoop!
231,3,4,DOI 2,Looks like there might be a second one.
232,3,4,DOI 1,Wow! That would be a great start for them. [close-up of the second baby flying out of the vagina]
233,3,4,All,Hooray! [Junjun starts pumping babies out in all directions. The adults crouch behind the sofa for cover]
234,3,4,Mayor McDaniels,She's a cannon! [seventeen babies end up in front of the wall. The lead agent walks up to them]
235,3,4,DOI 1,"Well. Ap-parently, they breed in litters."
236,3,4,Eric Cartman,"[picks up a baby and says sweetly] Aren't they cute, you guys?"
237,3,4,Stan Marsh,[to Kyle] Huh-I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
238,3,4,Junjun,Huh-owhoa-o-woop! [pumps out a second set of jakovasaurs]
239,3,4,DOI 1,Huh?! [getting out of the way] Whoa-o-whoa!
240,3,4,Mr Garrison,"Ho-okay, children, we have some new students joining us today. Let's all be warm and welcome them to our class. [the class is full of jakovasaur children]"
241,3,4,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's crowded in here."
242,3,4,Jakovasaur Boy,[sitting in front of Pip] I like school!
243,3,4,Jakovasaur Girl,Bo-woop!
244,3,4,Mr Garrison,"O-kay, so, we're just gonna stick to our normal lesson plan and start the day with history. [starts writing on the board] Now, does anyone know why Chubby Checker left the Beatles in 1972? [a jakovasaur kid in the front row raises his hand and waves it] Yes?"
245,3,4,Jakovasaur Boy,I don't know.
246,3,4,Jakovasaur Girl,Bo-woop!
247,3,4,Mr Garrison,"O-kay, is there anyone who can answer the question?"
248,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 1,[in front of Wendy] I can't.
249,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 2,Me neither.
250,3,4,Mr Garrison,"[angrily] Damnit, you don't raise your hand if you don't know!"
251,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 2,Oh.
252,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 3,O-wowo-oop! O-woo-oop!
253,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 4,Ooo! Fight! Fight! [he and another jakovasaur start to fight]
254,3,4,Jakovasaur Kid 5,"School, school! I like school! [the fighting escalates]"
