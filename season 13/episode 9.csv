0,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Alright cool, guys, gather all around. Everyone should be a witness to this. [Cartman and Craig are at a tetherball pole, and Cartman is holding the ball. Around them are a bunch of boys, most of them from the fourth grade] Alright, you ready? Now say ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" Come on, dude, ""I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me."" [the camera pulls back a bit, and Butters is seen at the top of the tetherball pole, hanging from his briefs.]"
1,13,9,Butters Stotch,"I'm a dork, and I deserve what's coming to me. [Cartman hits the ball and it wraps around the pole, finally hitting Butters on his right temple] Ow."
2,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Alright, your turn Craig."
3,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Fellas, my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb! [Craig grabs the ball]"
4,13,9,Eric Cartman,Well that's what you get for being a douchebag again Butters! You gotta take your medicine.
5,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Uyeah, I guess I deserve it."
6,13,9,Stan Marsh,"Hey heeey, what the hell are you guys picking on Butters for this time?!"
7,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Aw dude, you guys are not gonna believe this. You know what we just found out? Well it turns out that Butters, our Butters, has never kissed a girl [Craig hits the ball and it wraps around the pole until it hits Butters on the face]"
8,13,9,Butters Stotch,Uugh!
9,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,So what?
10,13,9,Butters Stotch,So what?! [the ball returns and Craig catches it] So I'm almost nine years old and anyone who hasn't kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork!
11,13,9,Craig Tucker,That's right. [steps back and hits the ball again. The ball wraps around the pole and hits Butters on the face again. Cartman laughs]
12,13,9,Clyde Donovan,"You guys, we got it! [walks up with Token] We got it. Sally Darson is selling kisses for five dollars."
13,13,9,Butters Stotch,Sellin' kisses?
14,13,9,Clyde Donovan,She hangs out behind the temp building during afternoon recess. She'll kiss any boy that pays her.
15,13,9,Butters Stotch,You mean I'm... gonna kiss a girl... today?
16,13,9,Clyde Donovan,[giving advice] So then when she sticks her tongue out you just kind of lick it with your tongue.
17,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh boy, I sure am nervous."
18,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Nothin' to be nervous about, Butters. You're finally going to become a man today."
19,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, I think you should reconsider this."
20,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Uh, how come?"
21,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, you don't want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It's supposed to be special."
22,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Oh God, why don't you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?"
23,13,9,Butters Stotch,I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!
24,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh boy... Oh jeez, oh, stay calm Butters... Eh, how was it?"
25,13,9,Francis,Pretty worth it. [walks away with a dreamy look in his eyes]
26,13,9,Jimmy Valmer,"Go ahead, Bu-Butters. Go- go get some."
27,13,9,Butters Stotch,"I'm going! [walks towards the back of the temp building] Ohh... [finds Sally and talks to her nervously] Oh, hi."
28,13,9,Sally Darson,Hey. [punches something into her cell phone and puts it away in her back pocket]
29,13,9,Butters Stotch,"So ummm yeah, ah, I was hopin' maybe I could get a kiss."
30,13,9,Sally Darson,"Okay, cool."
31,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, cool, uhhhm... umuh... okay. [puckers up and steps closer to Sally]"
32,13,9,Sally Darson,So you got money?
33,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh, money... Rrright. [reaches into his pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill, then hands it to her] There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. [smiles, but that turns into surprise when she whips out her wad of bills and adds the five dollar bill to it. She puts the wad back away]"
34,13,9,Sally Darson,"All right, you ready? [she turns to face him and puckers up. He looks at her and leans in, closing his eyes. She does not close hers. They kiss on the lips. They then separate and Butters isn't sure what to make of it]"
35,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Thank you! [turns right and walks back to the playground. As he approaches the boys, he raises his arms up and smiles]"
36,13,9,Eric Cartman,Atta boy Butters!
37,13,9,Tweek Tweak,You did it!
38,13,9,Jimmy Valmer,You're a man now! All right Butters good job!
39,13,9,Token Black,"Good job, Butters!"
40,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[thinking to himself] Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I'm a man now. [frowns, thinking of what being a man entails] Jeez, I'm gonna start havin' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin' about a career. There's gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money. [aloud, smiling] Hey, I know."
41,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin' kisses? 'Cause I know a girl that'll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!"
42,13,9,Scott Malkinson,[with a lisp] She'll kiss anybody?
43,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!"
44,13,9,Scott Malkinson,Wow. [turns and walks away] It's almost like having someone care about you. [walks back towards the playground]
45,13,9,Sally Darson,"Jeez Butters, thanks for bringing me yet another customer. Here's your two dollar cut again."
46,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[taking his cut] Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I've been thinkin', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money."
47,13,9,Sally Darson,"Oh, that'd be great, but I can't do kisses before school. I have swimming class."
48,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Aww nuts! [walks off a bit] Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?"
49,13,9,Sally Darson,What?
50,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together."
51,13,9,Sally Darson,"[walks up to him] Wow, you're right Butters. I should start expanding."
52,13,9,Butters Stotch,We could have our very own... [puts out his hands and frames an imaginary plaque] kissin' company.
53,13,9,Butters Stotch,"The next key to a successful business is ""innovation."" I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can't afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?"
54,13,9,Sally Darson,"Wow, that's a great idea, Butters."
55,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I'm thinkin' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice."
56,13,9,Megan,"[a third grader, taking notes] Got it."
57,13,9,Butters Stotch,"I got a kissing booth set up at the kids' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets [puts up a smiling sun sticker on Sally's row on the work schedule] a little sunshine, but if you don't show up for work at all, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud."
58,13,9,Sally Darson,This is gonna be great!
59,13,9,Murphy,"Sir! Sir, take a look at this. We've got rumors coming in of a possible ""prostitution company"" starting up in South Park."
60,13,9,Chief Yates,"What?! [grabs the report and leafs through it] Hohoo, not in my county!"
61,13,9,Murphy,"We've got no information on the prostitutes, don't know who they are or where they came from."
62,13,9,Chief Yates,[walks off a bit] So then we need to go after the johns. We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they're going to jail!
63,13,9,Murphy,"Sting operation, sir?"
64,13,9,Chief Yates,"[turns to face his men] We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!"
65,13,9,Chief Yates,"Hey baby, you looking for a party?"
66,13,9,Driver 2,Ha... how much are you charging?
67,13,9,Chief Yates,"Twenty for oral, fifty for half and half, anal will cost you extra."
68,13,9,Driver 2,Aww- get in. [Yates gets in and the car takes off]
69,13,9,Chief Yates,"Right here's good, sexy. [the driver stops the car] Now if you wouldn't mind handing over the twenty dollars for oral sex."
70,13,9,Driver 2,"Ok-okay. [grabs his wallet, pulls out a twenty, and hands it to Yates]"
71,13,9,Chief Yates,"All right, buddy!... Go ahead and unbutton your pants. [the driver unzips his pants] All right! Here we go. [leans down unto the driver's genitals and starting giving him head]"
72,13,9,Driver 2,"Aw... Aw yeah. Oh man oh... Ohh! Aw-aw-AWWW-aw. AW-aw. Oh, s-sorry I was so quick."
73,13,9,Chief Yates,"Oh that's all right. [leans down to get something] Nothing wrong with a-FREEZE! [whips out his gun and badge, aiming the gun at the driver] You're busted, buddy! I'm a cop!"
74,13,9,Driver 2,Awhuh! What?!
75,13,9,Chief Yates,"This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you're going to jail for soliciting prostitution. [grabs his walkie-talkie and talks into it] Got our first one, boys. I'm bringing him in for booking."
76,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,Did you guys hear what's going on? There's like four girls at the school now offering to kiss boys for money.
77,13,9,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, I heard that now even Stacey Anderson is selling kisses."
78,13,9,Kenny McCormick,"(Stacey Anderson?) [mumbles something more, pulls out his five dollar bill and walks away. Butters walks up to them from the other direction]"
79,13,9,Butters Stotch,Hey fellas. Would anyone like a coupon. We're offerin' two for one kisses today through Thursday.
80,13,9,Stan Marsh,"Butters, you're the one doing all this?"
81,13,9,Butters Stotch,Yep! I am founder and head CEO of the Butters Kissing Company. Just look at this. [pulls out his stack of bills and shows it off]
82,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Damn dude, you made all that money offa chicks?"
83,13,9,Butters Stotch,"I'm tellin' ya guys, this is the most genius idea I've ever come up with. A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees."
84,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"You didn't think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you're doing for years! You're nothin' but a common pimp! [slams his locker door shut and walks off with the other three boys]"
85,13,9,Butters Stotch,...A pimp. Huh...
86,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There's guys with kissing companies all over the country. ""The person managing all the women is known as the 'pimp,' while the working women are referred to as 'ho' or 'bitch.'"" Oh, you're a bitch, Sally. [smiles]"
87,13,9,Sally Darson,Oh. [smiles]
88,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Hey, look at this! There's about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company."
89,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[addressing the pimp] Hi there. My name is Butters. This sure is a nice convention, huh? Yeah, I'm just starting out. I really came last minute 'cause I was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp."
90,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),You? You be pimpin?
91,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, just about a week now. I have four girls at the moment, but I feel like I could be doing a better job."
92,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"Now see, you think you're a pimp, but you can't be pimpin', know what I'm sayin'? You wanna be a pimp, then you gotta learn the game. See it's all about knowin' the game."
93,13,9,Butters Stotch,What's the game?
94,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"The game is how you treat the bitches, know what I'm sayin'? Bitch gotta know when she out there, she makin' yo' muthafuckin' money, know what I'm sayin'? You got yo' main bitch, know what I'm sayin'? That be your ""bottom bitch."" That bitch rank higha than all the other bitches but she still a bitch, know what I'm sayin'?"
95,13,9,Butters Stotch,[taking notes] Yes I- I know what you are saying. You don't have to keep asking.
96,13,9,Pimp 2,"See it's all about mind control. You gotta act a punk. Any man can control a bitch's heart, but a pimp gotta control a bitch's mind, know what I'm sayin'?"
97,13,9,Butters Stotch,I know what you're saying.
98,13,9,Pimp 2,"Pimp gotta be out there every motherfuckin' day keepin' his bitches in line. Can't let 'em go shoppin', spendin' their money on stupid shit. Bitches gotta think that's your motherfuckin money, know what I'm sayin'?"
99,13,9,Butters Stotch,[getting pleased] Yeah! I believe I know what you are saying!
100,13,9,Stephen Stotch,"There you are, Butters!"
101,13,9,Butters Stotch,Hey Dad!
102,13,9,Stephen Stotch,"Butters, we heard a rumor that you might have a little girlfriend? [Linda doesn't look pleased] Sally Darson?"
103,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Aw hell Dad, I got lots of girlfriends. Sally's just my bottom bitch. [walks past his parents and up the stairs, but stops for a moment and looks at them.] Do you know what I am saying? [they're left speechless as he continues up the stairs]"
104,13,9,Driver 2,"I've got to tell you I... I don't do this kind of thing very often. You're sure you're not a cop, right?"
105,13,9,Chief Yates,"No way! Let's just get to this, baby."
106,13,9,Driver 2,Alright.
107,13,9,Chief Yates,"So, you are agreeing to have sex with me for one hundred dollars, correct?"
108,13,9,Driver 2,"Sure, I have the money right here."
109,13,9,Murphy,"[to the other officer] Remember, he's going to give us the code word to move in. Wait for the code word, ""stretch."""
110,13,9,Officer,"Code word is ""stretch,"" copy?"
111,13,9,Chief Yates,"Oh yeah, yeah, get those pants down."
112,13,9,Driver 2,"Oh, you feel good."
113,13,9,Chief Yates,"Oh, you're a nasty little fuck, aren't you? Yeah, let me see that hot penis of yours. Oh yeah, nice. Yeah, I'm ready when you are."
114,13,9,Driver 2,Oh yes. That's great. [the car begins to move up and down]
115,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, you like it?"
116,13,9,Driver 2,"Oh, I love it!"
117,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, you're a dirty fuck!"
118,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, come on! Harder! Deeper!"
119,13,9,Driver 2,Oh yeah! [the van's driver looks back to see if Murphy and the other officer are as shocked as he is] Oh yeah!
120,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, teach me a lesson, daddy!"
121,13,9,Chief Yates,Teach this little whore a lesson!
122,13,9,Driver 2,Yeah! Yeah!
123,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, that's right!"
124,13,9,Driver 2,"Awww, awwwww, awwwwoh! [the john's car stops moving] Awh. [the john sounds out of breath] Oh, oh man! [a shot of the john and Yates putting their clothes back on] Thank you! That was great."
125,13,9,Chief Yates,"Yeah, you really worked it, Daddy. You really gave my little hole quite a... [leans into him] STRETCH."
126,13,9,Murphy,"Uhhh, that, that's it. Move in! [the police van and car arrive quickly and the officers jump out]"
127,13,9,Driver 2,Oh God! It's the police!
128,13,9,Chief Yates,"[quickly whips out his badge and gun] Freeze! [takes the john out of the car and throws him against the hood] You are under arrest for soliciting prostitution! Book him, boys! [the other officers come in and cuff the john]"
129,13,9,Driver 2,Please! Please don't do this! I have a wife and kids!
130,13,9,Chief Yates,"A wife and kids. And you're out here trollin' the streets for prostitutes. You make me sick! Take him downtown, boys. I'm goin' back on the street."
131,13,9,Groundskeeper,[blows her whistle] That's it recess is over back to class.
132,13,9,Kids,[disappointed] Aaaaaaah.
133,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Boy oh boy, really great work, bitches. You all sold lots of kisses today. Except for you, Megan, I'm afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today."
134,13,9,Ashley,"So wait, you're keeping all the money now?"
135,13,9,Butters Stotch,"I just hold on to all the money, 'cause bitches can't be trusted with it. We pool all the kissing money together, see? But if you wanna buy anything, you just talk to the bottom bitch [places his left hand on Sally's right shoulder], and then the bottom bitch talks to me. Alright, see you after school! [walks away] Do you know what I am saying?"
136,13,9,Mr Garrison,"Alright children, I want you to copy down these math problems and solve them before recess."
137,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[sees an opportunity...] Yo, Bebe. Bebe yo."
138,13,9,Bebe Stevens,[bothered] What?
139,13,9,Butters Stotch,Bitch you wanna make some motherfuckin' money?
140,13,9,Bebe Stevens,[really bothered] What?!
141,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Bitch you should be doin' kisses on the playground. You can make fifty bucks a day! Buy all the purses and shoes that you've ever wanted. I'll treat you right, bitch."
142,13,9,Bebe Stevens,Shut up!
143,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh, alright then. [copies some problems down, then looks at Wendy. Softly...] Hey Wendy. Wendy! [loudly] Bitch, don't you wanna start makin' some real fuckin' money?"
144,13,9,Wendy Testaburger,Leave me alone.
145,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Why you were made for the playground, bitch. You should be out there workin'. Don't you want a new lunch box? Nice new coat? I can get all that for you, bitch."
146,13,9,Stan Marsh,Butters. Dude!
147,13,9,Butters Stotch,What?
148,13,9,Stan Marsh,You can't call my girlfriend a bitch!
149,13,9,Butters Stotch,Oh. Well all I'm sayin' the bitch should be out there workin' is all. [turns to Wendy] Whatcha doin' bitch? Just givin' kisses to Stan for free? Why you should be makin' some motherfuckin' money!
150,13,9,Wendy Testaburger,Stan!
151,13,9,Stan Marsh,"Butters, seriously, if you don't stop this I'll kick your ass!"
152,13,9,Butters Stotch,"[whips out a bill] Clyde, here's a hundred bucks. If Stan comes near me, punch him."
153,13,9,Clyde Donovan,Wow wee. [grabs the hundred]
154,13,9,Eric Cartman,"Dude, we've created a monster."
155,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Come on Wendy, you should be puttin' that mouth to work."
156,13,9,Mr Garrison,"Butters! Butters, do you have a problem?!"
157,13,9,Butters Stotch,"All these bitches are kissin' fellers, and they haven't figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin' money!"
158,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Really glad you joined the company, Annie! Now remember: you're chargin' five dollars for a kiss, two for a hug, and six for half and half. Alright bitch? Alright, how about a freebie? [she gives him a freebie] Ohwoah, [twirls around] whoopie! [walks away, leaving Annie at her new post. As he re-enters the playground, Kyle meets him]"
159,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, I really think we should talk."
160,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Sure, Kyle."
161,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, can't you see this is wrong? You've got little boys all over school spending all their lunch money on kisses. Boys shouldn't be paying for kisses. It's wrong."
162,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Kyle, every boy pays for kisses. Do you know what I am saying? If you've got a girl, and she kisses you, sooner or later you're paying for it. You've gotta take her out to lunch, take her to a movie, and then spend time listenin' to all her stupid problems. Look, look at Stan right there. [Kyle turns to see Stan, who's listening to Wendy over at the merry-go-round] He's gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin' problems 'cause she kisses him. If you ask me, that's a lot more than the five dollars my company charges."
163,13,9,Kyle Broflovski,"Butters, what's happened to you?"
164,13,9,Butters Stotch,"What happened is that I became a man! I'm sorry I'm not your little buddy anymore, but there's a time people have to grow up! [storms off, but turns once more to ask] Do you know what I am saying?! [turns and continues walking towards the main building]"
165,13,9,Frat Boy 1,"[from the third floor balcony] Alpha Tau Omega, woo!"
166,13,9,Frat Boy 2,[walks by on the street and looks up] ATOs!
167,13,9,Frat Boy 3,"Alright, ATOs, our little Kevin is twenty one today! [the other frat boys cheer] And so, Kevin, we would like to welcome you to manhood. Our gift to you. [a huge three-tiered cake is wheeled in and the music changes as Chief Yates jumps out of the cake. He begins to dance around]"
168,13,9,Frat Boys,Eewwww!
169,13,9,Singer,"Suckin' on my titties like you wanted me,
Calling me all the time like Blondie.
Check out my Chrissie behind,
It's fine all of the time.
Like sex on the beaches,
What else is in the teaches of peaches?
Huh, what?"
170,13,9,Chief Yates,"Give it to me! Come on, you sissies, I can fit more of ya! [more moaning from the frats] Yeah, you like your little stripper whore?! You like her?! FREEZE! [silence. Only the crickets are heard. Some minutes later the police swarm the frat house] Take them all to the station, for oral and anal sex with a prostitute! Half of them didn't even use a condom! [faces the frats] Don't you stupid kids know the diseases you can catch?! Hand me that evidence bag. [an officer hands him the bag, which he opens and places under his ass. He proceeds to crap into it, but when the bag is sealed, it's all white - it's all semen.]"
171,13,9,Murphy,"Sir, sssome of us are wwwondering if maybe y-you're not... taking this role a bit far?"
172,13,9,Chief Yates,"What?! No way! Nothing is more important than keeping prostitution out of our community! [his cell phone rings] Oh, hold on, that's my daddy. [answers the phone] Hey Daddy."
173,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"[at the other end of the line] Where you at, bitch? I need my bottom bitch right now."
174,13,9,Chief Yates,"Ye-yes, Daddy, I'm on my way."
175,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"I made you my bottom bitch, now you gotta take care of yo' pimp, know what I'm sayin'?"
176,13,9,Chief Yates,"Be right there. Sorry guys, my daddy needs me right now. [limps away painfully]"
177,13,9,Black Bitch,Damn bitch! Yo' pimp beat yo' ass again?
178,13,9,White Bitch,He's an asshole.
179,13,9,Black Bitch,"You know, I heard a rumor about some new pimp up in Park County. They say he's real respectful; lots of girls switching over to him."
180,13,9,White Bitch,A pimp that respects his hos? Sign my ass up. [takes a drag from her cigarette]
181,13,9,Butters Stotch,And that's... three thousand dollars today for Charise. [looks up at her over his left shoulder]
182,13,9,Charise,"Did I do good, Daddy?"
183,13,9,Butters Stotch,"REALLY great work, bitch! That is another... [looks for the right cell to place the sticker on and finds it] sunshine sticker for you."
184,13,9,Charise,"Thank you, Daddy. [kisses him on his head]"
185,13,9,Butters Stotch,[gets excited] Mmmwhoa boy!
186,13,9,Butters Stotch,"And so, I would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees, and also what kind of corporate tax I should be filing under."
187,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),And exactly what kind of business are you running?
188,13,9,Butters Stotch,It's a kissing company.
189,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),And you're making a profit?
190,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Oh sure! My black employee Charise over there, one time she made two thousand dollars, on one customer! Can you believe it? Two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller. She currently stays in a motel room, 'cause a lot of her customers see her late. [puts his hand over the right side of his mouth and whispers so Charise doesn't hear] You wouldn't believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss."
191,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),"[getting suspicious] Do you keep any record of the men getting these ""kisses""?"
192,13,9,Butters Stotch,"'Course. My bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers, specially the VIPs, like Senator Morris."
193,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),Senator Morris?
194,13,9,Butters Stotch,Sure! Senator Morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime. You know where he likes to get kissed?
195,13,9,Receptionist (Mrs. Davis),Where?
196,13,9,Butters Stotch,In a motel room. Darnedest thing. He must get sleepy.

You see I just left my pimp recently and I'm looking for a new one?"

222,13,9,Butters Stotch,"Well wait, hold on now. Why I'd never get in the way of somebody being happy. Well us pimps gotta be good. Even to each other."
223,13,9,Bishop (Keshawn),"[crying gratefully] Thanks, pimp. You done changed the game, that's what you did. [offers the ring once more] Marry me Yolanda? We'll move to a little château in Switzerland and get away from all this."

I'm gonna be leavin' the company. Well I enjoyed being your pimp and all, it's just that... when I see real love, like what those two people have, well, well it just makes me feel like a... well, like a dick. Well I may be a man now, but it doesn't mean I have the right to be earnin' money for what girls do, whether you're chargin' fellers for kisses by cash or by makin' them listen to your stupid motherfuckin' problems. Well that's your hard work. Bitches, this is your company now, so get out there, and make yourselves some motherfuckin' money!"
