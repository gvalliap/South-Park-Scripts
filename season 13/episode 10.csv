0,13,10,John Cena,"Say that again, Edge! You think you're better than me?!"
1,13,10,Edge,"Cena, your mouth has gotten you in trouble for the last time! I'm gonna shut it up for you!"
2,13,10,Spectators,Oooooooooooooooooooooo!
3,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Bust him up, Edge!"
4,13,10,Obese Woman,Kick his ass! WOO!
5,13,10,John Cena,"Oh yeah?! I've got somethin' else to tell you, Edge! I slept with Vanessa last night. [everyone boos. Vanessa, the one with the pink bra, is embarrassed and tries to hide her face]"
6,13,10,Redneck 1,"[his vest has a tag that says ""Eddie"" on it] Cena slept with Edge's girlfriend?"
7,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh my God, this is just sooo awesome!"
8,13,10,Stan Marsh,I'm having the best time!
9,13,10,Edge,"[a huge image of himself is on a massive TV screen behind him] You cheated, and took my belt from me, and now I can't hardly get work wrestling! You took muh girl AND you took my job! [all gasp]"
10,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,He took his job!
11,13,10,Redneck 2,He took his jrrr?
12,13,10,Redneck 3,"Took hid drrr! [Edge throws down the mic and prepares to attack Cena. Edge slaps Cena hard enough that Cena falls to the ground, then does a victory pose. The ladies begin to wrestle]"
13,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, sweet! [the woman in black bra pulls on the other woman's arm using her right leg as leverage, then begins pummeling her. Cena throws Edge against the ropes]"
14,13,10,Edge,"Whoa... [flies off the ropes and into Cena's clothesline, which sends him to the floor on his back.]"
15,13,10,Butters Stotch,Yes! Yehhehehes!
16,13,10,Eric Cartman,This is awesome!
17,13,10,Eric Cartman,Dude! That was so badass!
18,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wrestling is awesome!
19,13,10,Stan Marsh,This is it you guys! We know what our calling in life is now. Tomorrow we are signing up for wrestling class! [the other boys cheer this decision.]
20,13,10,Eric Cartman,The fuck is this?!
21,13,10,Stan Marsh,[a couple of seconds later] Why did they have us put on long underwear.
22,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well ah I guess in wrestling we're supposed to make our own outfit, and then wear it over this."
23,13,10,Butters Stotch,"Ohhh. Yeah, that makes sense."
24,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Alright, so did everyone settle on their wrestling names?"
25,13,10,Eric Cartman,I did. I'm the Rad Russian. [affects a fake Russian accent] I come from Russian to crush your puny capitalist heads!
26,13,10,Coach Connors,[arriving] Alright boys! I'm really glad to see we have some new recruits interested in the fine sport of wrassling.
27,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Cool!
28,13,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah!
29,13,10,Butters Stotch,Let's do this!
30,13,10,Eric Cartman,All right!
31,13,10,Coach Connors,"Now, the first thing we're gonna learn today are the fundamental wrassling holds. Let's get some volunteers. Uh why don't come over here young man? What's your name?"
32,13,10,Eric Cartman,The Rad Russian.
33,13,10,Coach Connors,What?
34,13,10,Eric Cartman,"You capitalist swine, I'll crush you!"
35,13,10,Coach Connors,"Okay uh, just go ahead and get on your hands and knees."
36,13,10,Eric Cartman,Huh?
37,13,10,Coach Connors,"Just, down on, down on the floor. [Cartman bends over a bit, unsure of how to do this, given his girth] Hands and knees. [the coach helps him out in getting into position.]"
38,13,10,Eric Cartman,Okay...
39,13,10,Coach Connors,Alright and now how about you. Your name is?
40,13,10,Butters Stotch,Triceratops!
41,13,10,Coach Connors,"Uh, all right, uh cu, come on over here. I'm gonna position you in the official wrassling starting position. [drapes Butters over Cartman] Here- we- go."
42,13,10,Eric Cartman,The fuck is this?!
43,13,10,Coach Connors,Now just reach around him here. Good.
44,13,10,Eric Cartman,Dude! Dude! DUDE! [jumps to his feet] The fuck are you doing?!
45,13,10,Coach Connors,Get back on the floor! I'm teaching the starting position of wrassling!
46,13,10,Eric Cartman,"That's not wrestling, dude, that's fucking gay!"
47,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, what are you? A child molester?"
48,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Where's all the cool costumes and jumping off ropes and stuff?!
49,13,10,Coach Connors,"Oh, not this again! Let me guess: you just went to that stupid WWE show in Denver last night!"
50,13,10,The Boys,Yeah! [all smiles]
51,13,10,Coach Connors,"Ugh. [the boys frown at this] The WWE is not wrassling! That's a bunch of fake bullcrap! How stupid are you! Real wrassling, boys, is this! [spreads his arms out to indicate the floor and their uniforms - practice, practice, practice]"
52,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Well this is fucking lame dude! Let's get the hell out of here, guys. [they all take off their headgear and walk away]"
53,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, this guy probably wants to take pictures of us naked."
54,13,10,Butters Stotch,"I got, half a mind to report, r-report you to the police, sir! [throws his headgear on the floor and walks away glaring back at the coach]"
55,13,10,Coach Connors,Rrrgh!
56,13,10,Eric Cartman,"The Wrestling Takedown Federation has several matches planned today. Alright, sooo, here's how we'll do this, guys. I'll come out to the ring first and then Jimmy, you come in and tell me you're gonna kick my ass. Then I'm gonna say ""You slept with my girlfriend,"" and I'll charge you into a head slap."
57,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,Sounds good.
58,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Then Butters, you come in as the ref all like ""No no, the fight hasn't started yet,"" and that's when Jimmy sneaks up from behind and hits me over the head with a foldaway chair."
59,13,10,Butters Stotch,Okey doke.
60,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,So is that when I t- tell you that your girlfriend is a whore?
61,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Noo, let's save the ""girlfriend is a whore"" line until after Stan headbutts Butters for trying to stop the fight again."
62,13,10,Butters Stotch,"Hmboy, wrestling sure is fun!"
63,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright are you ready to try this, guys?"
64,13,10,Stan Marsh,Yup.
65,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright, let's start wrestlin'. [the boys take their starting positions]"
66,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,I am gonna k-kick your ass!
67,13,10,Eric Cartman,"You slept with my girlfriend, Hammerclaw! [Cartman slaps him hard, and Jimmy falls. Butters intervenes.]"
68,13,10,Butters Stotch,"Hey! No! No, the fight hasn't started yet. No, bad."
69,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey! He slept with my girlfriend, referee! In my country we don't wait for a bell, miste-[Jimmy sneaks up behind him with a folding chair and smashes it into the back of his head, making him fall forward] ah!"
70,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,Your girlfriend is a whore!
71,13,10,Eric Cartman,"[whispers aloud] Wait for it, wait for the whore line."
72,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"[softly] Oh, I'm sorry."
73,13,10,Token Black,"You're gonna get it now, Hammerclaw!"
74,13,10,Stan Marsh,We'll see about that!
75,13,10,Butters Stotch,Now hold on! I am stopping the fight! [Stan headbutts him] Eoh!
76,13,10,Redneck 4,What's goin' on?
77,13,10,Redneck 5,Apparently that crippled kid slept with that Russian kid's girlfriend.
78,13,10,Redneck 4,Jeez they're so young.
79,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I'll kill you, Triceratops! You made fun of my crippled mother!"
80,13,10,Butters Stotch,"That's because your mother betrayed my mothers, Juggernaut!"
81,13,10,Stan Marsh,You don't come to this country and make fun of it!
82,13,10,Eric Cartman,And just vhat do you care about your pitiful country?!
83,13,10,Stan Marsh,I served my country! I fought for two years in Vietnam.
84,13,10,Redneck 6,"That kid was in 'Nam? Man, that's incredible!"
85,13,10,Redneck 7,Good for you for serving your country!
86,13,10,Redneck 8,"Guys, check this out! There's this little kid from the Congo, who was raised by panthers!"
87,13,10,Redneck 9,Are you serious?
88,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Just admit it, Congo! Admit that you lied about me to Irene!"
89,13,10,Token Black,I admit nothing! Maybe Irene lied to you!
90,13,10,Redneck 1,That kid in the hat is havin' sex with two different girls?
91,13,10,Redneck 11,"Naw, that little kid from the Congo lied about one of them to try and get the kid in the hat in trouble with his wife."
92,13,10,Redneck 12,They're married?
93,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"You have to forfeit the fight, Rad Russian! You cannot fight until your test results come ba-back"
94,13,10,Eric Cartman,"I might have to wait for my hepatitis test, but in the mean time, I have brought my comrade from Mexico to wrestle against you!"
95,13,10,Redneck 9,That Russian kid's got hepatitis?
96,13,10,W.T.F. Announcer,"And here he comes now, the cold-blooded wrestler from Mexico, El Pollo Loco! [Kenny, dressed as a masked luchador, comes out to mariachi fanfare and sparklers. The spectators clap and cheer him on]"
97,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"What are you doing here, El, El Pollo Loco?"
98,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(I came here to kick your ass once and for all!)
99,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Your girlfriend doesn't even like you, Stan the Man! She likes me!"
100,13,10,Stan Marsh,You have no idea what you're saying Juggernaut! Irene loves me and I'm gonna marry her!
101,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"If she wants to be with you, how about you have her tell all these people here?"
102,13,10,W.T.F. Announcer,"Uh oh, here she comes now! It's Bad Irene! [Cartman, dressed as a diva, walks out of the dressing room and towards the ring. The crowd hoots and hollers. She climbs right in and takes the mic from Stan's hand]"
103,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Let me tell you something! Let me tell you something! It's true, I love Stan the Man with all my heart, but... I want to be with Juggernaut now."
104,13,10,Stan Marsh,What?!
105,13,10,Redneck 13,No! No! What are you doing?! Stan the Man loves you!
106,13,10,Redneck 14,Don't break his heart!
107,13,10,Stan Marsh,"If you love Juggernaut, Irene, then tell him what you did two years ago! How you killed his child!"
108,13,10,Eric Cartman,It's true. I was pregnant with your child and aborted it. [the crowd boos and expresses its disapproval]
109,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Irene, no! Why?"
110,13,10,Eric Cartman,Do you know what it's like to have an abortion at seven years old? DO YOU? I've had so many abortions. I just... got addicted to them.
111,13,10,Redneck 15,"Whoa, did you hear that?"
112,13,10,Redneck 16,Shh!
113,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Irene, you said you loved me!"
114,13,10,Eric Cartman,"I'm not in love with you, I'm in love with abortions. Don't you undestand?! [screams, runs up to Stan with a steel chair, and smashes him with it, knocking him down]"
115,13,10,Spectators,Ohhhh! [Kyle runs up to Cartman and knocks him down with a flying kick] Ahhhh!
116,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"I'm telling you guys, you've got to see this. These kids ain't more than eight or nine years old an' they got more problems than you can imagine."
117,13,10,Redneck 13,"There's this one kid, he saw his father get murdered. And yesterday he finds the killer, and it's this other kid whose an ex-cop. Needless to say, he whupped his ass good."
118,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Yup, and there's this little girl, she's actually addicted to gettin' abortions. Got pregnant by nearly every boy there."
119,13,10,Redneck 17,You're shittin' me!
120,13,10,Redneck 13,"No! We're telling you these kids are fucking crazy! You gotta check it out! [the wrestling coach is sitting nearby, stewing at the conversation]"
121,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,You can watch 'em almost every afternoon. It's some of the greatest wrestlin' we ever seen.
122,13,10,Coach Connors,[rises from his seat and approaches the men at he bar] It isn't real! Don't you people understand that stuff isn't real?! None of it! How stupid are you?! [Skeeter and another bar patron look at each other]
123,13,10,Redneck 13,"[strokes his chin thoughtfully] What do you mean, it ain't real?"
124,13,10,Coach Connors,It's all made up! Fiction! Real wrassling is a serious and respectable sport! Why can't you people understand that that kind of wrestling isn't real?!
125,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"[walks up to the coach] Mister, there's a little girl out there who's had fourteen abortions, an' she ain't even ten yet. But I guess that's just [holds up two fingers on each hand in a quote gesture] ""not real"" to you! [turns and walks back to the bar, saying under his breath] Son of a bitch."
126,13,10,Coach Connors,Look look look! [whips out his iPhone to show them] THIS is wrestling. THIS. [two men are shown wrestling in Greco-Roman style. There's a lot of grunting in the match. The bar patrons watch the little screen for a few seconds]
127,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Mister, you'd better take your gay porn an' walk right out of this bar."
128,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Holy crap dude, there's a huge turnout tonight."
129,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Good thing we made those changes to the seating.
130,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Alright you guys, let's bring it in. [the boys huddle and hold hands] I think we've done a really great job and let's just keep the energy up, you know, have a good flow, and have fun out there, okay?"
131,13,10,Butters Stotch,Yeah!
132,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Let's do this! One! Two!
133,13,10,Boys,Backyard wrestling!
134,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence."
135,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don't know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I've known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents. Left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel!"
136,13,10,Redneck 13,"Gee, I didn't know his parents did that."
137,13,10,Redneck 18,Shhh.
138,13,10,Principal Victoria,"I'm very sorry, but I'm afraid we have to terminate your employment here at South Park Elementary."
139,13,10,Coach Connors,You're firing me? Why?!
140,13,10,Principal Victoria,"The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program. Wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter, like murder and abortion. [shows him the South Park Gazette, which has the headline ""Kids Wrestle with Adult Issues""]"
141,13,10,Coach Connors,"No, this isn't wrassling! THIS ISN'T WRASSLING! Principal Victoria, just let me stay on and I can teach kids what real wrassling is!"
142,13,10,Principal Victoria,"I'm sorry, the board has made up their minds."
143,13,10,Coach Connors,You can't fire me for what these kids do!
144,13,10,Principal Victoria,That isn't the only reason you're being let go.
145,13,10,Coach Connors,What do you mean?
146,13,10,Principal Victoria,"[sighs] We... found all the gay porn on your iPhone, Mr. Connors."
147,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,So I'm thinking we do the part about Jimmy's relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash Butters onto the table.
148,13,10,Token Black,"Oh! Sure, that works."
149,13,10,Eric Cartman,"[rushing in with a letter] You guys! You guys, listen to this! It's amazing!"
150,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,What dude? [the other boys gather 'round]
151,13,10,Eric Cartman,We just received a letter from the WWE.
152,13,10,Stan Marsh,From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?
153,13,10,Butters Stotch,No way!
154,13,10,Eric Cartman,"""Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling federation and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."""
155,13,10,Stan Marsh,Vince McMahon is coming to see us?
156,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"This is our shot at making it into the WWE. To be real wrestlers. [Stan and Kyle begin chanting ""Omigod!"" repeatedly]"
157,13,10,Stan Marsh,Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!..
158,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Oh my God... Oh my God...
159,13,10,Token Black,I can't believe it's him.
160,13,10,Butters Stotch,I'm freaking out...
161,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,[fans himself] Omigod! Omigod! Omigod!
162,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before."
163,13,10,Stan Marsh,Alright it's time to start the second act. Let's bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!
164,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number."
165,13,10,Redneck 19,"Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues. [a chime sounds, indicating the start of the second act]"
166,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back."
167,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do. [an elderly fan holds up a sign: ""STOP RUNNING JUGGERNAUT""] And I, again, am alone. [Stan, Butters, and Token climb into the ring behind him]"
168,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. [Kyle turns to see the other three boys]"
169,13,10,Butters Stotch,Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday! Are you going to run from that as well?
170,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"I'll fight anytime, anywhere!"
171,13,10,Redneck 2,"He don't run from fights, just from responsibilities. [Token swings a chair into the back of Kyle's head, and Kyle falls to the floor]"
172,13,10,Crowd,Oohhhhh! [Token begins to twist Kyle's arm] Boooooooo!
173,13,10,Stan Marsh,"What do I do? Juggernaut is my long lost brother. [Kenny climbs into the ring as El Pollo Loco] And yet Congo saved my life in Nam. [Kenny picks up the chair and swings it into Token, and Stan turns to see him]"
174,13,10,W.T.F. Announcer,"It's El Pollo Loco! [a section full of Mexican fans hold up a Mexican flag and two banners: ""Viva El Pollo Loco"" and ""Me Gusta El Pollo Loco""]"
175,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Thanks for coming, guys. I'm sure you're wondering why I've called you here to Sizzler."
176,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Yeah, what's this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown."
177,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking."
178,13,10,Kenny McCormick,"(Yeah, we've been talking.)"
179,13,10,Eric Cartman,"And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again."
180,13,10,Stan Marsh,Yeah?
181,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Token, Butters, Jimmy."
182,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(Yep.)
183,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,What are you talking about?
184,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Guys, let's face it: they can't wrestle for crap! I mean, every time I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Token? He has no emotion, no timing, he's the worst wrestler I've ever seen!"
185,13,10,Stan Marsh,He's right.
186,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,What?
187,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Dude, it's really hard to do your best wrestling when you're up against Token."
188,13,10,Eric Cartman,Right?
189,13,10,Stan Marsh,"And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they're okay but, they're never gonna make it as professional wrestlers."
190,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them."
191,13,10,Eric Cartman,"No dude, they're gonna hurt our chances."
192,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(They're gonna hurt our chances.)
193,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Because we all know that the new material I've written is stuff those guys can't handle, and we'll suffer from it!"
194,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,So what do we do?
195,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(We've gotta bring somebody else on.)
196,13,10,Eric Cartman,Yep. We've gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.
197,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Somebody who can do the harder stuff we've written so that Token, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts."
198,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?
199,13,10,Eric Cartman,It's simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.
200,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Number seventeen step forward, please? [a man steps forward shielding his eyes from the glare of the spotlights] You're wrestling a Muslim immigrant. You suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 9/11 attacks. Go!"
201,13,10,Number 17,"[gets into a slight crouch] You dirty Muslim bastard! I don't trust you, and I never will! Do you know how it feels to lose your parents?! No you wouldn't, you smelly brown Middle Eastern piece of sh-"
202,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Thank you! Number twenty-four? [another man steps forth as Number 17 returns to his place] You're wrestling for the right to marry Mackenzie Phillips, but just learned that she had sex with her father uh, go!"
203,13,10,Number 24,"Your father! Your own father! [slaps himself four times] I don't care if you were on drugs, you sick! Whore!"
204,13,10,Eric Cartman,Thank you. [Number 24 returns to his place]
205,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,That guy's a pretty good wrestler.
206,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(Mhm.)
207,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Yeah yeah, not bad."
208,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Let's see uh, can we get number thirty seven to step forward again. [Number 37 steps forward] We just wanna get to know you all a little better. What can you tell us about yourself?"
209,13,10,Number 37,"Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old. My father... he liked it too. Until he died. [stirring music begins to play] Sometimes I think it's 'cause of him I followed this dream. [breaks into song]

All my life, all I ever wanted was to
Beeeee a wrestler
Fiiiiighting in the ring
Winning that belt.
And so I dreamed every night that I was the
Uuuuundertaaker
Smaaaaashing skulls in
Breaking arms.
But I'm so worked up. This is something I can do.
Do I have what it takes inside?"
210,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Damn dude, that is some badass wrestling."
211,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, this guy crushes."
212,13,10,Coach Connors,"It isn't fair. All my hard work. [he's reading Saturday's Gazette, which has Vince McMahon's picture and name under the headline ""Wrestling Smackdown Brings WWE President""] I'm not going to take it anymore. [he throws the paper to the floor, gets up from the chair, and walks over to a mirror.] That wrestling show is in for a big surprise. [grabs his headgear and puts it on] I'm putting an end to this once and for all! [gets into a wrestling stance] Hyaaaaa!"
213,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,[standing on a stool by the front window] He's here! Vince McMahon is here! [the other boys arrive. An assistant opens the back door and Vince steps out and surveys the front yard.]
214,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Oowow, it's really him."
215,13,10,Stan Marsh,"He's here, Ohh my God [Kyle hops off the stool and joins Stan in the chant] Omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod o-"
216,13,10,Eric Cartman,"[preparing to dress as Irene] Alright, places everyone."
217,13,10,Eric Cartman,"[over the speakers] Welcome to this performance of Wrestling Takedown Federation: Smackdown. [An opera box has been built to accommodate McMahon. It has four seats, and an usher takes McMahon and assistant to their seats. Vince has his own personal Playbill with ""WTF"" on the cover]"
218,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Juggernaut? Juggernaut, hey, what's goin' on?"
219,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,You know what's goin' on. It's Smackdown tonight. Which means we might have to fight each other.
220,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Heyhey whoa, you shouldn't be fighting anybody. What about your cancer?"
221,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Wait a minute. Who is that?
222,13,10,Stan Marsh,"It's Triceratops, and he's with Irene. [Coach Connors sneaks up to the side of Cartman's house with a briefcase and puts his back up against the wall]"
223,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,"You aren't welcome here, Triceratops!"
224,13,10,Eric Cartman,My man can do whatever he wants.
225,13,10,Coach Connors,"Stay calm, you know what you have to do."
226,13,10,Eric Cartman,You're just gonna have to deal with that.
227,13,10,Coach Connors,For the good of real wrassling. [quickly moves away and out of sight]
228,13,10,Butters Stotch,"No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!"
229,13,10,Eric Cartman,"My body, my rights! In fact, I'm jonesing for the rush so badly, I don't think I'll make it to the clinic."
230,13,10,Stan Marsh,"No, you can't possibly mean that-!"
231,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Yes! I think maybe I'll have another abortion! Right here, right now!"
232,13,10,Crowd,Awwwww!
233,13,10,Butters Stotch,"There's someone here to wrestle you, Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he's here now!"
234,13,10,Number 37,[leaps into view in yellow tights and red boots] Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?
235,13,10,Redneck 21,He's alive!
236,13,10,Eric Cartman,You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!
237,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,What do you thnk?
238,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Irene, there's no way we could let you here, and I'd let you something informal like that."
239,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,They are decent wrestlers. We'll see how they develop their through lines in the second act. [whips out some opera glasses and puts them on]
240,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Aha! I thought I would find you here, Triceratops!"
241,13,10,Butters Stotch,Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!
242,13,10,Guard,"[catching up to the coach] Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm afraid this area is off limits"
243,13,10,Butters Stotch,[after Jimmy says something] Are you sure?
244,13,10,Coach Connors,Oh don't mind me. [puts down his briefcase] I was just about to- [quickly gets the guard to the ground and takes up the starting position of wrassling.]
245,13,10,Guard,[seems to be enjoying all the moves and grunts the coach is making] Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?
246,13,10,Eric Cartman,"O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!"
247,13,10,Stan Marsh,"When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn't mean you are one!"
248,13,10,Butters Stotch,He's closer to a panther than you'll ever be!
249,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"Lies! These are all a bunch of lies! [back to the ring. Kenny has a bloody baby doll under his left arm. A fake umbilical cord is attached to it] Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn't matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene's aborted baby!"
250,13,10,Kenny McCormick,(I can keep the baby...)
251,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw. [The coach picks up the RPGL, puts it on his shoulder, and takes aim] We can't... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!"
252,13,10,Coach Connors,"[while Cartman speaks] Only one shot. [moves his aim from the ring to the opera box] Maximum damage. [zooms in on McMahon] This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING! [fires the launcher and the rocket takes off. It goes towards the façade, but stops and drops harmlessly into the ring] NO! [Kenny picks it up. It comes back to life and takes off with him holding on. They go all over the place, but finally take off into the sky, where the grenade blows up and releases fireworks. Below, Mexican fans of El Pollo Loco hold up banners: ""Viva El Pollo Loco"" ""Me Gusta El Pollo Loco""]"
253,13,10,Fan 1,"O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!"
254,13,10,Fan 2,Bastardos! [Kenny's theme music comes up as the fireworks continue coming down. Vince and his assistant stand up and applaud the performance]
255,13,10,Coach Connors,"[coming down the bleachers towards the ring] No! No, shut up! [steps into the ring] You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling! [performs some wrestling stances and grunts, but gets booed]"
256,13,10,Redneck 22,We want some real wrestlers!
257,13,10,Coach Connors,This is just a bunch of garbage! And you are all ruining the good name of wrassling! [the boos continue] Wrassling is from ancient Greece! It's in the Olympics!
258,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,What the hell do you care?! Get off the wrestlin' mat! Boo!
259,13,10,Coach Connors,Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It's practically gone from the culture. Damn it they took my job!
260,13,10,Crowd,[suddenly confused] Huh? What?
261,13,10,Redneck 5,They took his job.
262,13,10,Redneck 23,"I know. Sshh. [the crowd falls silent, waiting for his next words]"
263,13,10,Coach Connors,"You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all ripped away from you like a babe from its mother."
264,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Oh man, they took his job?"
265,13,10,Redneck 13,They took hid-drr.
266,13,10,Coach Connors,Lost everything! Couldn't even afford to pay for my... little retriever Rex anymore! Animal Control came and got him!
267,13,10,Redneck 24,They took his dog!
268,13,10,Redneck 25,They tok hid-drr!
269,13,10,Redneck 5,Took hid-drrr!
270,13,10,Coach Connors,"I ended up on the streets, stealing! Got busted by the police and had to spent the night in jail! The other inmates, they all beat me and fractured my jaw to where I couldn't eat!"
271,13,10,Redneck 26,They broke his jaw!
272,13,10,Redneck 22,Theeyy broke his jaw!
273,13,10,Redneck 27,Brk hij-jrr! [a rooster in a cage crows]
274,13,10,Coach Connors,"So you see I have nothing left. Nothing! Not even the will to live. [He closes his eyes. The crowd takes it in, applauds, then gives him a standing ovation. He opens his eyes, surprised at the reaction. Flowers begin falling at his feet, and Vince McMahon steps into the ring to approach him]"
275,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,"Sir, that was one of the finest wrestling performances I have ever seen."
276,13,10,Coach Connors,What?
277,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,Will you not join our wrestling organization? I promise to make you our leading act.
278,13,10,Coach Connors,"You, you mean it?"
279,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,Come! I want to get you in rehearsals right away! [leaves the ring with the coach]
280,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,What?
281,13,10,Stan Marsh,Dude.
282,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Hey, what about us? Our show? [the coach is now grinning as the two men walk away]"
283,13,10,Vince McMahon and his Assistant,"Sorry boys. You are decent wrestlers, but lack the raw wrestling talent this man has."
284,13,10,The Boys,Aaaaah.
285,13,10,Eric Cartman,"This is all your fault, Kyle! You screwed up the second act!"
286,13,10,Kyle Broflovski,Me?! It was your stupid-ass writing!
287,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,Face it: Stan's crappy singing is what sssunk us!
288,13,10,Stan Marsh,"What?? [three fights break out in the ring: Cartman vs. Kyle, Jimmy vs. Stan, and Token vs. Butters]"
289,13,10,Jimmy Valmer,"You can s-, you can suck, suck my balls!"
290,13,10,Stan Marsh,"Don't go pointing fingers at me, partner! You have no idea what you're talking about, and it wasn't... [the fighting continues. The crowd gets bored of this unscripted fight]"
291,13,10,Redneck 28,What the hell's this?
292,13,10,Redneck 29,This is Goddamned fake!
293,13,10,Darryl Weathers and a whole bunch of Rednecks,"Screw this, this is just stupid. [leaves his seat. Other spectators leave their seats as the boys continue to fight in the ring]"
294,13,10,Eric Cartman,"Oh, don't start with me, Kenny!"
295,13,10,Redneck 3,FAKE!
296,13,10,Eric Cartman,Kenny! I'm-
