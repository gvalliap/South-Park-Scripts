0,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Way up in the mountains in a small little town,
The Main Street was being decorated all up and down.
People stood in long lines, sometimes waiting hours or more,
Because Christmas needs to be bought in a store.
But out in the forest, not too far away..."
1,8,14,Narrator and Singers,...The little woodland critters were also preparing for their Christmas Day.
2,8,14,Woodland Critters,"It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near.
A Woodland Critter Christmas!"
3,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The little critters worked hard as they happily sang,
And each one of them had a quite interesting name.
There was Squirrely the squirrel, Rabbity the rabbit,
Beavery the beaver, and Beary the bear.
Porcupiney the porcupine, Skunky the skunk,
Foxy the fox, and Deery the deer.
Woodpeckery the woodpecker, Mousey the mouse,
and Chickadee-y the chickadee, all made the forest their house.
And on that magical day, stumbling upon all of that,
was a surprised little boy, in a red poofball hat."
4,8,14,Stan Marsh,[walks by with a sled] What the hell?
5,8,14,Singer,"Christmastime is once a year
Every critter holds it dear
Every animal big or small
Christmas means so much to us all"
6,8,14,Rabbity,"Well, hello there. Welcome to our forest."
7,8,14,Skunky,How do you like our Christmas tree?
8,8,14,Stan Marsh,It's... nice.
9,8,14,Beavery,"Why, it's the most perfect tree in the forest! [the other cheer]"
10,8,14,Mousey,"Oh no, I see a problem."
11,8,14,Deery,"What is it, Mousey?"
12,8,14,Mousey,Our Christmas tree doesn't have a star.
13,8,14,Critters,Awww.
14,8,14,Beary,We can't have a tree with no star on it.
15,8,14,Rabbity,What are we gonna do?
16,8,14,Squirrely,"Now don't be down, y'all. Maybe our new friend can help us find a star."
17,8,14,Critters,[among other things] Can you really? Oh would you please? Could you help us?
18,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay, okay."
19,8,14,Critters,[cheering] Yay!
20,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And so, using some paper and working with glee,
the boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree."
21,8,14,Critters,Ohhhh!
22,8,14,Beary,It's the nicest star I ever saw.
23,8,14,Narrator and Singers,The little critters cheered and Beavery said with a smile...
24,8,14,Beavery,How would you like to sing and dance with us for a while?
25,8,14,Narrator and Singers,The boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said...
26,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[doesn't smile] Uh, no thanks, I'm gonna go home. [turns around, picks up the reins on his sled and walks off]"
27,8,14,Beavery,Goo- goodbye Stanny!
28,8,14,Critters,"Goodbye, Stanny! Bye! Cya! I'll buy your hat!"
29,8,14,Stan Marsh,Woof.
30,8,14,Critters,"Hi, Stanny!"
31,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh, whatta? [squeezes his eyelids shut]"
32,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"His friends were all there! What a wonderful surprise!
The little boy smiled with joy in his eyes!"
33,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[irritated, grabs his clock] What time is it?!"
34,8,14,Squirrely,"You aren't gonna believe what happened, Stanny. It's the most magical Christmas gift ever!"
35,8,14,Skunky,Porcupiney is pregnant!
36,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[sighs] You guys, I have to go to school tomorrow."
37,8,14,Mousey,I deduce the man-boy doesn't understand the seriousness of the fertilization.
38,8,14,Deery,"Porcupiney is a virgin, Stanny. Her conception was immaculate."
39,8,14,Foxy,She's gonna give birth to our Lord and Savior.
40,8,14,Stan Marsh,...What?
41,8,14,Porcupiney,It has been foretold unto me that I would give birth on Christmas Day.
42,8,14,Mousey,So soon!
43,8,14,Skunky,How delightful!

46,8,14,Squirrely,[hops onto Stan's bed] There's just one problem: We don't have a manger for our Savior to be born in.
47,8,14,Critters,Awwww.
48,8,14,Beary,But we got to have a manger.
49,8,14,Rabbity,"Can you do it, Stan. Can you build us a manger? Huh?"
50,8,14,Critters,(Cheers)
51,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"""Of course I'll build you a little manger!"" the little boy cried,
and he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side!"
52,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And out in the woods the boy steamed right ahead,
making a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head,"
53,8,14,Rabbity,"Gee whiz, if it isn't the nicest manger I ever saw."
54,8,14,Mousey,"I deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place, for the Son of our Lord."
55,8,14,Raccoony,Does this mean we can go to sleep now?

The time that's only once a year.
We can hardly wait, 'cause it's so near --"
60,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[as they sing] All right, I'm going now. [He ambles off. A roar is heard nearby. All stop and look. The critters scream.]"
61,8,14,Critters,"The mountain lion! Hide! [They scatter, leaving Stan to face the lion alone. The lion peers out from behind a tree.]"
62,8,14,Stan Marsh,Go away! Shoo! [The lion moves off and the critters return.]
63,8,14,Squirrely,Is it gone?
64,8,14,Mousey,I deduce it is.
65,8,14,Skunky,[behind a low tree] I'm not c-c-comin' out.
66,8,14,Foxy,"Well, this is the end. The mountain lion obviously knows Porcupiney is pregnant, and he's gonna kill it again."
67,8,14,Stan Marsh,Again?
68,8,14,Squirrely,Every Christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the Son of our Lord.
69,8,14,Porcupiney,"Oh dear, I'm so very afraid."
70,8,14,Beavery,[climbs onto a stump and sits up] Let's face it. The mountain lion will never let our Savior be born.
71,8,14,Critters,Awwww! [some of them sob]
72,8,14,Squirrely,"Hey, we shouldn't be upset this Christmas. We've got Stanny!"
73,8,14,Raccoony,"Of course! Stanny can do anything! If he can build a manger, he can stop that mean ol' mountain lion!"
74,8,14,Porcupiney,Christmas is saved! [the critters cheer]
75,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"High up in the forest on a dark, craggy peak,
the horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weak.
For the critters to be saved, someone had to stop that nasty old cat..."
76,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Goddammit, this is fucking ridiculous!"
77,8,14,Narrator and Singers,Said the little boy in the red poofball hat.
78,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Killing a mountain lion was no easy task,
But he thought of a plan, and he thought of it fast."
79,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[gesturing] Grrr! Grrr! Come on out! [The lion is heard roaring from inside the cave, and it roars. It approaches the entrance.] Come on, critter killer! Your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over! Rawrrrrr! [Anticipating the lion's leap, he runs off. The lion lunges at him, but misses. Stan moves to the side of the peak and turns, gesturing.] Rawrrrrr! [Stan runs up the side of the peak, and the lion follows. Stan reaches the peak and turns to face the lion. The lion lunges at Stan again. Stan drops out of the way and the lion goes over the peak and onto its death below, at the cave entrance.]"
80,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"In a flash, it was over! A victorious blow!
The mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below."
81,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay, there. [three lion cubs approach the entrance]"
82,8,14,Lion Cub 1,"Mommy? Mommy! [they rush up to her body] W... wake up, Mommy, wake up!"
83,8,14,Lion Cub 2,"Don't leave us, Mommy. [Stan realizes that this dangerous mountain lion was a mom, so his jaw drops. The pale cub approaches him.] Man-boy, why? Why did you kill our mommy? Why?"
84,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[at a loss for words] I... the... critters. Their... bir-birth of a Savior? [The cubs snuggle close to their mom's body, sobbing.]"
85,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The tiny cubs all gathered together and cried,
All alone in the world because their mother had died."
86,8,14,Stan Marsh,[turns away and squeezes his eyes shut] Aw- awww!
87,8,14,Porcupiney,[feeling a kick] Oooo.
88,8,14,Beary,"You all right, Lady Porcupiney?"
89,8,14,Porcupiney,"Oh yes, just felt a little kick is all."
90,8,14,Beavery,"Well, it's been much too long now. Uh I'm afraid our helpful friend Stanny must be very dead."
91,8,14,Foxy,"Yep, the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole."
92,8,14,Rabbity,I guess that means our Savior is gonna be made into Savior stew.
93,8,14,Critters,Awwww.
94,8,14,Chickadee y,"[flitting straight up into the air] Wait a minute, look! [the animals turn to see Stan approaching them]"
95,8,14,Critters,Stanny! [they gather in front of him]
96,8,14,Mousey,"Stanny, you're alive."
97,8,14,Beary,"But, does that mean you killed the mountain lion?"
98,8,14,Stan Marsh,It's dead.
99,8,14,Deery,For real and for true?
100,8,14,Beavery,Are you sure?
101,8,14,Stan Marsh,I'm sure. It won't be hurting you anymore.
102,8,14,Squirrely,He did it! Now our Critter Christmas can finally happen! Hail Satan!
103,8,14,Critters,Hail Satan!
104,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Wait, wha-what?"
105,8,14,Beavery,"You've done us a huge favor, Stanny! Without the mountain lion around, the Lady Porcupiney can give birth to the Antichrist!"
106,8,14,Critters,Yaaay!! [they head over to the manger]
107,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Wai-wait, the Antichrist?? You said she was giving birth to your savior!"
108,8,14,Squirrely,"Yeah, to the Son of our Lord, Satan, Prince of Darkness."
109,8,14,Stan Marsh,But I thought you meant the Son of God!
110,8,14,Deery,"Well, think about it: You really think God would have sex with a porcupine?"
111,8,14,Chickadee y,"No way! Only Satan, Prince of Darkness and King of all Evil would do that! Yay!"
112,8,14,Foxy,This just calls for a celebration! Let's sacrifice Rabbity and eat his flesh!
113,8,14,Rabbity,Yay! Sacrifice me to the Devil!
114,8,14,Chickadee y,Drink his blood! Drink his blood!
115,8,14,Squirrely,[jumps into a puddle of blood] Blood orgy!
116,8,14,Critters,"Yay, blood orgy! Blood orgy, yay!"
117,8,14,Critters,"What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas."
118,8,14,Squirrely,[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
119,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"In the gentle forest clearing on Christmas Eve morn,
The little forest critters prepared for the Antichrist to be born.
The noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years past,
But now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassed.
And meanwhile, three lion cubs were crying away.
For them, there would certainly be no Christmas Day.
And soon the forest would suffer from the offspring Satan begat.
All of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat."
120,8,14,Stan Marsh,Ugh.
121,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Now that he'd killed the noble lion queen,
there was nobody to stop the Apocalypse, it seemed."
122,8,14,Stan Marsh,Uuugh!
123,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"""I know!"" he said with a new happy grin,
""I'll go back to the forest and speak with those critters again!"""
124,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[waves the narrator away and leaves his desk] No, no-no-no."
125,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"He ran out the living room, turned out the light,
and went back to the forest to set everything right!
[Stan enters the living room, hops on the sofa, and turns on the TV. ""The Jeffersons"" theme song is heard. He turns the volume up to drown out the narrator, but to no avail.]
But his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did flee... He thought he could hide from his problems - not true!
[Stan rolls his eyes]
He knew in his heart the thing he had to do!"
126,8,14,Stan Marsh,Leave me alone!!
127,8,14,Narrator and Singers,He knew that only by going to the forest could he --
128,8,14,Stan Marsh,"All right, all right, all right! God! [He turns off the TV, hops off the sofa and walks out the door, leaving the remote control on the floor.]"
129,8,14,Beavery,"[looks around] Hey, look everyone! It's our old pal, Stanny. [the other critters turn and look]"

132,8,14,Squirrely,"The Great Satan has commanded that when the Antichrist is born, we must find a human host body to transfer it into."
133,8,14,Chickadee y,That way he could take over the whole world! The whole world!
134,8,14,Mousey,The human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against Christ.
135,8,14,Beavery,We figured you'd be perfect!
136,8,14,Critters,Yay!
137,8,14,Stan Marsh,I'm not a heathen! I was baptized and my family's Christian!
138,8,14,Critters,Awwwww.
139,8,14,Beary,But we got to have a human host body for the Antichrist.
140,8,14,Deery,"Oh dear, maybe we won't have a critter C-Christmas after all."
141,8,14,Squirrely,"Now don't be down, y'all. Stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human."
142,8,14,Chickadee y,"Will you really, Stanny?"
143,8,14,Stan Marsh,No! I'm not doing you anymore favors and I'm not letting you give birth to the Antichrist! [walks off] I came here to put a stop to all this!
144,8,14,Beavery,To stop us?
145,8,14,Beary,"But gee whiz, Stan, if you try to stop us, we'd have to use our evil Satanic powers on ya."
146,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Right, whatever. [turns around] I'm taking down the manger I built. [Beary's eyes turn red and brighten. A wall of hellfire appears before Stan.] Ah! [The wall gets higher.] Aaaah! [All the critters' eyes are flashing a bright red. Black crows swoop down and attack Stan.] Aagh! Aaaahh! [A two-headed demon dog appears snarling at him; he runs off in terror.] AAAAAAAH! AAAAAAAH! [The critters' eyes revert back to normal.]"
147,8,14,Beary,Oh boy! Our Satanic powers sure did the trick!
148,8,14,Chickadee y,Our powers get stronger every day! Get stronger every day!
149,8,14,Squirrely,"Sorry Stanny, but you see, nothing can stop the birth of the Antichrist, except for a mountain lion."
150,8,14,Skunky,And you got rid of her.
151,8,14,Critters,Yay!
152,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The boy shook with anger! He broke a sweat and fell ill.
Then he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill!"
153,8,14,Stan Marsh,Oh yeah.
154,8,14,Stan Marsh,Hello? Anybody in there? [the three cubs appear at the entrance of the cave]
155,8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Oh no, it's the man-boy who killed Mommy!"
156,8,14,Lion Cub 1,He's come to kill us now!
157,8,14,Lion Cub 2,It's okay. I died inside when Mommy was killed anyways.
158,8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Yeah, better this than the slow death we'd face without a mother around."
159,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Look, I'm sorry I killed your mom. The, the squirrel told me she was evil."
160,8,14,Lion Cub 1,"You got tricked by a squirrel? Gee, you're not too smart, are you, mister?"
161,8,14,Stan Marsh,"I'm trying to make this all right again, but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion!"
162,8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Yeah, and you killed her."
163,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Well, you're mountain lions."
164,8,14,Lion Cub 2,"Us? No, we're just kids. We still have our baby teeth."
165,8,14,Lion Cub 1,And our baby claws.
166,8,14,Lion Cub 3,And a dead mom.
167,8,14,Stan Marsh,There still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupine's baby.
168,8,14,Lion Cub 3,What? You mean like in an abortion?
169,8,14,Lion Cub 2,Yeah. An abortion. That can work.
170,8,14,Lion Cub 1,"But, we don't know how to give abortions."
171,8,14,Lion Cub 3,"Do you know some place we can learn, mister?"
172,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"""Where can they learn that?"" the boy said with a frown.
""I know! The abortion clinic just outside of town."""
173,8,14,Stan Marsh,[cross] What?!
174,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"So he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormed.
And took them to where abortions are performed."
175,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No, he didn't."
176,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Yes, he did."
177,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No, he didn't!"
178,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Yes, he did."
179,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No, he didn't!"
180,8,14,Narrator and Singers,Yes... he... [Next scene has Stan holding the cubs at the abortion clinic as the doctor there prepares to abort a baby.] did!
181,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Oh, Goddammit! [the doctor and patient are startled]"
182,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Said the boy in the red poofball hat! ""We've made it already, little cubs! Fancy that!"""
183,8,14,Abortion Doctor,"[walks over] Excuse me, what are you doing here?!"
184,8,14,Narrator and Singers,The abortion doctor inquired.
185,8,14,Abortion Doctor,"If you wanna be in the OR, a pass is required!"
186,8,14,Stan Marsh,"I don't know, I- I'm supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something, I... I know, it's ridiculous."
187,8,14,Abortion Doctor,"Well, you're in luck, I'm happy to inform!
It's only three days until Christmas, so I have lots of abortions to perform!
Gather around my table, cute little lions,
I'll teach you to do abortions without even tryin'!"
188,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair base,
And all day watched abortion after abortion take place."
189,8,14,Singer,"Christmas time is once a year.
Every critter holds it dear.
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means so much to us all.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
And it happens once a year.
It's once a year, it's Christmastime!
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year."
190,8,14,Stan Marsh,"This better have a point, dude. This really better have a point."
191,8,14,Critters,"It's almost time when the time is here,
The time that's only once a year."
192,8,14,Beary,Oh look. That little feller is all alone.
193,8,14,Skunky,"Gee, he looks sad. [Kyle is seen kneeling next to his sled, looking sad.]"
194,8,14,Critters,Hi there!
195,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,[gets up and turns around] What the hell?
196,8,14,Beavery,How come you're all alone on Christmas Eve.
197,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,My... family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
198,8,14,Raccoony,"Aww, but why?"
199,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Well, because, we don't really... believe in Jesus."
200,8,14,Critters,[cheering] Yay!
201,8,14,Beary,But does that mean you aren't baptized?
202,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,No. I'm Jewish.
203,8,14,Critters,[exulting] Yay! Yay! [they gather around Kyle]
204,8,14,Beavery,You've got to come with us!
205,8,14,Deery,You're perfect! Just pu-perfect!
206,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,Huh?
207,8,14,Critters,[taking him away] Yay! Woohoo! Woohoohoo!
208,8,14,Critters,"What special time and special day,
It's Woodland Critter Christmas."
209,8,14,Squirrely,[a circular window opens and he pops up] Hail Satan.
210,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"'Twas the night before Christmas, and above the woods, way up high,
a new bright shiny star hung in the sky.
For the world to be saved there was only one shot,
A little boy with three clubs and an abortion plot."
211,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Okay, come on, the critters are over this way. You mountain lions ready to stop the Antichrist from being born?"
212,8,14,Lion Cub 3,Sure. We know how to give abortions now.
213,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"He arrived at the critter forest ready to fight,
but then gasped when he saw a most dreadful sight."
214,8,14,Beavery,"Gosh, we did it!"
215,8,14,Squirrely,"The critter Antichrist is born, bringin' a thousand years of darkness to the forest. [The Antichrist growls and throws little fits.]"
216,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The Antichrist had been born, sealing the world's fate.
The boy in the red poofball hat... was too late."
217,8,14,Stan Marsh,Too late?! The hell is that?!
218,8,14,Beavery,"Oh. Hiya, Stanny!"
219,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[now tied to the altar, frightened] Stan! Stan, what the hell is going on?!"
220,8,14,Stan Marsh,"It's Critter Christmas, dude! It sucks ass!"
221,8,14,Skunky,Now all we have to do is put the Antichrist into our human host.
222,8,14,Critters,Let's go! All right! Woohoo!
223,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[turns to the lion cubs] That's it?! Ten thousand years of darkness and I don't even have a Merry Christmas?! [Skunky, Squirrely, Beary, and Chickadee-y walk over to get Kyle. Santa's sleigh appears in the sky.]"
224,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"When up in the sky the sound of sleigh bells were heard,
And a jolly red sleigh flew down to the earth like a bird!"
225,8,14,Beavery,"Wow, look, there's Santy Claus!"
226,8,14,Critters,[cheering] Yay!
227,8,14,Raccoony,Let's eat his flesh! [the sleigh lands and rolls to a stop]
228,8,14,Santa Claus,"[hops out] All right, what the hell is going on?! Why is there a red star glowing in the sky?!"
229,8,14,Raccoony,"We finally did it, Santa! We brought forth the Antichrist with help from our good friend, Stanny."
230,8,14,Skunky,Death and pain await all living things.
231,8,14,Santa Claus,"Little boy, you should be ashamed!"
232,8,14,Stan Marsh,"I mean, I didn't mean to help them, I... I tried to stop them!"
233,8,14,Santa Claus,"Well good going, stupid! There's only one way to stop devil-worshiping critters! [He reaches back and whips out a long shotgun. He fires, and the top half of Beavery's head is gone.]"
234,8,14,Critters,"Aaaaah! [They scatter. Santa fires again, and Deery goes down. Two more shots and the tops of Raccoony's and Skunky's heads come off.]"
235,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Dude, what the- ? [Squirrely activates his demon power with the red glow from his eyes and a wall of hellfire appears before Santa.]"
236,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"Hold steady, Santa."
237,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[goes to untie Kyle from the altar] Come on, dude. [Santa continues firing at the remaining critters. Porcupiney is blown apart, then Foxy.]"
238,8,14,Beary,"Gee whiz, Santa, you're not gonna kill me, are you- [His head is blown off and he goes down.]"
239,8,14,Dark Cub,"But Santa, what do we do about the Antichrist? [Stan and Kyle join Santa and the cubs.]"
240,8,14,Santa Claus,"Don't worry, boys. The Antichrist cannot survive without a human host body to go into."
241,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[looks down] No. [walks towards the manger] No, I want to have the Antichrist inside me!"
242,8,14,Stan Marsh,What?! Kyle?!
243,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[now in the manger, behind the trough] With his power, I can finally make the earth a better place for the Jews!"
244,8,14,Santa Claus,"Don't do it, Kyle! [Grinning evilly, Kyle holds the little Antichrist in his left hand. A glow emanates from the Antichrist and its spirit floats out of its body and into Kyle's chest.]"
245,8,14,Stan Marsh,Dude!
246,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[returns to the altar, climbs up, and exults] Yes, yes! Now the Jews shall take control of Christmas once and for all! HAHA! HAAA!!"
247,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[voice-over] Oh, stop it, Cartman! [the spell is broken]"
248,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,Just stop it! That's enough! You aren't reading another sentence of your stupid story!
249,8,14,Eric Cartman,"I don't believe anyone interrupted you when you read your Christmas story aloud, Kyle. [behind him on the board is written ""Write Your Own Christmas Story Day""]"
250,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,This whole time your stupid story was just a way to rip on me for being Jewish at Christmas again!
251,8,14,Eric Cartman,"Mr. Garrison, could you do something, please?"
252,8,14,Mr Garrison,"Sorry, Eric, but if Kyle feels discriminated against, you'll have to stop or else I'll get a call from his mother."
253,8,14,Eric Cartman,"[closes his booklet] All right, fine! Forget it! [He drops off the stool and heads for his desk.]"
254,8,14,Butters Stotch,"Well but, but what happened?"
255,8,14,Token Black,Yeah. Did Kyle bring a thousand years of darkness or not?
256,8,14,Clyde Donovan,What happens to the lion cubs?
257,8,14,Eric Cartman,"Well, I guess we'll never know, because Kyle doesn't wanna hear how it ends."
258,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No, it all worked out, right? The world was saved and I went home for Christmas dinner."
259,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, why do you care?!"
260,8,14,Stan Marsh,Well after all that I at least wanna know if I had a merry Christmas or if darkness rules the Earth.
261,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,Oh come on! It's obvious what happens! I get killed by Santa Claus so that Christmas is saved!
262,8,14,Eric Cartman,That's not at all what happens.
263,8,14,Butters Stotch,"Aw well, come on. Let him read us the end."
264,8,14,Clyde Donovan,"Yeah yeah, come on! [the other kids chime in]"
265,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"All right, fine!"
266,8,14,Eric Cartman,"[He returns to the stool and resumes the story. He clears his throat.] ""Oh dear, my best friend is possessed! How about that?"" said the little boy in the red poofball hat."
267,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"HAHAHAA! Now I shall rule the -- [feels something...] Aww. Uuugh. God it burns! AAAH! My soul is on fire! Whoa! Oh, I don't like this! [hops off the altar] I didn't know it would feel so... dark and evil!"
268,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Well what did you expect, dude? It's the son of the Devil."
269,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Oh God, what have I done?! [sits down] I'm sorry. Please, I don't wanna be the vessel for the Antichrist."
270,8,14,Santa Claus,"[with his shotgun at the ready] I'm sorry, but it's too late, Kyle! Santa's gonna have to kill you! [pumps the shotgun]"
271,8,14,Stan Marsh,"No Santa, don't!"
272,8,14,Santa Claus,"We don't have a choice. In a few hours, the dark creature inside him will consume his soul."
273,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The little boy fretted. He almost started to bawl,
But that's when he came up with the best idea of all."
274,8,14,Stan Marsh,The lion cubs!
275,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"The little boy quickly begun,"
276,8,14,Stan Marsh,I took them to see how abortions are done.
277,8,14,Santa Claus,What?
278,8,14,Stan Marsh,"Now cubs, do like they showed you. Hurry up fast!
Get the Antichrist out of my friend Kyle's ass!"
279,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And in the twinkling starlight, each little cub did their portion.
They remembered all they had learned and gave Kyle an abortion."
280,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"Thanks, everybody. I'm sorry I got a little crazy there."
281,8,14,Santa Claus,"Well little boy, it seems that you [points to Stan] have really been through a lot. Is there any special present you would like this year?"
282,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[smiles] Yeah. Yeah, there is."
283,8,14,Mother Lion,"Wha -- Oh my, what happened?"
284,8,14,One of the Cubs,[the three of them run up to greet her] Mommy?
285,8,14,The Mountain Lion's Cubs,"Yay! You're back! We missed you, Mommy!"
286,8,14,Stan Marsh,"[relieved] Oh, good."
287,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And back home, there were presents, and lots of food to get fat.
And it was the best Christmas ever for the boy in the red poofball hat."
288,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later. [Q shot of Kyle back in the hospital, dying.]"
289,8,14,Kyle Broflovski,"[voice-over] Goddammit, Cartman!"
290,8,14,Narrator and Singers,"[as credits roll]
Christmastime is once a year,
Every creature holds it dear,
Every animal big or small,
Christmas means the world to us all,
It's once a year, it's Christmastime,
When we hear about how Christmas only comes
Once a year."
