0,10,8,Eric Cartman,"[as the dwarf, with mallet] Oh, dude! I just took the biggest crap. Hey-where are you guys?"
1,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[voice only] We're over here, by the cart. [POV switches to three other characters - a blue knight, a green lady, and an orange knight stand around waiting for the dwarf. The dwarf walks into the group]"
2,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, I'm back."
3,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[the blue knight, with sword and shield] Dude! We've been waiting forever!"
4,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Well, I'm sorry, I had to take a dump!"
5,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[the green lady with big breasts] If you didn't eat so much, you wouldn't have diarrhea all the time, fatass!"
6,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Hey, I don't need to take any lip from a frickin' girl!"
7,10,8,Kenny McCormick,"[mumbles, then] (I think Kyle has fake titties, hahahaha)"
8,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Heheh, totally, heheh."
9,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Come on, we have to finish the quest in Stonehaven. [walks off, and the others follow]"
10,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[voice only] Stan? [Stan stops] Stan?
11,10,8,Stan Marsh,"H-hang on, guys, my dad wants something."
12,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stan!
13,10,8,Stan Marsh,What?!
14,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[displeased] You've been on your computer all weekend. Shouldn't you go out and socialize with your friends?
15,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[swivels around to face his dad] I am socializing, r-tard. I'm logged on to an MMORPG with people from all over the world, and getting XP with my party using TeamSpeak."
16,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[stares, then gets dejected] ...I'm not a r-tard. [turns and leaves. Stan returns to his game]"
17,10,8,Stan Marsh,"All right, sorry guys. So where to now?"
18,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"See where I am? It's this way. [Stan joins the group. Kyle's character turns around, realizes its mistake, and jumps back around]"
19,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, come on, let's go! [the four now walk abreast] I am the mightiest dwarf in all of Azeroth!"
20,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Wow, look at all these people playing right now."
21,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Yeah, it's bullcrap. I'll bet half these of these people are Koreans."
22,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[stops and motions] Oh crap! It's that guy again! [a player approaches them and begins to dance. The character is wearing a helmet, boots, elbow-length gloves, and tight shorts. No shirt, no other armor]"
23,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Who is this?
24,10,8,Stan Marsh,This is the guy that kept killing us after you went to bed!
25,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Get out of here, asshole!"
26,10,8,Stan Marsh,He's a way higher level than us. It isn't fair.
27,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"It's all right. He can't kill us unless we agree to duel. [the ganker jabs at Kenny, who immediately dies.]"
28,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh my God, he killed Kenny!"
29,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"[in a soft feminine voice, makes a fist and holds it up for emphasis] You bastard! [the ganker stabs Kyle and then Stan, who both drop and die]"
30,10,8,Eric Cartman,Don't you have better things to do than going online killing people?! [the ganker begins generating power] No! I don't want them to start over at the graveyard! [the ganker shoots a fireball at Cartman] No! [the fireball hits and Cartman falls face down and dies.]
31,10,8,Eric Cartman,That sonofabitch!
32,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Who is that guy?
33,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[head resting on left hand] Whoever he is, he is one tough badass."
34,10,8,Rep,[female] World of Warcraft support line.
35,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Yeah, we bought your game, and played it online, but every time we log in, some other player comes in and kills us!"
36,10,8,Rep,O..ohhh that shouldn't happen. We designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other.
37,10,8,Stan Marsh,Yeah? Well this guy does it anyway!
38,10,8,Eric Cartman,He's a God damned butthole!
39,10,8,Rep,Really? That's odd. [her co-worker approaches. She muffles the mic to talk to him] More people calling in about their characters getting killed. [removes her hand]
40,10,8,Co Worker,Oh no.
41,10,8,Rep,"Well, we'll certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network. [She muffles the mic] Better tell the guys upstairs."
42,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Fellow board members, we have a problem: somebody in the World of Warcraft is ignoring the World's rules...and is going around killing innocent players.."
43,10,8,Member 1,Why kill innocent players? The game is about finishing quests.
44,10,8,Member 2,We've got to delete him from the servers.
45,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","We can't. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft so much, that he has reached a level we thought unreachable. He's actually able to kill our admins. And he grows stronger every day."
46,10,8,Member 3,Jesus...
47,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",[rises from his chair] I've gotta get home! My kids are playing World of Warcraft right now!
48,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Jim, your kids' characters are already dead."
49,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",No... [sinks back into his seat] No... [frustrated] They just started playing!
50,10,8,Member 2,What kind of person would do this?
51,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","[walks back to the end of the table, by the doors] Only one kind. Whoever this player is, he has played World of Warcraft nearly every hour of every day for the past year and a half. Gentlemen, we are dealing with someone here who...haw absolutely no life."
52,10,8,Member 3,How do you kill...that which has no life? [the question hangs there for a long time...]
53,10,8,Nelson,"[walks into view] Randy, you workin' on that sediment analysis?"
54,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Not now, Nelson. I just joined a big party of night elves and we're gonna explore the Tower of Azora together."
55,10,8,Nelson,[walks up to Randy's desk] Is that a computer game?
56,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"No, r-tard, it's an MMORPG. These are real people I'm playing with. See, I'm a hunter, level 2. [he moves his blond character around] I can chat with all these other people. I can even wave to this guy, see? [demonstrates.] ""Hello."" [the character waves back] In the outside world, I'm a simple geologist, but in here...I am Falcorn, Defender of the Alliance. I've braved the Fargodeep mine and defeated the Bloodfish at Jarod's Landing. [the griefer returns and stabs Falcorn in the back, killing him, then walks away]"
57,10,8,Nelson,Hm. Looks like that guy just killed you. [turns around and walks away]
58,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,What?? Why?? Why?!
59,10,8,Eric Cartman,"My friends: as you all know, some giant butthole keeps logging onto Warcraft and killing all our characters."
60,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"The past...four nights we've tried to play, he shows up and kills us!"
61,10,8,Craig Tucker,He killed my character right in the middle of a quest!
62,10,8,Tweek Tweak,Mine too!
63,10,8,Eric Cartman,"We've learned that the four of us can't fight him alone. But, if we all log in together!, we might have a chance."
64,10,8,Token Black,Hey yeah!
65,10,8,Jimmy Valmer,We can really stick it to that assm-m-muncher!
66,10,8,Clyde Donovan,"Are you guys dumb? We can't beat him, even with all of us. It's a waste of time."
67,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we have to try."
68,10,8,Clyde Donovan,I've got better things to do.
69,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Clyde, Clyde! [moves around his podium to talk to Clyde more directly] If you had a chance right now to go back in time and stop Hitler, wouldn't you do it? [beat] I mean, I personally wouldn't stop him because I think he was awesome, but you would, right?"
70,10,8,Clyde Donovan,[unshaken] I'm just gonna stop playing.
71,10,8,Eric Cartman,"When Hitler rose to power there were a lot of people who just stopped playing. You know who those people were? The French! Are you French, Clyde?"
72,10,8,Clyde Donovan,No.
73,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, Clyde?"
74,10,8,Clyde Donovan,"All right all right, I'll do it!"
75,10,8,Jimmy Valmer,So what's the p-plan?
76,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, you all login from your computers at precisely 7:30. [walks up to a map of their quest] We will meet here, on the plains of the elven forest near Westfall. My friends, to victory!"
77,10,8,All,To victory!
78,10,8,Butters Stotch,I don't play World of Warcraft.
79,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, you said you were on your computer all the time!"
80,10,8,Butters Stotch,"Yeah, but I'm playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure."
81,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Butters, go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you."
82,10,8,Butters Stotch,"O-oh, o-oh, a-alright. All right then."
83,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, you guys, this is it! When the attack begins, all warriors click on defensive stance. Everyone else, wait for Craig to cast his intellect buff."
84,10,8,Token Black,[playing a black warrior] Okay.
85,10,8,Craig Tucker,Got it.
86,10,8,Eric Cartman,"The battle is sure to be long, so make sure you all have your special abilities macroed to your keyboards."
87,10,8,Jimmy Valmer,"All right, Eric. You can c-c-count on us."
88,10,8,Timmy Burch,Timmy!
89,10,8,Eric Cartman,This shall be a day for all to remember! Let us bravely charge the fields of Azeroth! [another dwarf walks in looking just like Cartman's dwarf] From with-
90,10,8,Butters Stotch,"Hey fellas! [Cartman's dwarf looks over] Boy, this is neato, huh?"
91,10,8,Eric Cartman,Butters? What the hell are you doing?
92,10,8,Butters Stotch,"I got World of Warcraft, like you said."
93,10,8,Eric Cartman,"You can't be the dwarf character, Butters, I'm the dwarf."
94,10,8,Butters Stotch,"Well, there's only like four races to choose from-"
95,10,8,Eric Cartman,"So pick another one! I'm the dwarf, you stupid asshole! Log out, create a new character, and log back in!"
96,10,8,Butters Stotch,[walks off grumbling] I like Hello Kitty Island Adventure a lot more 'n this stuff.
97,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Come on, let's do this!"
98,10,8,Jason White,"Yeah, my mom says I have to be in bed at 9:30."
99,10,8,Eric Cartman,[turns around and leads] Then let's move out! [the others charge after him]
100,10,8,Stan Marsh,Look! There he is!
101,10,8,Eric Cartman,Everyone hold! [everyone stops in their tracks. The ganker turns around and faces them.]
102,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,He's targeting us.
103,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Prepare to charge! Scroll over him with your mouse cursors! And...Right-click! [that sends the group charging at the ganker, who responds by summoning an army of giant scorpions] What the? Oh Jesus, he summoned scorpions! [the actual rogue player is shown in his apartment, leaning back on his chair and playing without needing to think very much about what to do next. His character and scorpions decimate the group]"
104,10,8,Tweek Tweak,"Aaaa! [his character runs all over the place, with no one offering to smother him and put out the flames] I'm burning! Oh Jesus I'm burning! [a scorpion kills another character nearby]"
105,10,8,Jimmy Valmer,"Kenny's down. K-k-kenny is down. [Tweek is still burning, running around]"
106,10,8,Ike Broflovski,[purple mage] I have poop on my pants.
107,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Ike, look out! [the ganker rushes in and stabs him, and Ike is out of the game. Stan runs through a group of scorpions]"
108,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, Clyde, hit him with your crossbow! [Clyde's character looks like he's about to swing at a baseball] Hit him now, Clyde! Clyde? Clyde! [Clyde is at his computer, but not participating in the game. He's looking at Playboy centerfolds.] Clyde! Clyde, you asshole! [rushes to join the others] Goddammit we lost Clyde!"
109,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Hey, Stan, can I play with you guys? [Stan's character turns around]"
110,10,8,Stan Marsh,Dad??
111,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Yeah, I'm playing from the office."
112,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, get off our teamspeak line!"
113,10,8,Token Black,"[the ganker kills him] That's it, I'm dead!"
114,10,8,Stan Marsh,"[the ganker kills him. He throws off his headset again] That's it, screw this game!"
115,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Now, leave me alone, don't do- [the ganker electrocutes Cartman with his dagger through the mallet] that, dugh [Cartman dies, and the ganker skips away. Cartman screams into his mic, then throws down his headset] God-fucking-dammit!!! [meanwhile, in his apartment, the ganker just keeps plugging along.]"
116,10,8,Member 3,Oh Jesus...Oh God no...
117,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",What?
118,10,8,Member 3,He just finished killing every single player in the Arathi Highlands.
119,10,8,Member 1,How many people's characters were in there?
120,10,8,Member 2,Over five thousand. [some of the members sit down. Member 1 rises]
121,10,8,Member 1,"There are over seven million people who log on to World of Warcraft! Are you telling me all those people's characters are going to die, and there's nothing we can do to save them?"
122,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Yes. And it won't be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether. Gentlemen, this could very well lead to the end of the World...of Warcraft."
123,10,8,Member 5,[grabs his head] No! Nooooooooo!
124,10,8,Eric Cartman,What the hell are you guys doing?? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?!
125,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, we're done. we're sick of getting killed all the time."
126,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world. Of Warcraft."
127,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"We don't have a choice, dude. That guy killed our characters 14 times."
128,10,8,Eric Cartman,"I have a solution, you guys. That guy can kill us so easily because he's a super-high level, right? What if we were super-high level too?"
129,10,8,Stan Marsh,We can't get to a higher level because that dude doesn't let us finish quests!
130,10,8,Eric Cartman,"That's why we just need to log in and stay in the forest, killing boars."
131,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Boars?
132,10,8,Eric Cartman,There's lots of computer-generated boars in Warcraft that die with just one blow.
133,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, boars are only worth two experience points apiece. Do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels?"
134,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Yes. [whips out a sheet full of calculations] Sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five. Which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes, giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep. What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around, [firmly] or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters."
135,10,8,Paul Stanley,"Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes!Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall!Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winYeah! [...and back into night...Stan's first pimples appear and his face is fatter.]Live! [More pimples appear, and his hair begins to look matted]Yeah!Win! [He's gotten fatter than Cartman normally is, to the point where he's too fat to wear his jacket anymore]''"
136,10,8,Member 3,"Sir, you'd better have a look at this! Four of our subscribers...They've gone up fifty levels in three weeks."
137,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",My God...they must have no lives at all.
138,10,8,Member 3,A hope?
139,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",A chance.
140,10,8,Paul Stanley,"Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyesLive to win, take it all, just keep fighting 'till you fall<p>Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' inLet another round begin, live to winLive to winLive to winYeah, win"
141,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Dude, my mouse-clicking finger hurts."
142,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Keep clicking, Kyle! You can do it!"
143,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",The admins tell us they are four players from a small town in Colorado.
144,10,8,Member 1,Are they strong enough to defeat the Evil One?
145,10,8,Member 5,"[wearing a black T-shirt with the green words ""Dwarf Needs FOOD!"" on it] We ran the numbers: even with their amazing rise in levels, they have a 90% mortality probability. They'd be walking in a slaughter!"
146,10,8,Member 1,There has to be...someway we can help them.
147,10,8,Member 6,What about...the Sword of a Thousand Truths?
148,10,8,Member 7,"Quiet, Thomas! We aren't even to speak of that sword!"
149,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",But maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of.
150,10,8,Member 7,It is not an option!
151,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",What is this sword?
152,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Long ago, when the World of Warcraft was created, one of the programmers put a sword called the Sword of a Thousand Truths into the game inventory. Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80."
153,10,8,Member 7,But the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess. So it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive.
154,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","But it was foretold that one day, players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves."
155,10,8,Member 1,Who foretold this prophecy?
156,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",Soltzman. He's an accountant.
157,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Behold, the Sword of a Thousand Truths. [the flash drive gets its close-up] We must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life. Let's just hope to Christ they don't start the battle before we can reach them."
158,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, you guys. The Moment of Truth is here. It is time for our final battle. Everyone, log in!"
159,10,8,Stan Marsh,I'm in.
160,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Me too.
161,10,8,Kenny McCormick,(Me too.)
162,10,8,Eric Cartman,"[begins to slur his speech ever so slightly, giving it a blasé feel] Everyone equip healing potions to the hotbar if you haven't already. Uh, Kyle, go ahead and cast Arcane Brilliance to raise our intelligence."
163,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hang on, I'm chaining my fire spells for max range."
164,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Nice. Stan, what enchantment does your Cloak of the Tiger have?"
165,10,8,Stan Marsh,+15 agility.
166,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Give the cloak to Kenny, he needs the agility boost for bow attacks."
167,10,8,Stan Marsh,'K.
168,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Hold on, this fight could last more than twelve hours. What if we run out of food?"
169,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Don't worry, I have that covered. [pressed a button on a small intercom on his desk] Mom?"
170,10,8,Liane Cartman,Yes hon?
171,10,8,Eric Cartman,More Hot Pockets!
172,10,8,Liane Cartman,"[answering at the other end] Right away, hon. [Cartman turns it off]"
173,10,8,Stan Marsh,That's übercool.
174,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, everyone ready?"
175,10,8,Kyle Stan,Ready.
176,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Let's go get him! [the battle begins. The rogue is playing with the right hand, eating a cookie with the left.]"
177,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Wait, I think I see him. Yeah, yeah, he's here in Goldshire."
178,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, everyone open your uplifts and autolocate to Stan."
179,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,What's the autolocate macro?
180,10,8,Eric Cartman,Command-0. [sniffs]
181,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Okay, right behind Stan."
182,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Kenny, get ready to turn on true-shot aura. At that moment, I will use intimidating shout."
183,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Okay, he sees us...He's targeted us."
184,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Okay, hit him with pyroblast, Kyle."
185,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Casting...there's an 8-second cast time.
186,10,8,Eric Cartman,Aren't you spec'd to reduce cast time?
187,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"No, ah, I'm an arcane fire mage."
188,10,8,Eric Cartman,Christ...
189,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Cast on him again.
190,10,8,Eric Cartman,Everyone target scorpions.
191,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Yes?
192,10,8,Member 1,We are looking for a great knight by the name of LovesToSpooge.
193,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,That's my son's character's name in Warcraft.
194,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",Where is he?!
195,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Who are you?
196,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas","Sir, we don't have time! We just heard from our admins that your son's party is already in battle!"
197,10,8,Member 1,"Unless they have this sword, [pulls out the flash drive] your son's character is going to die!"
198,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[close-up, Randy's eyes widen] Nn-Oh my God! [drops his coffee cup and runs upstairs. The two other men look at each other and follow]"
199,10,8,Eric Cartman,Kyle! Fire spell!
200,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Aaaa... [starts generating the spell, but it abruptly goes out] AH! Huh?! [his character grabs her right wrist with her left hand]"
201,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle! [Kyle leaves his desk grabbing onto his right hand, then flexes his right wrist around. Stan leaves his desk and approaches him] Kyle! Dude, what's wrong?"
202,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,Carpal tunnel! Carpal tunnel! It's aaaah! [pain shoots through his wrist as he continues flexing his wrist and stretching his fingers]
203,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Oh, Jesus, he's got it bad! [Cartman walks over]"
204,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Wait, we need Ben-Gay. [waddles to Kenny's desk desk and pulls out a tube of the stuff, then walks back and squirts some of it onto Kyle's right wrist, then rubs it in.]"
205,10,8,Stan Marsh,Hurry dude!
206,10,8,Eric Cartman,I'm going as fast as I can!
207,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Kyle, you have to keep playing."
208,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,I can't. Just leave me behind.
209,10,8,Stan Marsh,We can't do this without you now! Come on! [he and Cartman help Kyle back to his computer]
210,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Stan?! Stan! [turns around and sees Sharon walk by with the laundry] Sharon, where is Stan?!"
211,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,I don't know. He took his computer somewhere to play that stupid online game.
212,10,8,Member 1,Stupid?
213,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Where?!
214,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,I don't know.
215,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Sharon, his character is going to die if we don't get to him!"
216,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,So what?
217,10,8,The three men,So what?! [Sharon rolls her eyes and walks away]
218,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",We're too late. Without the sword the players will fail.
219,10,8,Member 1,"Ih if we could get to a computer, we could sign on to the World of Warcraft and give the boys the sword online."
220,10,8,"Blizzard Gaming Entertainment President and his board members, including Jim and Thomas",I don't have a World of Warcraft account. Do you?
221,10,8,Member 1,"No, I have a life. [the men fall silent]"
222,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Give me the sword.
223,10,8,Member 1,You?
224,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"I have a Warcraft character. I'm a newb, but I can log on and get the sword to Stan online."
225,10,8,Member 1,We can't trust the Sword of a Thousand Truths to a newb!
226,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Sounds to me like we don't have a choice! Give me the sword. [Member 1 kneels and reverently gives the USB drive to Randy. Randy holds it above his head like an actual sword] Ahhhh. Come on, we've got to get to a computer that works! [runs out of the house with the other two men behind him]"
227,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Where's your car?
228,10,8,Member 1,We took a cab here!
229,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Dammit, mine's in the shop! [runs out into the street] Uh hey! Eh help! Stop! [a car slows down] Please, it's an emergency! [the driver opens his door, Randy yanks him out and knocks him out with one punch. Randy and the other two men get in the car and speed away. The driver comes to and looks on. Randy is now on his cell phone] Nelson! Nelson, I need to come over and use your computer! No, I d-I need to play World of Warcraft! NELSON!"
230,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, major stone shield potions should be...Oh God, I'm going to have diarrhea again. Ohhh...Duuuh..."
231,10,8,Stan Marsh,"You can't go to the bathroom, you're stacking sunder armor!"
232,10,8,Eric Cartman,It's okay. [clicks on the intercom] Mom? Bathroom!
233,10,8,Liane Cartman,What hon?
234,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Bathroom! Bathroom! [clicks off. A second later Liane goes into the basement with a bedpan. Cartman sense this and lowers his pants as Liane positions the bedpan in place. Cartman lets go and a log comes out first, followed by a spattering stream of crap. Some of it ends up on the floor, some of it on Liane's blouse. Nasty.]"
235,10,8,Liane Cartman,"Oohh, that's a big boy, isn't he? [walks away with the poop. Cartman lifts his pants back in place without cleaning his ass]"
236,10,8,Eric Cartman,"All right, Kenny, drink your elixir of the mongoose. I'm now going to use mocking blow."
237,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,World of Warcraft! I need to play!
238,10,8,Best Buy Greeter,Our demo is set up right over by the- [Randy runs to the demo. A small boy is playing the game. Randy shoves him off and logs him out.]
239,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Got to...sign in...character name...All right, I'm in! [puts on the headset]"
240,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dude, I'm almost dead."
241,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Kyle, cast arcane missile!"
242,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"I'm out of mana, I told you."
243,10,8,Stan Marsh,[his character leaves the battle] I've gotta heal. [his character turns to see the battle]
244,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"Staaan! [Stan's character looks around trying to determine where the voice is coming from, then turns around]"
245,10,8,Stan Marsh,Dad? Not now!
246,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stan! I've been sent here...to bring you this. [holds the Sword of a Thousand Truths aloft] This sword can completely drain his mana.
247,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, how did you get that?!"
248,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"No time! Just take it! Here! [the sword stays fixed to his left hand] ...How, how do you hand something from one player to another?"
249,10,8,Stan Marsh,Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
250,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Okay. [The ganker notices the lull in action and faces Stan. Cartman is alarmed and spins around to look at Stan.]
251,10,8,Eric Cartman,"Stan, what the hell are you doing?! [the ganker runs and leaps toward Stan and Randy]"
252,10,8,Stan Marsh,I got it! [the ganker stabs Randy and Randy goes down]
253,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Augh!
254,10,8,Stan Marsh,Dad!
255,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,Stan... [falls down face first]
256,10,8,Stan Marsh,"Dad, no! [turns around to face the ganker] You killed my father. [walks up to the ganker and strikes him with one blow of the sword. The ganker's defenses start to crack.]"
257,10,8,Eric Cartman,His shield and armor spells are down!
258,10,8,Kyle Broflovski,"Attack! [Kenny quickly takes his bow and arrow and fires an arrow into the ganker's chest. Kyle fires an energy ball at the ganker. The energy ball knocks the knife from the ganker's hand and disables him some more. He falls to the ground on all fours, and the dwarf approaches him, ready to smash the ganker's head in with the mallet]"
259,10,8,Eric Cartman,Looks like you're about to get pwned. [swings back and then pulls the mallet forward] Heeyeah! [the mallet smashed the ganker's head into little bloody pieces.]
260,10,8,Stan Marsh,Dad? Dad?
261,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,"[answers] Staaan. [falters a bit, but Stan holds him up] I've never been able to say this before, but...I love you, son."
262,10,8,Stan Marsh,"I know you do, Dad."
263,10,8,Randy and Sharon Marsh,[swats Stan's hand away] Augh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
